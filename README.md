# Can Reddit predict traded stock volume?

Collaborative project with Petr Cala for IES Course Data Processing in Python. We scrape mentions of stock tickers on selected subreddits using Reddit API, and daily trading volume of featured stocks from Yahoo finance. We determine the relationship between frequency of reddit mentions of stocks, and their actual traded volume in upcoming days.
