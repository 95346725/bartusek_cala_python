I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial. This might be a fairly long post but I thought since the broad masses here probably don't know some of these companies I thought I'd make it a bit more comprehensive than just posting some tickers and percentages.

Below I have listed the companies, how large a % of my portfolio they are, what country their HQ is located in, what strategy I put them in (see above), what their market cap in billion USD is, my unrealized gain (currency effect), gain of first purchase price (no currency effect) and a very brief description of their business.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

They drive the market down really quickly and then sit until all the ""small players"" throw their money in. The 2 to 3 percent moves over 20 minutes followed by .1 percent moves every 20 minutes following. I don't think it's really all these ""paper hands"" selling as much as big money pushing the market around so they can make money. When things trade sideways they don't make money.

If you could move the market you would want to push prices down (short sell) along with some small ""bad news"" event to spark fear. Wait for the buyers to scoop up shares until things recover 25 percent and then drive the price back down again. 

At the end of the day a lot of people are on edge so there is more money to be made pushing the market lower then there is pushing it higher. At least in the next couple of week.

His strategy seemed to be targeting resource companies that make money not directly from extraction, but through from some complicated financing of their operations that I didn’t really understand.

NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  

I like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated.","['AMD', 'NVDA']"
n4e3w6,gwv44a2,stocks,comment,1620097300,"Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:

Revenue:

NVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)

Gross Profit:

NVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)

Income Before Taxes:

NVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).

Net Income:

NVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).

So what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.","['AMD', 'NVDA']"
n4e3w6,gwvu7wu,stocks,comment,1620116482,"As someone in an industry that largely depends on video cards (game design), I can give a simple answer. NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.

That said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult.","['INTC', 'AMD', 'NVDA']"
n4e3w6,gwv4sof,stocks,comment,1620097665,"AMD has only relatively recently obtained such growth. With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. 

After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. 

TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD.","['INTC', 'AMD', 'NVDA']"

If you're looking at your portfolio and it's really doing a number on your stomach, **you need to reevaluate your positions**.

Maybe you took more risk than you wanted to. Maybe you put too much in a risky position. Maybe you bought into the hype. Maybe you thought with your heart and said ""[insert company] will never go away so it must go up!""

Well, you're here now. What's your plan?

**COME UP WITH A PLAN**

Good investors come up with plans. They don't sell on red days or green days. They sell when something happens that changes their initial reasons for buying.

Are you going to hold forever? Are you selling before earnings? Are you selling if it gets to whatever price? Are you going to keep buying? 

You must have a plan. Once you have this plan...

**STICK TO THE PLAN**

Do not deviate. Don't say ""maybe it will come back up"" or ""maybe it will come back down"". Sticking to your plan is crucial. This is how you can manage your risk. It doesn't matter what happens in the next day or week or year. You did what you thought was the best action to take in the moment because you stuck to your plan. In time, you will tweak your plan to maximize your potential and minimize your downside. Don't look back at a position and feel great or bad. Just evaluate whether you made the right decision based on the information you were working with at the time.

**TAKE YOUR EMOTIONS OUT OF THE EQUATION**

Do you think Warren Buffett panics every time there's a red day? Absolutely not. Then why should you? If you let your emotions get the best of you, you WILL do something stupid. The stock market does not care, so why should you?

There are going to be many red days ahead. Are you ready for them?

See you tomorrow!

Now when we calculate P/E ratio, we do stock price / EPS. My question is why is it now fair to use the EPS when we add the stock price in to the equation to compare the two companies.

n4u0o3,,stocks,post,1620149116,"Short selling against the boxI recently learned about short selling against the box and since most people don't know what this means I thought some of you might benefit from my mistake.  


**What is Short selling against the box?**   
This happens when you have a long position and you short it while keeping your long. For example, if you own 10 shares of TSLA and you short 3 and don't sell your long - you create a boxed short. *This means your broker can close out you out of your short position at any time if they need to cover the shorts they have from other accounts for X reasons.* Not only that but my broker not just covered my short but also sold the equal amount of longs to cover my short even though I had cash to cover it. At the end of the day this means I was left with 7 shares without ever have any control of it how it was executed. Lastly, you could hold that short for months and months without anything ever happening but as soon as the broker needs to cover other shorts they will close your boxed position. I held mine for almost 9 months without anyone saying anything or any alert being shown communicating it would be closed out at any time.

**Why is this prohibited?**   
From a broker standpoint they use this rule to have liquidity to cover their shorts at any time needed including if you actually own those shares. From a tax standpoint, before 1997 you could have used a box short as a way to avoid paying taxes on your gains for a period of time.

**How to circumvent this rule?**  
Create a separate account and hold the short there. If you only have a short position it's not considered a box position.

n4ooad,,stocks,post,1620135887,"DD: $ASO - Lawyers, Guns, and MoneyIf you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation.",['PEG']

n3vqmp,,stocks,post,1620047705,"Uranium market update, one of the biggest catalysts to date is about to be in place.To say we had an interesting few weeks in the uranium sector would be a massive understatement. We have seen new geopolitical support for nuclear power and a massive new catalyst in the form of the newly formed Sprott Uranium Trust (more on that later). There was also a new version released of the Bear Traps Report, a popular type of newsletter that in the words of John Quakes is “send to thousands of Wall Street money managers”. It is also believed that the initial run up was sparked by the sharing of a similar Bear Traps Report article around November/December of last year, sparking the first leg up with institutional capital positioning in the sector. There is \*a lot\* happening beneath the surface and the coming few months will, in my view, prove to be significant.

Here is the first part of the Bear Traps Report with my own added comments as well:

In 2020, six nuclear reactors were connected to the gnd. Of these, Belarus and the UAE opened their first nuclear reactors. This, despite the pandemic. We expect this trend to continue over the balance of the century. There are currently 108 planned nuclear reactors globally at various stages of the approval funding process. Different countries get different percentages from nuclear reactors, a sample: China, 4.9%; India, 3.2%, Japan, 7.5%, UK 15.6%, USA, 19.7%. The take away is that between China, the UK and the USA, alone, there is plenty of potential growth in nuclear reactor electricity supply and, of course, these countries have the financial wherewithal to fund the requisite nuclear reactors to go green should consensus so direct.

Production from mining (in tonnes U) for 2019 was. 22,808 from Kazakhstan: 6,938 from Canada, 6,613 from Australia, 5,476 from Namibia, estimated 3,500 from Uzbekistan 2,983 from Russia, estimated 1,885 from China, 801 from Ukraine, and 67 from the USA Production in the U.S. has been in steady decline: 2014 = 1,919, 2015 = 1,256, 2016 = 1,125, 2017 = 940, 2018 = 582, 2019 = 67. 

The main takeaway here is there is a seemingly strong geopolitical risk component to Uranium supply. U.S. production has essentially evaporated, an extremely bullish fact for forward Uranium pricing given Biden's pro-nuclear stance. Production of Uranium concentrate in the U.S. has fallen steeply and steadily (pounds U308): 2,422,789 for 2017, 1,446,496 for 2018, 173,875 for 2019. In the first quarter of 2020-8,989 vs 58,481 in first quarter 2019 vs 226,780 first quarter 2018 and 450,215 first quarter of 2017.  
 

Overall, nuclear power provides about 11% of global electricity output. Demand grows alapually in the single digits. Because of low prices, global Uranium supply is down 25%. If prices double, mines will reopen and consolidate. If the U.S. alone decides to go big on nuclear prices will at least double. And assuming prices double, supply will be adequate to power U.S. nuclear ambitions. It goes both ways. The U.S. produces but 7% of its own demand, with 93% dependent on imports. ""For strategic issues such as power supply and defense, this is not a healthy situation, and therefore the plan was made for a strategic stockpile, ""Gabi Schneider, the executive director of the Namibian Uranium Institute, explains, adding it is ultimately the US's goal to expand uranium production domestically in order to shrink, or halt outright, U.S. imports of Uranium. 

The U.S. goverment's Uranium strategic stockpile effort passed last December is a key, and telling, first step. At the state level, legislatures have begun passing laws that set up support for nuclear reactors. This represents a big shift from half a century ago. The Biden administration is pro-nuclear power. China's nuclear reactor capacity is set to grow from 46 GWe in 2020 to 108 GWe by 2030. We expect ground to be broken for nuclear reactors over the balance of this decade in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Poland. Projects have begun in Turkey, Bangladesh and Egypt. So it's not just a question of the wealthiest countries jumping in. 

Consensus thought on Uranium has been remarkably stupid, missing the supply cuts, missing the 5x move in conversion prices (UF6), missing the 40% rise in SWU (enrichment) prices, and missing the recent run up in spot prices (U308). Basically, consensus can't even think one step ahead when it comes to basic economics. It didn't occur to them that money losing mines would be shut down.

The US needs to guarantee greater uranium supply. For that it needs U.S. mines to reopen and consolidate. For that Uranium prices have to double. The new U.S. Uranium stockpile could prove a key component to that price shift. Uranium just entered supply deficit Kazakhstan's Uranium production forecast is for its Uranium production to peak next year and to go into serious decline post 2030.

All of this comes down to one simple fact, it is that we are running out of time for uranium prices to get going and the longer this doesn’t happen, the higher the eventual price overshoot to try and make up for a decade of lost capex investments and exploration. If utilities come to the table within the next 12 months, some form of price control can be asserted and perhaps a slower run up into a price of roughly 60-65 dollars with a small overshoot to around 80 dollars by 2024 might be the most probable scenario. If they don’t though, we might be looking at triple digit uranium once more. One massive new catalyst that was brought to the table recently was the fact the coming into existence of the Sprott Uranium Trust. The bear traps report names 9 reasons why this will likely have significant implications for the broad uranium market:  


Uranium Participation Corp was a company that was buying U and sitting on it, the original yellow cake. The market will now have daily price discovery and a retail / family office / small asset manager speculation vehicle. This is a game changer. Now we have a new team taking over (Sprott). Very bullish for uranium. Why? Here is why:

1. We are getting a U.S. listed vehicle with a physical redemption Like a GLD for uranium. Look at PSLV and PHYS, equivalent.

2. A new mechanism for retail, institutional. An at the market facility. Technically a closed end fund, NOT a GLD.

3. Pounds come in, don't go out. They could do a buyback if the market provides that opportunity.

4. Uranium Participation Corp is tough to buy, pink sheet. Many online brokers didn’t offer it, but now there will be a new liquidity vehicle that is far more widely available.

5. Management transition from Denison to Sprott. Think Industry player to real asset mgr.

6. When there is large premium new buyers are vulnerable. This has suppressed upside momentum NOW there is a liquid vehicle, large buyers can come in with a liquidity work out.

7. Next, Sprott does a big offering to bring in new pounds into the fund. There was too much inventory of uranium in the system, this vehicle will eliminate this problem. New size buyers of the fund will quickly translate into spot buying!

8. Think CME and oil this could be a new real franchise /a liquidity central facility

9. Management take over might take 2/3 months. Then the premium U Part will come in, was 16% today in a month or so Dan Loeb can come in and buy $100m without the premium risk pounds will permanently be removed from the mkt NOT an ETF, it’s a closed end fund. A discount may develop in the shares but new buyers are in a much better spot.

&#x200B;

That marks the end of this uranium market update and I hope you enjoyed the read. With so much happening both in front as well as behind the scenes, hopefully I can be of aid to help you traverse this opaque market in the best way possible. We are at the foot of what will undoubtably prove to be a generational event, but it will be an extremely volatile and wild market all the way up and eventually down as well.

n4wwl5,,stocks,post,1620159022,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 4, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 4, 2021**

Stocks fell on Thursday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street's response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Together, our teams are already hard at work connecting Discord with your social and gaming experience on PlayStation Network. Our goal is to bring the Discord and PlayStation experiences closer together on console and mobile starting early next year, allowing friends, groups, and communities to hang out, have fun, and communicate more easily while playing games together.

To bring these experiences to life for our players, Sony Interactive Entertainment has made a minority investment as part of Discord’s Series H round. From our very first conversation with co-founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy, I was inspired by their lifelong love for gaming and our teams’ shared passion to help bring friends and communities together in new ways. Empowering players to create communities and enjoy shared gaming experiences is at the heart of what we do, so we are beyond excited to start this journey with one of the world’s most popular communication services.

I have family who have stocks, hell I was purchased Disney stocks when I was young and I know they're supposedly a good way to make decent money/have a life preserver should something happen, but how do you actually get started?

Like what would be a good initial investment to understand how this all works or better, what's something I could watch/read that might help me wrap my head around how all this works?

&#x200B;

Any advice is welcome, I am a COMPLETE novice when it comes to this but I'd really like to learn and understand. Thanks in advance :)

Edit: thanks everyone for your great help so far. You've all given me a lot of stuff to read over, watch, etc. To hopefully get a good grasp on this system.
I'll admit none of this has ever been my forte but I think thanks to a lot of the people on here im starting to get a decent idea of at least a good basis to work from. Once more, thank you all",

That's what I did during the pandemic crash last year when my portfolio value dropped by 1/3 in 2 weeks.  Had I panicked and sold all of my stocks and gone to cash, I would have been hesitant to buy back in and probably would have missed out on gains.

I definitely had some sleepless nights where all I could think about was how much money I was ""losing"", but I knew eventually things would be back to normal.

By staying in, I was able to take advantage of one of the biggest market winning streaks in years.

That only worked for me because I didn't need the money immediately.  It's my investment for retirement and not for my daily expenses.  If you need that 5k to pay rent or buy groceries or whatever, maybe having it in the market isn't the best bet.

If you have some investments you're not really feeling, then now might be the time to sell them and invest in something else.  I wouldn't sell and go to cash though.

Amazingly, over 7 years later the stock is trading lower than where I bought it all those years ago. TWTR has never paid a dividend or split their stock, so in effect they've created zero wealth for the general public over their entire public existence. I sold my shares for a wash in 2014, but I'd have been shocked to hear they'd still be kicking around the same spot in 2021. In an era of social media, digital advertising and general tech dominance, it's a remarkable failure.

**TL;DR – Some brokers are taking their sweet time with these shares. MOST companies are down day after a merger and then rebound in the coming weeks. Sit tight!**

Ok, so we’ve all figured out what happens to our APHA and TLRY shares now that the merger is closed (Right? Right!). If you’re still confused, check out [THIS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphria/comments/n3uylv/still_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_your_apha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from earlier. 

Feedback on my prior post is that SOME brokers have changed your position to reflect your TLRY shares (TD Ameritrade for the win) and some have not (get your shit together, RH). Either way, you will get those shares (hopefully) soon and all will be well with the world.

BUT WAIT! TLRY is down $1.20 today… WTF?!? 

A few things to note - There are a lot of market dynamics at play here:

1. There were hedge funds with prior positions that now need to rebalance. 

2. There are people who were only holding on the APHA for the merger and now want to sell.

3. There are ETFs that will likely have some sort of rebalancing.

4. Shorts may be covering on the weakness today.

5. This is a liquidity event – expect volatility.

We can expect a decent amount of choppiness around TLRY the next few days. “But grey\_patagonia\_vest how do you know?!?” Well kids, I did some good old fashion data analysis. 

I pulled a list of all mergers with the following criteria:

1. Both target and acquirer are publicly traded on a North American exchange

2. The deal terms (like APHA/TLRY) were either all stock or at least some cash and some stonks

3. Any mergers with an equity value >$500mm USD (some of the smaller ones can get funky)

I then looked at the performance of the acquirer (like TLRY in this case) – after the deal closed. I started with the stock price of the acquirer 30 trading days before the merger closed, then looked at 7 days before, one day before, one day after, one week after, one month after, three months after, six months after and finally a year after. Here is what I found…. 

Of the 214 deals that fit this criteria… \~56% of acquirer stocks were down the day after a merger closed (as measured from the day before), so TLRY is in good company. Of these 56%, the companies were down an AVERAGE of 3% (TLRY currently down \~6%). Then, of those companies that were down on day one, 19% of them were back up after a week, 38% after a month and 48% after 3M. Those 48% that were up after 3M were up an average of 14% from the day before the merger. If TLRY behaved that way, we’d see TLRY @ $20.90 before long. 

What does this mean for TLRY? It takes some time. This is no guarantee and this definitely isn’t financial advice, but **today’s trading likely isn’t an indicator of future performance.**",['MMM']

I was able to make 20% off GME but that was canceled out and then some by the losses from all the others.

Update: Thanks for the suggestions. After thinking things over and reflecting on the points you’ve made, I’ve decided to sell ARKK and reinvest into my index portfolio.

 These swaps were kept off Archegos books (so they could manipulate shares in a stealth fashion).  The swaps were ""invisible"" to the investing public.

The stocks were purchased by Credit Swiss, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. Next sold back a ""derivative"" swap product to Archegos. This process hide the fact Archegos was pumping the market.

This was fraud. It allowed Archegos to keep buying shares of CBS, Discovery, etc. through the use of derivatives by driving up the price of these shares (because he was the only one buying them in the first place).

It was a classic pump and pump using an exotic financial product. The problem arose  when CBS saw the share prices going up so the decided to ""take advantage"" of the rising stock price by issuing new shares to take in revenue.

This new issuance of shares by CBS devalued the share price. As the shares started to plummet (because of the new issuance of stock) Archegos who was leveraged on both the stock and derivatives ""swaps"" started to be in the red real fast. 

The banks got scared because they were the ones who sold Archegos these swaps to begin with (and in order to cover their pussy asses) they involuntarily started to liquidate Archegos positions.

Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

n49ne9,,stocks,post,1620082056,"What’s your emerging markets play?As many of us may know, many emerging market were growing fast Pre-COVID. With a post-COVID recovery, some may experience the supercharged growth in the 2010s.

PWC released an excellent report a few years back detailing the expected economic size of countries by 2030 and 2050. India, China, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico were some noticeable growers in the top 10 by 2050. Other countries like Vietnam, Philippines, Egypt, and Nigeria were expected to grow very substantially as well.

Do you have any plans or plays to capitalize on new emerging markets in your portfolio?

My most direct plays are Unilever and TLK (Indonesia Telekom). UL has really positioned itself well in Southeast Asia and Latin America, reaping good results from consumers there. It could be a slight edge over their main competitor P&G in the decades to come. 

As for TLK, there is nothing particularly remarkable about it other than its large and established in one of the world’s largest growing economies. It’s solid, stable, and pays a nice dividend. If Indonesia stays stable, it should logically grow with the economy.

These are what I like and are not recommendations. 

Curious to hear your plays. 

As a note, focusing on emerging markets does have risk. Sometimes you are dealing with environments with poor rule of law, corruption or instability. Sometimes currency fluctuations can negatively impact your price. Be smart and be aware of your investing environment.",

Guns and ammo sales typically do better in the face of fear of the government moving significantly down the gun control path. 

Right now is something different, and 1/6 was a preview. There’s more to it - the firmly conservative Supreme Court and razor majorities in Congress mean sweeping gun control on the level that could meaningfully impact the industry has a near-zero percent chance of taking root. Gun control advocates have already been let down repeatedly in the first 100 days of the new government. 

And in any sort of “hits the fan” scenario, ammo is a more valuable currency than just about anything other than clean water. Doomsday preppers are on a different level right now, and they’re moving in larger packs.

n3uzfe,,stocks,post,1620045628,"Want to know what's happening with APHA & TLRY today? Read this!Today APHA & TLRY [announced](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-aphria-announce-closing-transaction-creates-new-tilray) that the merger is officially closed. Yay! Ok, but what does this mean for my stock??

**If you were a holder of APHA** shares as of 4/30/21 (Friday), each of your APHA shares will turn into 0.8381 shares of TLRY. This means that if you had 100 APHA shares, you will now have 83.81 shares of TLRY. **Keep in mind there are NO fractional shares.** This means that if your shares come out to 83.81, you will only receive 83 shares of TLRY. That number is always rounded DOWN, not up and there will be NO CASH to compensate you for your fractional share (so you can lose at most 0.99 shares of TLRY depending on how much APHA you have - which is like \~$18.56 (if TLRY is at $18.75))

**If you were a holder of TLRY shares** you are STILL a holder of TLRY shares. Nothing changes for you. In the announcement, the company mentions the TSX listing, but this is a [DUAL LISTING](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duallisting.asp). TLRY will continue to trade on NASDAQ. TLRY will ALSO trade under the symbol ""TLRY"" on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) starting May 5th. Really nothing for you to do here, just gives you the ability to trade them on either exchange - it provides extra liquidity.

Another thing to keep in mind is the ""back office"" - this happens at big banks and at big hedge funds too. APHA has HALTED today and will no longer trade. TECHNICALLY you now own TLRY shares that were given to you in the merger. When those show up in your account and you have the ability to freely trade those depends on what broker you use. If you're worried about it - call them. If you want to buy TLRY today, you can. Just go buy more and then the APHA shares that converted to TLRY will be added to your position when everything settles with your broker.","['IR', 'NDAQ']"

n42k48,,stocks,post,1620064339,"DD (Coupang - The Korean e-commerce Giant)This post will be about the DD I did on Coupang at the end of March. Although the stock has dropped slightly since then and have mostly been trading sideways, I thought I would share my thoughts about this company before they report earnings on May 12.

 

\- **Coupang** ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): 쿠팡) is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It is incorporated in [Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupang#cite_note-2)

\- Coupang is founded by South Korean businessman Bom Kim who dropped out of Harvard Business School after 6 months.

\- Currently Coupang is the largest e-commerce company in South Korea

&#x200B;

 **Business Model** 

 \- “We are building the future of commerce” -- Coupang S-1

\- A key competitive advantage of Coupang is what they call their ”Rocket Delivery Service”

\- This includes their Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Arriving before 7am if ordered before midnight or later in the day if ordered in the morning (this makes purchasing perishable items such as produce convenient).

\- They promise next-day or faster delivery on nearly 100 percent of orders.

\- Coupang claims that 70 percent of the South Korean population lives within 7 miles of a Coupon Logistics Center

&#x200B;

 **Opportunity** 

 

**- Korean Attractive Commerce Market**

Korea is the fourth largest economy in Asia. In addition, South Korea has the following key traits:

* High Mobile Penetration
* Retail Competitive Landscape
* Lifestyle

**- Coupang has an extremely integrated model. From the technology to the distribution**

&#x200B;

 **Risk** 

 

* Operation results might fluctuate significantly
* Future growth rate is hard to predict as the company aims to forgo short-term profitability for long-term growth
* If the company loses its senior executive members, it might not be able to fulfill its current vision.
* The company has had multiple years of large losses.

 

**Financials** 

 

* Total Net Revenue: 11.967 billion dollars (2020)
* Cost of sales: 9.98 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating, general, and administrative expenses: 2.51 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating loss: 527 million dollars (2020)
* Cash and Cash equivalents: 1.25 billion dollars (2020)
* Long-Term Debt: 353 million dollars (2020)
* Total Liabilities: 5.67 billion dollars (2020)

 **IPO** 

 

* Coupang went public earlier this month offering 130 million shares at $35 each, giving the company $4.55 billion 
* The stock closed at $49.25 on its first day.
* Coupang closed at $48.75 today (March 30, 2021). \*41.90 at end of April 30th

 **Valuation** 

 

\- 2020 total net revenue was 12 billion, assuming growth of 100 percent, the 2021 total net revenue would be 24 billion.

\- Using a forward P/S ratio of 5, we get the valuation of 120  billion dollars. Divided by 1.54 billion outstanding shares I get a 12-month price target of **77.922  dollars.**

**- This represents a 60 percent increase from the closing share price today.**

&#x200B;

 **Why We Should Invest in Coupang** 

 

* Household name: There are almost nobody in South Korea now who has not heard of Coupang before. Their status in South Korea is similar to that of Amazon in the US.
* Overseas Expansion: Coupang can achieve such a high-level of revenue and revenue growth without even entering foreign markets. Entering other Asian markets could potentially increase revenue by an even larger percentage
* Rapidly decreasing operating losses. While still not profitable, profitability is definitely achievable within a few years.
* Less political uncertainty: With US-China tensions rising, Coupang is a safe alternative for those who want to invest in Asia.

Apparently, [Fidelity's Fully Paid Lending Program ](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending) provides you with the opportunity to lend securities in your portfolio and earn income. If there is demand in the securities lending market, generally due to short selling, scarce lending supply, or corporate events, Fidelity may borrow certain eligible securities until either you or Fidelity elect to close the loan.


The biggest so far is that Shares on loan are not covered under Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). However, Fidelity provides collateral at a minimum of 100% of the loan value. In any securities lending transaction, counterparty default is a risk.",

One way to check if it'll be worth your while, is to fire up a trade ticket to short your own holdings.  If you don't see a borrow rate charged to short the stock, you won't be earning any interest.

To clarify, I live on my own at the moment and save quite a lot of my income (€1000 per month , about 50% of my income), which I all invest in the ETF. I am going to buy a house with my significant other which I think will lower my savings to €500 per month tops. I’m planning to move on with investing the same way as I am doing now.

**Week of 5/3/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.

Manufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit & factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity & labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings.

The average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM.

Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...”

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Let me tell ya I have been doing this for about 5 years now, and almost every time I got bored, said fuck it and sold, within a month or two the stock in question recovered and reached new highs.

I bought TGT at slightly above a $100 watched with horror as is dipped for several month on end, I sold it, and now a year later is at $211 

I refused to by Amazon when it was rising everyday to reach almost $3000, waiting for a dip, then finally I got it at a little below $3000, sat on it for a a couple of month not seeing any recovery or action, sold as soon as it crossed $3000, missing a potential $400 if I had waited. There was a conversation here recently where people was bashing Amazon and calling it a lost cause just before it goes up again, lol. 

Worst move, I was a believer in Tesla very early on, I held the bag forever when it was $300 pre split. Sold right before the earning report because it always dipped when they announced losses, that was the earning report where they had the surprise win, by next day the stock was  $400, I said I will just wait for it to come back, it went up to $1000, Eder up buying the same number of stocks I sold at $200 for close to a $1000 each.

Mine would be:

Tesla - Perhaps a little overpriced here, but from what I've seen, demand for Tesla cars are through the roof. The model 3 was the best selling car of that type in Q1 on the globe.

I also think Tesla's energy side of things doesn't get much attention. In my opinion, the vehicles are just an initial revenue line to build the brand. The energy is where the 2T+ market cap will come from. 

Robotaxis is also a very interesting proposition. If Tesla gets that nailed down, I can't see Uber and Lyft being in the market much longer. 

Skillz - mobile gaming is growing rapidly and will eclipse consoles within a few years imo. The traditional ad based model of games is becoming outdated. Skillz allows gamers to compete with eachother for cash (in $1, $5, $10, $20) in head to head games. This is far more engaging than traditional game models. 

They also have an anti-cheat system in place to ensure all games are fair.

When SPY first came on the scene in 1993, it was priced around $44 (from what I’ve researched). My question is, how did that number come to be?

I’ve been doing a bit of research into ETF pricing. I understand that ETF prices are determined by their daily NAV (unless I’m mistaken here), but how does the initial figure get decided on? Because an ETF float isn’t capped per se, I’m finding it hard to understand versus a regular stock.

As a sidebar, I’d also love to know how/if this is different to actively managed ETFs like ARKK, for example. How did they set their initial price of around $20 and how does the price get influenced day to day?

Thanks in advance!",['ARKK']

After that, the value is a combination of expenses and changing value of the assets. More investment in the fund leads to buying more assets and vice versa.

There is always some noise in the market price, but if the fund owns publicly traded/liquid accets, it doesn't make much sense to value the fund at anything other than the combined value of those assets.

The difference between passive and active funds is just strategy. Passive funds generally have low fees, and over time that effect accumulates, so it can be significant. That's why an active fund has to beat the market/index to get ahead. Often they don't.",

Fred further noted that “the AMMO management team viewed the Transaction as accretive to our shareholders when we announced the letter of intent. With the Transaction successfully closed, our team has reached another vertical integration milestone for the Company, representing an opportunity to diversify our revenue base with high profit-margin business offered through a premier brand deploying best-in-class secure transactional technology.”

Steve Urvan commented: “I am excited we have closed the Transaction so I can take my seat on the Board of this dynamic and growing company. I am confident our newly expanded AMMO team will bring innovative products and solutions for our expanding and loyal customer base. The GunBroker.com marketplace is going to enjoy the new shopping opportunities that serve the firearms, ammunition and accessory outdoor and shooting sports markets as we roll them onto the platform.”

In short, her situation is as follows:  


\- House paid off with no mortgage

\- Decent pension, pays all her monthly/annual bills, with enough spare for a couple of holidays a year and is able to save for the less frequent expenses, eg a new car when needed.

\- No debt other than a monthly CC used and paid off monthly

\- Circa 40k sitting the the bank doing nowt

This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?  If its entire attraction is its insane volatility how is it useful for its primary purported utility—currency—when it lacks the things a currency must have, namely stable store of value and standard of value (you're going to convert it back into a government backed security at some point)?",

n4ulww,gwxopzz,investing,comment,1620154993,"TL;DR - Neither...

Few things - a stock can only drop 100% (means it goes to zero) second of all... if a stock drops 50%, then goes up 50% you’re still not where you started! Third of all (thirdly?) averaging down doesn’t eliminate your losses and you’re assuming it WILL go back up but it doesn’t sound like you have a ton of conviction in the name. Ill-advised to double down in something you don’t like just because you’re in the red. 

My advice: ask your friend why they like the stock - do your own research - don’t believe in it? Cut it. Like the stock? Hold or average down. If you don’t like it and you sell for a loss you can also write that off against other gains on your taxes (not financial/tax advice).",

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4wqtd,,investing,post,1620158630,"Checking my understanding of why the market portfolio is the tangency portfolio, and why market-cap-weighting is correct under MPT / CAPMAssumptions:

* There is one intergalactic market that contains *everything* of value
* The market includes a risk-free asset (though I don't believe this is truly a requirement for this conclusion)
* I can buy an infinitesimal amount of anything and everything in the market
* Everyone knows everything about everything in the market, and they've traded with such liquidity that the value of everything in the market has been determined exactly
* The market portfolio is the sum of everything in the market
* We're in a frictionless vacuum, and cows are spherical

Then, the market portfolio is the best mean/variance portfolio: if a higher Sharpe ratio portfolio existed, then *everyone* would recognize this and use it, changing the prices in the market, making the portfolio worse than or equivalent to the market portfolio.

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?

n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['INTC', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'IP']"

However most etfs are priced higher than $60. The reason I have seen in the past is lower bid/ask.

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

n3tkix,,investing,post,1620040800,"Bullish or bearish on China / FLCH?I own some FLCH, which has some 900 holdings and a quarter of the ETF is Alibaba and Tencent, however the ETF value has been stagnating. I am considering liquidating and putting my money into VTI to ride thIs wave. But this is my dilemma:

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful. I obviously regret not putting that money into VTI as my logic (at the time) was that the global recovery will be lead by China:,and since China is the biggest trading partner for some 130+ countries, the ETF will recover nicely.

Now, with political tensions (delisting included) and increasing risks of a new cold war, I'm thinking it may stagnate for the next year or so while VTI climbs. But knowing my luck I suspect that if I do so, VTI will then slow down (stimuli already priced-in) and FLCH will take off. 

Any thoughts?",

n3jkda,,investing,post,1620000972,"Retail Dragon Portfolio - Week 1 UpdateFirst weekly update on the Retail Dragon Portfolio. A new screenshot can be found [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jSahhfA).

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Chris Cole's Dragon Portfolio Allocations](https://imgur.com/gallery/0JVrDkm)
* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI']

The next supply squeeze that may take markets by surprise isn’t lithium. It isn’t even a battery metal …

While everyone is distracted by the media barrage surrounding EVs, another commodity may be creating an investment opportunity to rival all …

We think it’s potentially bigger than the cannabis boom that reportedly netted some investors 1,000% gains.

It’s helium.

And some experts say we’re running out of it.

It’s not just a niche commodity anymore. It’s not just about balloons. And we think it’s positioned to become the focus of increased investor interest.  

Like oil and gas, this is about exploration, discovery, and development. And we think the biggest returns may end up coming from the small-cap explorers trying to hit the big time with a new discovery - all on their own.

*Growing Helium Demand*

Demand for helium is increasing, and it’s coming from multiple sectors, including everything from the tech and biomedical industries, to space, medical equipment and national security. And, yes, of course, party balloons and Thanksgiving Day parades.

Many industries require helium.

It’s been reported that the tech industry has been a massive catalyst, and that 2013 was a game-changing year for helium supply.

That’s when the world’s first ‘helium drives’ were made commercially available, making helium a key ingredient to fill our monstrous appetite for data.

Some 3.7 billion people are generating some 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. And even those numbers may grow by up to 60% a year. By 2025, it is projected to be more like 160 zettabytes per year. Helium drives were apparently a breakthrough that replaced the air in hard drives with helium to reduce the energy used. They went from concept to commercialization in 2013.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)--all are said to need tons of it for their massive data centers.

We think demand is set to surge into the helium-driven territory of zettabytes.

And the growing semiconductor market may depend on helium, too. Why? Because helium can bring temperatures down to below -450 degrees Fahrenheit--lower even than liquid nitrogen. This is important for superconducting equipment in particle accelerators and the magnets used to build semiconductors, according to Forbes.

Driving this further is a global computer chip shortage.

In Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Haldron Collider (LHC), the largest high-energy particle accelerator on Earth--and the biggest machine in the world, needs a truckload of helium every week.

Nor does the demand story end there …

The health sector is another major driver of helium demand. It’s also critical for use in cooling magnets in MRI machines. Without helium, we won’t have working MRIs. The shortage also threatens NMRs--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which in turn is a crucial aspect of medical research.

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

n44y45,gwtm292,investing,comment,1620071767,"There's a lot of regulatory / political uncertainty surrounding GEO and the prison space right now. The Biden executive order has directed the DOJ to cease use of private facilities which is acting as a headwind to revenue and contract renewal rates. Losing the Bureau of Prison business via the executive order isn't that big of a deal, but it does represent ~$290MM of revenue rolling off between now and FYE2022. More concerning, however, was having the contract with the US Marshals canceled at the GEO Queens facility as this customer was viewed as far more sticky than the BOP. Losing the BOP revenue was always a matter of ""when"", not ""if"", but potentially losing the USMS in addition means GEO investors need to diligence how the company will navigate losing two of its top three customers.

Increasing chatter of reform at ICE layers in additional concerns as this is their largest customer, though it isn't clear to me how the USMS and ICE will rapidly move away from the industry with any degree of efficiency, particularly as COVID impacts on prison and ICE populations abate. While the asset value at GEO is robust, keep in mind there is limited use for these assets. A prison can't be converted into a shopping mall or a bowling alley, for example, and at GEO you have a lot of debt ahead the equity that would be paid out first in the event of a liquidation. While it likely makes sense for the government to solve the prison prison ""problem"" by buying these assets for public use given the constraints in the government prison system, for political reasons this may not happen.

Add on top of all of this is GEO's limited ability to tap capital markets due to ESG concerns (though this is a constantly moving line) + GEO's 2024 maturity wall and it doesn't strike me as a great equity story. Limited paths for growth, regulatory concerns, questionable access to capital, refi risk, etc, etc. Eliminating the dividend was a good first step but long over due. Given yield on GEO's debt I would prefer to buy the near term bonds than the equity.

Personally I like CoreCivic better than GEO. Less leverage, better story, less BOP risk, but neither strikes me as a compelling equity opportunity.

TLDR: tough equity story; this is not a ""down the fairway"" stock as it is borderline distressed; lots of revenue is rolling off and even more is at risk of rolling off in the future rendering current P/E metrics rather useless; limited opportunities for growth in general as prison populations have been in decline for years now",['ICE']

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile. 

Is it not commonplace to view growth stocks as more volatile than value? Was this view different 15 years ago?",['BLL']

However, I’m not even sure your statement holds today, as we can easily flip it. We say we view growth as more risky, but how many people are throwing large investments into renewables or EVs?  The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth. 

People tend to extrapolate recent past performance into the future and view recent decline to indicate continuing decline and recent success to indicate continuing success.",

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

Why not!? If you think inflation is going to keep climbing I don't see how the 30 year yield can remain low. 3% doesn't even represent a normal level of term spread even at low inflation levels. If inflation remains stable or continues to increase the 30 year yield has to continue going up just to maintain a positive expected return much less keep up with historical term spread.",

Well Powell keeps saying transitory rather than temporary because temporary implies it does away. Transitory means it is a one time bump. Once inflated the Fed and the treasury do not expect a decline in prices but lower future inflation.

I've been in gold and silver since last spring/summer. I don't think it will rise that much due to alternatives like crypto (which I sadly did not buy into last spring/summer), the strength of equities, and how bullish economies coming out of a recession tend for boom industrial materials/metals rather than defensive ones like silver/gold. Not saying it can't rise on inflation, but gold/silver are highly speculative so a strong global economy could offset the inflationary gains of precious metals.",

Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['TSLA', 'DOW', 'SPGI', 'TWTR']"

n2uok0,,investing,post,1619913292,"İnflation nothing changedNothing has changed over the past week. The Fed remains dovish, and in spite of its transitory speak about inflation, prices continue to soar. Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

I wish I had more to say , but who wants to hear a running post on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, and given the long slow grind lower following the slingshot to 2100 in Goldand 40 silver , I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

This is why they are leading with mustangs/trucks and not Lincoln, honestly, when was the last time you saw someone under 50 willingly drive a Lincoln? The branding isn’t there.

Also Michigan is a right-to-work state and union membership has been declining because of this in recent years (or in this case, growing at a slower rate than the size of the auto industry). Some of the points you made are valid, but electrifying their truck line is a no-brainer when they were humiliated by Tesla's Cybertruck in a towing demonstration. (Argue about the validity of the Cybertruck vs F150 test until the cows come home, it was still an effective piece of marketing).

* Shares: $18.58
* PEG: 0.01

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

Invest at your own risk. The above scenario is incredibly risky and a slight deviation in your math will bankrupt your account, but if correct, it’s a big payday and scaleable with a ton of margin if you choose that risk.",
n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA. Ironically this probably sets up a good entry to short bubble stocks, of which there are plenty. Be careful of ones with weekly expiries and high short interest; these are prone to gamma manipulation by larger players. It's a game and if there is money to be made in a short squeeze it will be done. 

There is stuff like ARKK which doesn't necessarily have 0 fundamentals but has very high valuations; SPACs which are mostly frauds (e.g. NKLA), meme stocks like MVIS and GME. Go for put spreads instead of outright shorting if you can find a good entry. 

You could go for a more balanced approach and diversify your short book. Solely from valuation you can short MSFT/APPL against long GOOG/FB and I reckon there are many more interesting pairs out there. But there is so much money on the table if the bubble stocks do burst. The call-buying from retail is slowly diminishing as the economy is reopening up; interest rates are rising and I think this is probably a good opportunity to set up some shorts if you can stomach large drawdowns (and you do need conviction to believe that stocks will trade towards their fair value over time).","['TSLA', 'MSFT', 'ARKK', 'FB']"

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']"

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",

It’s commercial uses include Cloud computing, Data Centres, Semiconductors, MRI scans, space, satellites, military rockets and quantum computing. 
It has the lowest boiling point of of any element and can therefore be used to keep freeze things at sub zero temperatures like vaccines. 

Helium One Globals: Project Rukwa drilling is due to start in May, this is the largest known primary helium resource in the world. It is a pure or carbon neutral helium field, promising a green, clean, carbon neutral form of gas. Their site is 138 BILLION cubic feet ( or put another way enough for 20 years global supply). The is already a pent up demand due to its multiple uses, and the price of helium has recently increased from $118 mcf in 2018 to $280 mcf in 2020

The current way helium is gained is as a by- product of oil and hydrocarbon refining and It is currently the only listed company in the UK that offers exposure to primary source helium exploration, whilst the US nears the end of a 25 year privatisation program.

Abundant, Valuable, Multi purpose, with a pent up demand, limited supply, ESG credentials and drilling to start in May.

n13d9f,,investing,post,1619699725,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval ProcessWelcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

This is a general overview of the FDA drug approval process. I hope this has been informative to some and if so, I may try to write some more quick guides in the future regarding pharmaceuticals.",['DISH']

n0k1xc,,investing,post,1619630884,"Why REITs Are in a position to outperform equities on a risk-adjusted basis1. The corporate tax hike will affect most corporations, but REITs are ""pass through"", so they will be unaffected by this as they do not pay corporate taxes.

2. The capital gains and qualified dividend tax hike won't affect REITs either, because they're already taxed as ordinary income(other than QBI deduction)

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

4. Real estate has historically done well during periods of inflation, and many leading indicators for inflation are present(High commodity prices, shortages, high demand, stimulus, M2 growth, unemployment dropping, rising inflation expectations)

5. REITs have yet to recover as much in share price as much as the equity market. While equities are trading at far higher P/E ratios than they were a year ago, REITs FFO to price ratios are still looking cheap.

6. If you look at 1999 when equities were starting to trade at similar P/E Ratios, REITs went on to perform well during the tech bubble crash up until the real estate bubble several years later.

7. Low interest rates present an opportunity for leveraged investment",

n10ce9,gwayduw,investing,comment,1619708893,"Why would anybody invest in bonds or international?

I totally get the instinct to diversify.  But I feel the push to invest in bonds is based on bond yields that simply don’t exist anymore. If bond yields were at historical
Averages I’d be 60:40. But bond yields have been trash for years. Prices have been meh. With international I get the fomo and diversification, but typically broad international markets seem to move in concert (correlate with) with SPY (at least over time), but at a lower rate or return. I was on bogleheads for a while and there seemed blind adherence to some mix of bonds and international. I don’t get it. When I backrest that strategy there are no ten year periods that beat VTSAX. I’m open to discussion and wonder why index investors don’t all just go US. Thoughts?",

n1awok,,investing,post,1619721222,"Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings Apple is a great long term buy according to my opinion. My Portfolio is 100% Apple. I believe this company has so many more avenues to venture into and maintain healthy growth over the following decade. I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",['AAPL']

>I'm not going to post specific, in depth TA or research into any particular stocks

But this is the best and most important part? If you don't want to get into your DD then how about amusing me a bit with these questions:

* How do feel about the risk of weak returns since Brazil has been in a decade of economic down turn? Historically Brazil has had booms that market them look like they'll reach developed status only to bust back into developing status.

* Have you factored in the problems with inflation and continued currency weakness? US might be printing like crazy, but LatAm currencies are experiencing inflation not only against their own goods/services but also against the dollar.

* Are you factoring the various troubles of Bolsonaro government having immediate and long term impacts?

* How are you so sure those individual stocks will do so well? Investing in Brazil is already risky as is with it likely being outside the circle of competence of most people. The added individual stock picks only increases those risks. Why not invest in an ETF like EWZ?

* What makes you think that these Brazilian stocks or even a Brazilian ETF can outperform US stocks when historically speaking the US & S&P has beaten Brazil and the Brazilian top stocks in basically every time range be it 1yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, or 50yr?

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”","['DOV', 'TEL', 'SNA', 'PEP', 'DE', 'CE', 'WHR', 'KO']"

**Here is an advice, if you really want to grasp how persistent is inflation, you want to look at how high are the base effects,  companies can pass through the cost of higher inputs, what's the state of demand what is exactly pushing it and is it structural ?

To answer all of this questions reading articles or opinions you pulled of Google News won't cut it. You need to look at actual data, numbers in a spreadsheet or Refinitiv/Bloomberg terminal something that gives you a macro view of the economy.

In a very short time period there was a huge amount of negative press and sentiment from a historically bad launch, getting hacked, lawsuits, COVID, major hedge fund short interest - it's like the company got caught in a perfect storm of negativity. ""The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets"" has popped into my head a couple of times.

No idea what the stock will do in the short term. In the long term maybe Cyberpunk is less buggy/comes back to PS4, the Netflix show returns and generates interest, older games get ported to PS5, Witcher 4 media hype increases, etc.",['NFLX']

n0e7xt,gw7b01w,investing,comment,1619634823,"I am long CD Projekt Red. I used to work in the games industry, happy to share some thoughts:

* Great studios are very far and few. To develop something like the Witcher series and gain such widespread critical acclaim is not easy. It takes a lot of money, talent, and momentum to be able to build such competence as a developer, that's valuable.
* Essentially CD Projekt Red benefits from being HQ'd in Eastern Europe. These games require an army to develop. Well, eastern developers are a cheap and talented army.
* The games of today are services, they are not one-off products. Cyber Punk will be improved upon, and over time the developers will hash out all the bugs and the game will improve.
* The best time to release a new IP is during the release of a new generation of consoles. It matters less whether the game is any good, the key is to make the IP a thing (one game is not the IP). As far as I am concerned, every gamer has heard of this IP now. All it takes are some critical reviews of the next installments to completely change the media storyline.
* CD Projekt Red made all of Cyber Punk's development costs back before the game was even released in preorders. They are far from losing money at this point.",['IP']
n133p8,,investing,post,1619698785,"DD: Mother's Day is May 9th - Go Get Her Some Nice $FLWS1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March & September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA & ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

I’ve been holding a couple hundred shares of Alibaba for a little while and last night while I was browsing yahoo finance I noticed that the price target range had been lifted from $220-$350 to $1000-$2500 and almost had a heart attack from the excitement.

My wife and I have about 55K in a High Yield Savings Account, however with interest rates going down, the return has been pretty poor. Looking to move some of the money to some higher growth accounts. I also have about 45K in different ETFs and Stocks (Robhinhood & Stash...mostly tech, blue chip stock)

My wife and I both work full time. Combined annual income is around 200K.

We currently own a house and want to grow our money for savings/retirement. There is no plan for a big purchase, maybe a new house in a few years but likely would use the profits from our current house for a down payment. It really would just to be grow the money for retirement.

I don't mind being a risky, my wife is more conservative however. She thinks the $17 we get a month from our savings account is a big win. 

I currently max out my 401K and have about 80K in there right now. (Started a little late maxing it out)

I do not have an IRA . 

Don't have a ton of debt, maybe 1K on a credit card and I lease my car. My wife's car is paid off.

I just opened an E\*trade Core Portfolio account to transfer 15K of that 55K into it to hopefully grow. Should I go this route or are there better options to grow my money? If I invest it in an IRA can I take it out at any time or will I get taxed if I take it out before 59.5? My father passed away at 60 so I'd rather spend my money earlier in life.

mzn9py,,investing,post,1619526251,"What do you think broad market returns will average over the next 20 years?When retirement planning or just choosing between different investment opportunities we all have to make some assumptions about what the long-term broad market outlook is. With a difference of 2% growth rates over the next 20 years there can be massive differences in the end value of your investment.


The historical CAGR (with dividends) of the S&P500 over the last X years (ending Dec 31 2020) is as follows:

100 Years: 10.46%

90: 9.92%

80: 11.23%

70: 11.54%

60: 10.27%

50: 10.76%

40: 12.01%

30: 10.24%

20: 6.59%

10: 13.99%

Source: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm


Knowing this, what do you assume the broad market will have for an annualized growth rate over the next 20 years or so? I'm thinking along the lines of the total S&P500 return, VTSAX, or similar. Why?


I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more. Second, I think macroeconomic headwinds are coming compared to the previous decades that will result in slower overall growth.",['SPGI']
mzn9py,gw2hafy,investing,comment,1619541843,"For what it's worth, despite many on Reddit saying it would be a wild guess, the idea of forecasting returns within a rough degree of accuracy is pretty well accepted in mainstream finance.  After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

There's a bunch more, obviously, but those are some highlights.  I would encourage anyone who genuinely wants to absorb some information to read the [full report](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/ltcma-full-report.pdf).  It's a bit long, but it's full of fantastic insights.

E: it should be noted that JPM isn't the only institution doing this - most banks release similar reports, even the fan favorite Vanguard has long term market assumptions that largely reflect these, and so did Jack Bogle before his passing.  The reason I mention it is to note that the idea of return forecasting isn't some sort of crazy complex finance marketing - it's just an execution of some basic macroeconomics and math.",['JPM']

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -> Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -> Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-> Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-> Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook & Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

Is this realistic to attempt a valuation going backwards on Price/Sale ratio?

Nobody uses sales or revenue to determine price because of all the accounting sleight of hand that affects these figures.  This is why operating cash flow is central to securities pricing.

Operating income has been negative for five straight years.  Operating cash flow has been negative for four of the last five years.

An S&P 500 Index Fund, for example: SPY, or a property in San Francisco: lets assume average price across the whole city over the same time frame.

If two identical people had taken all of their disposable income and savings and one put it into SF property and the other SPY, who would have come out ahead?

For the sake of concreteness, lets say the one investing in SF Real Estate lived in the house, whereas the one investing in SPY paid an equal amount of rent to the Mortgage of the SF property, but without Property taxes.

To be clear, this is not asking what a viable investment strategy is, or if it's smart to invest like in the examples above.

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this? 

I don't wanna seem conspiratorial but it'd seem that most institutional investors have a vested interest in holding GE. 

More worryingly, the only coverage about the aftermath I can find, seems to be taken down: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-25/it-s-almost-like-the-shock-ge-short-thesis-never-happened

mz77xi,,investing,post,1619469066,"New guidelines for DD posts**This is a follow up to /u/Greytoc's post here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mw4jei/psa_stock_promotion_and_suspicious_stock/

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.     

Unrelated: We've eased up the automod constraints on advice/beginner posts to hopefully encourage more complex questions to come through.",

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR']

From the perspective of somebody that actually holds crypto in a wallet, not one that just speculates on it on robinhood, how would everything you hold and every transaction you ever make be in any way beneficial? Transparent blockchains are good for validation systems, but they are the worst possible thing that can be applied to any form of currency if you want to maintain any level of privacy whatsoever. This is only a benefit if you are speculating on movements of whales and is absolutely not good if you realize that your movement can be tracked in real time too...",
mym30u,,investing,post,1619398871,"CVS bought out Aetna without issuing stocks?  

Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Aetna common stock is being exchanged for $145.00 in cash and ***0.8378 shares of CVS*** Health common stock.  CVS Health is not issuing any fractional shares in the transaction. Instead, the total number of shares of CVS Health common stock that each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive is being rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive cash for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that the Aetna shareholder is otherwise entitled to receive.

The transaction values Aetna at $212 per share or approximately $70 billion. Including the assumption of Aetna’s debt, the total value of the transaction is $78 billion. The combined company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CVS.” The Aetna brand name will continue to be used in reference to the health insurance products. Going forward, Aetna will operate as a standalone business within the CVS Health enterprise and will be led by members of its current management team.

It says it did not issue any fractional shares, but how was shareholders of Aetna given 0.8378 share of CVS? where did the share come from?",['CVS']

my953u,,investing,post,1619360105,"Feedback post: we're considering revising/specifying the rules on advice/spitball postsThe moderation pendulum swings all over the place, but I fear it's a bit too far on constricting right now.  We haven't actually changed any of our base rules, but have tightened up on some in the post GME deluge of dumb posts. 

I know /u/greytoc just made a post on DD guidelines, we're just about ready to roll out some new firm guidelines on what DD is appropriate and what is not.  So stay tuned for that.  

So, that said the volume of posts has decreased significantly here, a lot are being removed for very good reasons, but we're still thinking of ways to strike a nice balance (to be clear - quality of discussion is and will continue to be our primary goal with any rule).  I regularly check the automod removal logs and 99% of the posts being removed are frankly just really generic advice requests or basic questions. 

That said, I'd like to formulate some formal guidelines for differentiating between a post that should be in a daily thread and one that can have it's own thread.  I'd like for sufficiently complex topics to be able to generate insightful discussion - this is an inherently subjective threshold so someone's gonna be mad about their post not making the cut, but I think formalizing some guidelines should help.  

So, I was discussing this with /u/Emc87, and our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here.  But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.  

This obviously creates a lot of room for interpretation - I've seen enough people in modmail arguing that ""how do I buy stock"" is a valid discussion topic that would help many people to know that we're not going to make everyone happy here.  But I would like to see what thoughts everyone has as to putting a semi-formal framework on these ideas, so that we can point to something when deciding which posts will be sent to the daily threads and which can have their own post.",['GOOGL']

Back to Employer Plan and max it out
Contribute to Taxable accounts

mym15t,gvxb4h5,investing,comment,1619442134,"The advice you've outlined is pretty common in /r/personalfinance which tends to be skewed to young, early career, or pre-career demographics or people working in a career with limited/stagnated earnings. Roth is a good option for these workers because they tend to be in lower tax brackets now, but with potential for higher income in the future and in retirement. Additionally, Roth IRA's allow removal of contributions (but not growth) without penalty which provides flexibility in how the money is used which younger workers value. 

If you're an older, professional, mid/late career worker, in a career where earnings tend to increase with experience and responsibility, you will tend to get more benefit from pre-tax account contributions. These workers tend to be in higher tax brackets and have income that exceeds their planned retirement income. These workers should prioritize 401k, HSA. Deductible IRA contributions generally are not an option due to the low income cap. 

The rule of thumb I've seen is that if you're in the bottom two tax brackets you should prioritize after-tax accounts (Roth, Roth 401k). If you're above the bottom two tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax (401k, HSA) and after maxing these, use Roth IRA, then taxable accounts.",

mydjye,gvxq9vn,investing,comment,1619449452,"Look, you are free to disregard this, but I'm hoping to save you a lot of pain.  For what it's worth, I'm currently the CEO of a biotech startup that's raised $30MM.

If you don't meet the accredited investor definition (by wealth, not certification) and you're not playing an active role in managing whatever you're looking at investing in, at least one of the following are true: you should not be investing in that business, and if that business is interested in having you as an investor, *nobody* should be investing in it.

The rules are there to protect investors who can't afford to lose significant amounts of money from high-risk, illiquid investments where there are significant information gaps between investors and management due to the lack of formal reporting.  It's not just that you're risking money that may disappear; it's that you're doing it without the ability to have the market setting the price, analysts reviewing financials, and real due diligence.

Moreover, the rules are there because, to have you as an investor, these companies need you to invest *a lot* *more* than you could lose comfortably if you don't meet the thresholds.  When I raised the seed into my current company, minimum investment was $50k.  I wanted a clean cap table with investors who wouldn't be pinched if it took a long time to get out (on average, that's 5-10 YEARS) and who knew what they were signing up for.  A company who is ok with someone investing $5k-$10k that isn't a founder and is marginally accredited either a) isn't raising enough money to scale; b) is going to have a very messy cap table; or c) is delusional or lying about capital needs or business potential.  Likely all three.

If you want to get involved with exciting startup investments, go be a part of an exciting startup.  Start one yourself, or find some founders and offer to help, or just get a job at a startup.  But if you're not accredited, you shouldn't be investing in these things -- the potential for loss is massive and you're not going to have enough firepower or financial ballast to make much of a difference or weather the rough times.",

mxaojd,,investing,post,1619230712,"The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail InvestorEDIT: I added the [MacroVoices podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDIifbY71g) where Chris Cole goes over the Dragon Portfolio. I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&P 500. This tends to outperform the S&P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.","['SPGI', 'LEG']"

mwvqvk,,investing,post,1619185962,"Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunityLeave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

This is my only mining stock and I am quite bullish on it, here's why.Solaris Inc., a COPPER and GOLD mining company (can't go wrong with these assets!) in the Americas, engages in acquiring, exploring, and evaluating mineral properties. Holds 100%  interest in the Warintza copper project located in the South-Eastern Ecuador; and 75% & 80% interest in the ongoing exploration of copper porphyry in Tamarugo and Ricardo(Chilean copper belt) respectively. The company is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.

According to the company’s official press release early this year ([link](https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-announces-new-discovery-at-warintza-west-geophysics-reveal-more-extensive-porphyry-system-doubling-drill-program-to-12-rigs)): ""Solaris is pleased to announce a significant new discovery in maiden drilling at Warintza West and the first detailed geophysical survey covering its Warintza Project (“Warintza” or “the Project”) have revealed a much more extensive porphyry system than previously understood.  To meet the increased scope of resource and discovery drilling, the Company is doubling its drill program from six to 12 rigs.”  
 A report from the [geophysical](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) investigation shows that  the copper in the ground is worth four or five billion and the market cap is only 1 billion.  
Moreover, Solaris acquisition has significantly been de-risked by being fully funded and availability of drilling resources, so there is no need to worry about capital of the project.  
   
You may also be concerned about the bottom line of the Warintza project after Ecuador’s new president elect; Guillermo Lasso’s government has [full support](https://www.northernminer.com/politics/miners-await-looming-presidential-elections-in-ecuador/1003828891/) of mining projects in the country as will greatly boost the country’s economy and not rely on oil alone.

I first became aware of them when I saw Mr. Li  Ka-Shing (the 29th richest man) invest $105M of a $305M round priced at a  25% premium to market. Since then I have seen 2 short reports come out  against the company and I can't seem to figure out why. Having watched  them do this raise, and complete the acquisition of CRH Medical and  today ExecHealth which will bring their revenue to $300M with $50M in  free cash flow with $0 debt and $80M left in the bank. I can't  understand why not one but two short reports against them have been  released…

Some reasons I am looking at them:

* \- Founded by a successful Entrepreneur who sold his previous company to PayPal for $304M
* \- Seed investor is the 29th richest man in the world and he has invested in every round since
* \-  Completed a $305M raise priced 25% above the market at the time which  again was led by the 29th richest man with over $100m of his own money
* \- CRH acquisition means they will have close to or over $300M in revenue and over $50M in free cash flow
* \-  $0 debt $80m in cash?
* \- Truly proving themselves to be a leader in what will be a $289B Telehealth market.

I am trying to understand how does a short squeeze work, in particular when a person shorts a stock but can't cover it when the stock prices goes up instead of going down. I still have a gap in my understanding and I thought you maybe able to help fill it.

I try to explain here:

Let's suppose we have:

1. `Person 1`
2. `Person 2`
3. `Person 3`
5. `Marker Maker`

And 10 shares of a given stock. Initially we have:

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 0      |
| `Person 2` | 0      |
| `Person 3` | 0      |
| `Market Maker` | 10 |

Then let's say `Person 1`, and `Person 2` buy 1 share each:

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 1      |
| `Person 2` | 1      |
| `Person 3` | 0      |
| `Market Maker` | 8  |

Then `Person 3` borrows 8 shares from the MM with the intention of shorting it:

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 1      |
| `Person 2` | 1      |
| `Person 3` | 8      |
| `Market Maker | 0  |

`Person 3` then sells those shares to `Person 1` and `Person 2` at the market price (4 shares to each):

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 5      |
| `Person 2` | 5      |
| `Person 3` | 0      |
| `Market Maker` | 0  |

Let's pretend that after sometime `Person 3` realizes that the share price will not go down and he gives up and decides to buy back the shares and return it to the Market Maker.

Irrespective of initial prices, borrow fees, etc. Let's say `Person 1` and `Person 2` only sell their shares for a certain price:

| Who?     | Price  |
|----------|--------|
| Person 1 | $420   |
| Person 2 | $69   |

Let's say `Person 3` only has $5 in his bank account. Does that mean, that the Market Maker liquidates `Person 3`, takes his $5, and then is obligated to buy the shares at
the prices set by `Person 1`, `Person 2`, with two $420 shares of `Person 1` remaining in his possession?",['GPS']

n4q4rc,,StockMarket,post,1620139641,"Do you believe the crypto market needs to be regulated?This is such a difficult question and it’d also be very difficult to regulate or even moderate any forms of *illegal* activity in the crypto market. One of the very few reasons why COIN IPO was approved in the first place was so that SEC can have greater access to the crypto market in attempts to regulate some of the trading activities. They want their hands on anything that’s considered to be a high-valued lucrative asset and why wouldn’t they?

But I would imagine trying to set rules in a place that’s complete out of their jurisdiction isn’t easy to do or even possible at all besides banning the trading of crypto XYZ on exchanges. Some cryptos that I assume SEC wants off their list are cryptos that possess similar attributes of DOGE and FULLSEND. Both of these currencies have no utility values besides sticking up a middle finger to the stock/bond market. Gunk that’s currently worth 60B isn’t probably something that SEC finds appealing nor acceptable when they ransack the entire NYSE, NASDAQ, OTCQX, OTCQB and PINK market every second to find any misinformation that brings a stock up 30% in value ensuing criminal charges.

Engaging in the trading of DOGE is pretty much playing hot potato at this point and it’s a surety that there’s some level of manipulation that’s led to the current prices because obviously, the fundamentals don’t justify it.

n4wx36,,StockMarket,post,1620159056,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Tuesday, May 4, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 4, 2021**

Stocks fell on Thursday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and  economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near-term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already-elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

n4wfiy,,StockMarket,post,1620157893,"Why You Should Short the Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['INTC', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'IP']"

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Everyone knows that companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook are turning to AR/VR. For instance, we have the Microsoft/MVIS “relationship”, Apple [smart glasses](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-glasses) coming, Google glasses having already been out, and Zuck spending **much** of his $5B R&D on AR/VR. As the sector grows, these mega-companies can either develop their own tech—and many will, in part—or acquire / partner with smaller players. Many will do that too. So the question is: which of these smaller companies do you believe in?

Many of you have recently been burnt by MVIS. It certainly had an appealing storyline, full of speculation, intrigue, and the promise of a trip to the moon. Maybe things will turn around.

They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin's growth potential.”

Essentially, Kopin competes in the same space as MVIS and VUZI. But they’re not exactly playing the same game.

**Tech**

First, KOPN’s tech and patents mentioned here are highly promising. I’ll talk a bit more about them, but feel free to check out this cool series of webinars [yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5E4WsPVOYY&feature=youtu.be). Another thing to do is read the linked article; Kopin recently shipped its first batch of OLED [microdisplays](https://www.oled-info.com/kopin-developeds-double-stack-oled-architecture-higher-brightness-oled). They have their own double-stack architecture which enhances battery life and image fidelity—two components that will be key for things like consumer electronics. I believe they will win in this space.

They also have a chip for voice activation called [Whisper](https://www.kopin.com/audio-solutions/), which they’ve filed over 20 patents for. They claim that “Whisper maintained an accuracy rate of 93 percent in a 95 dB noise environment, compared to competitive products, which maintained an accuracy rate of just 40 percent or less.” Given how people will want to use their smart glasses hands-free, this will be key. And based on the above quote, they will win here too.

Finally, it’s worth mentioning the company’s military connections. Many don’t realize this, but Kopin is the [largest](https://www.kopin.com/military-applications/) supplier of microdisplays for the U.S. military. Think things like thermal weapon sights, night vision goggles and pilot helmet mounted displays for F-35 fighter jets. This is quite a testimonial in my opinion; the military doesn’t play when it comes to technology…

All of this tech is protected via over 200 wearables-related patents, and 20 patents related to OLED. Their tech advantage is also reflected by their blue-chip customer base, which really speaks for itself:

I’d encourage any technical people to delve more into Kopin and their customers to really understand the power of their patents and product offering. Maybe leave a comment below!

**Financials**

For every bet, including “informed bets” like the stock market, there are two key components: the cost of the ticket and the payout potential. What I like about $KOPN is that you are paying *hugely* “less” to bet on the future of AR/VR (at least relative to competitors). Essentially, $KOPN is in a highly appealing financial position, with the potential for “hype”—which hasn’t really moved the stock as drastically—serving as a nice call option on the stock. First, check out the Kopin quarterly income statement:

https://preview.redd.it/lgodi0yaeww61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=478c34aa29ca6398ffce3570102f6e606108c81f

A few trends stick out. First, the company is steadily growing revenues, while maintaining a reasonable GPM. They are also increasing R&D spend, which is important for a company in a burgeoning and highly technological sector. But really, the most exciting trend is that of Operating Income margin, which has gone from negative to positive, along with EPS!

The company also posted $34.9 million in LTM revenue as of the last quarter. Compare this to MVIS, with $3 million over the same time frame. Now, it’s quite clear that this company presents *at least* an equally attractive financial situation as MVIS, by any standard definition.

Further, if this trajectory continues and other things hold, the company would continue to post positive EPS—which is something that competitors like VUZI or MVIS simply cannot claim. After the last earnings report, where Kopin flipped EPS positive, the stock reacted extremely well, shooting up over 20%. What will happen if they improve even further?

The company is also not likely, in my opinion, to undertake any significant dilutive actions, or to go bankrupt. This is because they have an attractive balance sheet with **no debt**. So let’s put it like this: you are getting positive EPS, with a good balance sheet, at an $875 million market cap. Compare this to MVIS at a $3.3 billion market cap, with negative EPS, or VUZI at a $1.5 billion market cap—and also with negative EPS! In my view, you “pay” much less to bet on AR/VR with KOPN.

So what do you *get* if you’re “paying less?”

**Catalysts**

First, you get access to a market growing at a rather nice CAGR. Since Kopin will be a major player in this market, you can simply check this estimation from the KOPN corporate presentation. Assuming KOPIN gets a mere 1% of this spend, they will be shockingly undervalued here.

https://preview.redd.it/dey6u3kieww61.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=add762fbaf92cf4bb5cd9cf01fffa23f2ee1f43d

But perhaps more excitingly, you get access to a near-term series of catalysts which could see the share price appreciate significantly. Here’s a potential timeline, which doesn’t include the potential for surprise events:

* **May 4th Earnings Call**
* May 12 Webinar II - Present AR / VR
* May 26 Webinar III - Future AR / VR
* June 6-7 Stifel Tech Conference
* June 7-9 Apple WorldWide Developers Conference

This presents numerous “shots on goal” for $KOPN.

Of course, ultimately the company’s fate depends on performance, because the ticker has traded largely without hype, at least when compared to MVIS or VUZI. Consider the following comparison of the three companies to get an idea how little followed and undervalued KOPN is. First, the MVIS financial “highlights”:

https://preview.redd.it/ll5yanrceww61.png?width=2210&format=png&auto=webp&s=1332365538f72d4032f63ad5cc06112d577b89aa

Now, VUZI:

https://preview.redd.it/o7qop3hdeww61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7c45622355639fe57d46c131c39c4b45539b12

A bit better than MVIS, but still…

And, finally, KOPN:

https://preview.redd.it/6c9f78ceeww61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=00bea97b3e6438e79fcfecfc4529168df40f4bc3

Now, I’m sure I’ll have a million of you reeeing out, telling me how I just don’t understand the tech, and tHat MVIS wIlL gO tO tHe mOOn. That’s fine. I’m not here to convince anyone. All I’m doing is suggesting that you, rubbing together your two brain cells, **look through the above and play spot the trend.** Then ask yourself: as this market grows, which of these companies do you believe in?

Personally, I believe in the recently newly profitable technology leader partnered with Lockheed Martin, FLIR, and Google.

n47l4z,,StockMarket,post,1620076590,"CLEU EDUCATIONAL SERVICES RESEARCH (FUNDAMENTALS AND TECHINICALS)Hi guys, look at this stock 

CLEU ( China Liberal Education Holdings Limited) is a company who provides educational online services on China. 

Strictly "" China Liberal Education Holdings Limited provides educational services and products under the China Liberal brand name in China. The company offers Sino-foreign jointly managed and delivered academic programs, including undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as diploma and non-degree higher education, and senior secondary education programs in the areas of languages, liberal arts, and businesses. It also provides overseas study consulting and technological consulting services for Chinese universities to enhance their campus information and data management system, as well as to optimize their teaching, operating, and management environment. The company's consulting services include campus intranet solution buildout, school management software customization, smart devices, installation and testing, and school management data collection and analysis. In addition, it develops and provides textbooks and other course materials to students enrolled under the Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs, as well as offers job readiness training to graduating students. China Liberal Education Holdings Limited was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Beijing, China""

The first thing that got my attention is the EXTREMELY low float of this company. There are just 5,37M outstanding shares from which 2,71M are floating. Market Cap is 5,37x3,8 = USD 20M and short interest is around 10%. (exactly 9,95%)

The first that came to my mind when I saw it was ""Meehh, this kind of features/patterns are tipical from a cash burning company (a company that lost money every quarter and allways need debt or that dilutes its shareholders every now and then in order to survive)""... But surprisingly it's not...

The company not only has an excellent revenue (taking into account the size of the company), also has positive EBITDA, Operating Income and POSITIVE NET INCOME!!! 

Below you'll find some highlights of the earning call which had place last friday

Gross profit +51,2% 2019 -> 2020 

Gross margin +21% 2019 -> (actually has a 57% GROSS MARGIN!)

Net income +176%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

EPS is 0,21... So, PER is 3,8/0,21 = x18... (EPS is +133% YoY)

Do you know wich is the median PER of the SP500? 44,54 (you can see at [macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/) or Wall Street Journal Market Data)

In fact, it is ridiculous, specially if you consider that CLEU is a growth company, not a value company (growth company often has higher PER)

And it's being more ridiculous if I told you that company has 5M on cash... At this point you are thinking ""Where is the trick? Maybe has a lot of debt""... But not, it only has 1,67M on debt.

Taking into account all what I told you: Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = 16,67M

EV/REV = 3,17 that in fact is extremely low for a growth company and for the market average

I'm not going to elaborate a text about the future of this bussines sector. We already know that online education is the future, specially in China. (Off course traditional lessons will never disappear, but think in the private lessons). You can think about the future of this alone. It's not usual find this kind of growth companys who already earn money (think about the spacs, how many of the new companies has EBITDA>0 or even more, NET INCOME >0?)

And what about technical analysis? Let me share the chart with you

That’s normal and not at all silly. It makes perfect sense if you’re looking to customize your level of exposure to a particular stock or stocks.

> For example, let’s say I want to buy KO, but one of my ETF has 4.8% KO

If you want greater exposure to KO than the ETF offers, then of course it makes sense to buy shares as well.

> Also, is it “ok” to have two ETFs that have similar holdings?

Sure, why not?

> I want to get a comm ETF that holds Netflix, but it has a lot of the same positions I have in another ETF. Would it be better just to directly invest in Netflix instead of going through an ETF?

That depends. Is exposure to NFLX your only objective, or do you like the ETF for other reasons? If you just want to own NFLX, it makes the most sense to just buy the stock as you avoid a management fee.

(data got form simply wall st and seeking alpha) For example, Cowen's p/e is 3, it's return on equity is 37% and it has insiders owning little over 4% of the stock. Cowen also has cash & short term investments of 4.8B, Debt of 3B so with a market cap of 1.1B for every stock, you get 60$ of debt free cash. It has just started to pay dividend last year but they  have raise it from 0,04$/q to 0,1$/q. I know it still isn't a significant amount of dividends, but I think they will raise it quite a bid during next couple of years. They have also increased their buyback program from 20M to 50M and they stated in their earnings transcript that they might return money to shareholders even more in upcoming year/years.

Frothy markets are good for capital markets banks. The risks with middle market banks like Cowen is they are active on smaller deals and thus don’t command the major deals like the bulge bracket.

Last month's most discussed stocks and retail trader’s obsession with volatile stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued updates. So here goes! 

https://preview.redd.it/v5m5t4zzuww61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=8253293316a29c3b81d5b8e32c246f8007412ff5

Even though Microvision overtook GME in mentions during the last week of April, overall GME was much more talked about in April. Newcomers to the list were Coinbase due to their IPO and Clover health due to its massive short interest.

 The above graphs show how retail traders love to discuss only high-volatility stocks. The average Beta value across the top 10 most discussed stocks last month was 3.14! 

In case you are not well versed with Beta, the following is its explanation from Investopedia.

>Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. By definition, the market, such as the S&P 500 Index, has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the market.

This was one of the most requested information in my posts. Above are the returns you would have got if you invested in the trending stocks last month. 5/9 stocks (ignoring SPY) gave a positive return last month but only 2 of them beat SPY. This is important considering the amount of risk (beta shown above) you are taking with the individual stock. The returns are benchmarked using March 31st closing price and April 30th closing price.

**A 100% Cloud-Based SaaS Platform, And The Future Of Supply Chain Management**

\*Note\* I posted this a few days ago on WSB. Mods deleted it (probably not enough rocket emojis), so I figured this might be a more suitable place for discussion!. Cheers!

With the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain, and recent events such as the Suez Canal blockage, as well as the Semiconductor Shortage, there has never been a stronger demand for Supply Chain efficiency. President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US’’ need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.

**COMPANY SUMMARY**

*“Leaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.” \~ Tom Peters*

Essentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).

ETWO has only recently went public on February 21’, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it’s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it’s fundamentals and it’s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).

* *A Snapshot of its largest customer base:*

**Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors:**

* Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications
* integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain
* First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization
* Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base
* Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space
* Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software
* Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model

**VALUATION**

The stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it’s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it’s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it’s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it’s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis.

One of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow. In $ETWO's case, this comes from it's subscription sales, which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times . This is another strength that $ETWO possesses, as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate - which is a an indicator of a massive moat, which can allow $ETWO to retain profits from its competitors. This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO:

* Strong Performance on Key Metrics:

**What Wallstreet is Saying**

*“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” \~ Warren Buffett,*

Although it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:

*""E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.""*

**One Final and Intriguing Note:**

A few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it’s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).

Short Interest:

I am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.

**TL;DR:**

The cheaply valued ETWO and it’s value proposition, it’s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it’s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.

n3vf1z,,StockMarket,post,1620046844,"The Short Iron Condor Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m continuing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. If you will find this helpful, I will appreciate any sort of feedback. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Short Iron Condor.

A Short Iron Condor is a neutral option strategy that allows traders to profit from an underlying that trades flat or range bound. Other ways to profit from a short iron condor is through a decrease in [Implied volatility](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=1005 ) and the passage of time (theta)

A short iron condor consists of buying 2 options and selling 2 options all of the same expiration date, which thus comprises 4 options in this strategy in total. It is simply a combination of a Bull Put Spread and a Bear Call Spread. (For now you can skip what this means but if you would like to learn the basics of vertical spreads that make up for such strategies such as this one, click [here](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=371))

Take a look at this example.

Stock FFF is trading at $60, a trader speculates that the stock will continue to trade flat with little movements for the foreseeable future. The Trader forms a speculative assumption that the stock could potentially stay between 55 to 65 in the next 2 weeks. Therefore, the trader sets up a bull put spread with the short strike being at 55 and a bear call spread with its short strike being at 65 with the long strikes being 5 points away from each of the short strikes. Since neither of the 4 options are set up with any intrinsic value, these spreads are considered OTM.
 
* March 2/21 Long 50 Put- $1.20
* March 2/21 Short 55 Put- $2.10
* March 2/21 Short 65 call- $2.30
* March 2/21 Long 70 call- $1.30

This comes out to a total net credit of 1.9/$190. Net credit is simply the difference in what you receive from selling the short options minus the premium paid for buying the long options in the strategy. Alternatively, you can look at it as the sum of the net credit of the bull put spread and the bear call spread. Either way, you get the same total net credit. (2.30+2.10) – (1.20 +1.30)= 1.90. This net credit is = max profit, the maximum amount you stand to make from this trade. 

**Max Profit** 

The max profit is realized when the stock trades in between the short put and the short call at expiration. In this case if the stock trades at $63 at expiration which is between 55-65, both the Bull Put Spread and the Bear call spread expires worthless and max profit is attained.

**Max loss**

The max loss is equivalent to the width of the strikes – the net credit received. Since the width of the strikes in this example = $5, and the net credit of the iron condor =$1.90, the max loss of this trade is 5-1.90= $3.10. Max loss is realized when the stock trades above the long call or below the long put at expiration. Hence, if the stock trades at 70 and above or 50 and below at expiration, max loss will be attained. This is because as the stock moves out of the profitable range, the stock can only breakout from 1 side and hence a trader only loses on 1 spread of the iron condor and gains on the other (either bull put or bear call spread). 

To explain this further, If the stock breaks out to the upside and trades at 75 at expiration, you will take the max loss on the bear call spread (width – net credit of the bear call spread). However the bull put spread will be at its max profit zone and expire worthless resulting in a profit of its net credit. Thus, if you take the max loss of the bear call spread – the max profit of the bull put spread, it would derive the same result from taking the width of the iron condor – total net credit. However if the iron condor is set up with different widths apart on the bear call and bull put spreads, the max loss will be equal to the larger width of both spreads minus the total net credit

**Breakeven**

An iron condor has 2 breakeven points one towards the downside and the other towards the upside. The downside breakeven= short put- total net credit. The upside breakeven= short call + total net credit. Using these calculations In the example shown above the breakeven points are 53.1 and 66.9. This means that if the stock drops and is at 53.1 at expiration, you will breakeven on this trade. Same can be said for the upside where if the stock rises and is at 66.9 at expiration, you will also breakeven.

**Profit zone:(not the same as max profit)**

With the breakeven points established, the profitable upside zone will between the short call strike and the breakeven point of the upside. In this example, the upside profit zone = 65.01-66.89.  The downside profitable zone will be between the short put strike and the breakeven point of the downside. The downside profit zone in this example will be = 54.99- 53.11.

**Loss zone:(not the same as max loss)**

the upside loss zone will be between the upside breakeven point and the long call. The upside loss zone in this example = 66.91-69.99. The downside loss zone will be between the downside breakeven point and the long put. The downside loss zone in this example= 53.09-50.01.

**The highlights of this analysis are as follows:**

* The management has changed the business model of GoPro into a more DTC business. 
* GoPro's subscription side of their business had 55% QoQ and 145% YoY growth rates.
* GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model.
* The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly (consumer electronics, photographic equipment, and action camera's)
* GoPro's main competition is DJI, Akaso, and Garmin (especially in the action camera market)

**Investment Plan:**

* Buy between $10-14 and hold long-term (until it reaches fair value)
* Sell if the stock falls below $10.49
* Look for re-entry at $8.80-$9.20 (if stock falls below $10.49 and you sell)

**Stocks Fair Value:**

Using a DCF (as seen in the analysis below), GoPro has an estimated share value of $39.12, this implies a potential upside of 248.35%. 

If you  follow my advice above there is only a 6.59% downside risk before selling and re-entry, this makes the risk-to-reward of my trading strategy very favourable.

# Analysis

**Company Overview:**

GoPro manufactures and sells cameras, drones, and other filming/photography accessories. Their main products consist of the HERO7, HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras, and a MAX 360-degree waterproof camera. The HERO 9 camera is the best-selling camera in the US digital market. GoPro also offers cloud-based storage solutions that enables customers to access, edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro’s cameras. GoPro also offers camera protection plans (GoPro Care) and video editing applications (Quik).

GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors/distributors, as well as through their own e-commerce store. GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014, and since its IPO has fallen by over 31%.

GoPro has a TTM revenue of $891.9M, a TTM EBITDA of -$22.6M and a market cap of 1.719B. Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N/A, putting a value on this company is difficult.

Recently, GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this. GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer (DTC) approach in their business model, this has led them to scale back on spending, sales and marketing expenditures, and office space. Furthermore, the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition. This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future.

Investment Information:

**Company and Financial Information:**

GoPro has 3.2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms. This exposure can be leveraged to market their products, and gain product awareness at a significant discount. Furthermore, they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made.

GoPro’s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52% QoQ, and 145% YOY. This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company.

GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021, these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model, increase the DTC component of their business, and grow their gross margins from 36% to 38-40%.

GoPro has 771,000 subscribers to their subscription service, charging an annual fee of $49.99. This amounts to their subscription service bringing in $38.54M last year.

Furthermore, GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package.

GoPro’s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be $68M at FYE 2020. This results in a 24.57x EBITDA multiple, this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report.

**Industry Information:**

GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market, which is valued at $1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7% between 2020-2026. By 2026 (incorporating current industry trends) the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at $1.5T, with 70% of the market being from audio and visual segments, both of which are segments of GoPro’s business.

Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at $22B and is expected to grow at a 5.78% CAGR for the next 6 years. This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Samsung, however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly, giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry.

Lastly, GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3.5B and is expected to grow at a 14% CAGR until 2026. By this time, the industry is expected to be valued at $5.5B.

By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within, we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to determine the fair value share price.

**Competition:**

DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras. Recently, they have launched their very first action camera, the Osmo Action, which is supposed to compete with GoPro’s HERO7. The Osmo Action has a front-facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7.

Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures. Recently, they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro. The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro, however it comes in at a cheaper price point, and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro.

Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation, automotive, marine, outdoor and sport activities. Garmin’s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera, is similar to many GoPro models, shooting video in up to 4K, with similar size and weight to that of GoPro. The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and altimeter, which may be attractive for some consumers.

**Investment Plan and Valuation:**

Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA, we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company. Instead, we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share.

Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of $39.12. The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on, and if GoPro’s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries.

With that being said, the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience. By looking at their current management and their backgrounds, it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years, and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience. This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro, I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future.

For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro. If you can buy the shares in the $10-14 range, you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return. If you buy at current prices $11.23, I recommend holding unless the stock falls below $10.49, if this happened, I would sell and look for a re-entry at $8.80-9.20, then hold long term.

n3yp4i,,StockMarket,post,1620055123,"You liked RICK (700% return), strip club consumer cyclical play. Now check out BDL, a similarly undervalued restaurant stock primed for a big move.  

Alright Reddit crowd, WSBers, penny-stock-ers. I’m setting you up for an amazing, under the radar, value play in the consumer cyclical space. RICK, the strip club owner, is one of the best performing stocks of the past year, with 700% returns and a lot of value hedge fund back-patting on that one. But they have pumped the price on that one already, and the best of that play is gone. But I have found an even better one, which is pretty much at the same stage where RICK was a year ago. This baby is primed for a huge re-rating and the small float can get it running quickly. Strap in fellow retards, we’re going to FLANIGANS.

Flanigans Enterprises (BDL) owns and operates restaurants and liquor stores in South Florida. With over 30 locations, the stores are incredibly popular and well run. They have managed the pandemic incredibly well, and successfully pivoted to an strong online ordering model which has rolled out successfully. This is a very under the radar stock, but the fundamentals are incredibly solid and once more people, and followers of RICK, catch on, it should jump big time. I have a background in value investing, and this one checks all the boxes for an undervalued small cap stock with very little downside based on its current operating returns. See below for a comparison on key metrics between BDL, RICK, and the consumer discretionary sector as a whole. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jomt44x1axw61.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29b4e61c7714e043a273285da854498c16061a1

As you can see, at minimum BDL has positive net income compared to RICK’s negative, and the same amount of yearly revenue with a market cap 1/15th the size. It has the same amount of debt and is significantly less volatile to RICK and the consumer discretionary sector as a whole. The company generates significant free cash flow and is trading at highly attractive multiples, including at almost 1:1 to book value (the company has a strong portfolio of real estate as well). 

The company also has high insider ownership, a sign of strong belief in the company by management. Significant shares are also owned by Jim Simons Renaissance Technologies, UBS, Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and other value-oriented hedge funds. 

Pandemic aside, they have been growing their net income and free cash flow at a steady clip, and have successfully reinvested the FCF at high returns. The companies ROIC (return on invested capital, a key value investing metric), averages over 10%. 

The stock has been consolidating for a while, hitting a double top at $26. Once it breaks through, it should be clear to 40+ as a price target. 

&#x200B;

All in all, when you look across the restaurant sector in light of the upcoming reopening, Flanigan’s is ready to capitalize on a significant re-rating using their efficient capital management.

TLDR: BDL is in the same place RICK was a year ago, prior to running 700%

So unless you're a high earner, this won't affect you (much). I made these charts about a week or two ago but I heard for the American Families Plan, individuals earning more than $452,700 and married couples earning more than $509,300 (meaning each partners could earn less than $400,000) could see a tax increase.

**What do you mean, ""won't affect you (much)""?**

If there's tax increases for the rich, what will the rich do? They'll take their stock market gains before the tax increases. 2020 saw huge gains so we may see a correction in the coming months. How much of a correction you ask? I don't know but I would guess 10-15% in the broader market. More if you're into speculative high growth stocks. I say that because I know a lot of you have positions on them. Careful how you invest these next few months.

And if there's tax increases for corporations, obviously they'll do whatever they can to avoid them. However even a 1% increase in their taxes (note below I mention that many corporations pay very little taxes because of loopholes) will affect their bottom line. This means earnings will be less and therefore lower stock valuations.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/65swnd332rw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=228f04d002b432308b558a4583878367e49a559b

**So if the rich sell and corporations are being taxed more, how will that affect the stock market?**

1. Less incentive to invest due to more taxes. People will look to other investments or stay cash. (Seriously though, the tax plan won't make a huge difference unless you're a 1%er.)
2. Bonds become more [favorable](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/government-bonds#:~:text=Income%20from%20bonds%20issued%20by%20state%2C%20city%2C%20and%20local%20governments,where%20the%20bond%20was%20issued). Income from bonds issued by state, city, and local governments (municipal bonds, or munis) is generally free from federal taxes. You will, however, have to report this income when filing your taxes. Examples: MUB, HYD, VOHIX, VWAHX.
3. ETFs and Mutual funds are more favorable. They both are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your earnings. ETFs, however, have an advantage over mutual funds due to three reasons: 1) 2018, 89% of ETFs were passive vs. 4% of mutual funds. Less trading involved with passive. 2) Any high dividend or high interest paying securities will receive more distributions, therefore a high tax bill. 3) ETFs have greater liquidity as they are traded during market hours vs. mutual funds are traded at the beginning and end of market sessions.  
\*In 2018, Goldman Sachs did a study that showed 100% of their ETFs did not pay capital gains. Broadly, 90% of ETFs did not pay capital gains compared to 39% of mutual funds.
4. 4. Tax advantaged accounts like Roth IRA and 401K are more favorable. If you're one of the super rich, take a look at the [backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp). It's a way for super rich people to put money into retirement without the contribution limits. Roth IRA contribution limit is $6,000 per year. BUT if you make more than $140,000 as a single or $206,000 filing jointly as married then you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. The easiest way to get by this is converting a traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account.

**What does history** [**say**](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/tax-hikes-history#:~:text=In%20the%2013%20previous%20instances,the%20data%20in%20the%20calendar) **about stock market performance after tax increases?**

""In the 13 previous instances of tax increases just since 1950, the S&P 500, the stock index that tracks most of the major companies in the US, has shown higher average returns, and higher odds of an advance, in times when taxes are increasing, according to Chisholm's research, which analyzed the data in the calendar year of the tax changes, plus the year prior and year after. This pattern holds true even when you drill down into key sectors of the S&P 500."" Here's a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2MaBjOp.png) of the S&P500 performance after tax increases. Not too bad eh?

&#x200B;

**What's happening now with the current tax law?**

* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes. Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM are some of those companies. Corporate tax rate is currently 21%.
* 56 Fortune 500 companies paid 0-5% on their 2018 income.
* 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. I couldn't find any data on this but its due to loopholes in the tax system.

**The Made in America Tax plan**

* Will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis.
* Increase corporate tax rate at 28% from 21%
* Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate.
* The proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries.
* The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations.
* Invert the current law in which U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States.
* A proposal that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. Instead a tax credit will be proposed to support onshoring jobs.
* Invert a Trump tax law for “Foreign Derived Intangible Income” (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&D. Instead the revenue will be used to expand more effective R&D investment incentives.
* Enact a minimum tax of 15% on large corporations’ book income.
* Eliminate tax preferences (worth billions of dollars) for fossil fuels and make sure polluting industries pay for environmental clean up.
* Increase enforcement for tax evasion. Typical workers’ wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent.

&#x200B;

**So what should I do to prepare if this bill passes?**

Nothing different honestly. Keep investing. DCA - dollar cost average if your stocks drop. Stay the course in your high conviction names. De-risk if you have to by investing in safer investments like index funds or ETFs. I know a lot of you are into SPAX (special purpose acquisition companies. I spelled it this way in case this sub banned the real acronym) and other speculative companies. There's almost 500 of them out there. 217 of those were from 2020. To be honest, 1% of those companies will moon. Most of them won't see a return for years. Are you willing to hold them without knowing they will moon in 5-10 years? Some may not even make a return. Make sure you understand market conditions. Stocks really do go up but its only the ones that are backed by strong earnings and potential. Don't get burned. Money is not everything but it's a tool to bring you financial freedom sooner in life. You know what they say, ""there's only two things guaranteed in life: death and taxes"".","['CVX', 'HAL', 'IBM', 'SPGI', 'DE', 'AMZN']"

It isn't easy, but it is time-tested and requires absolutely no higher mathematics. All it takes is the tenacity to read through financial reports and to check your hypothesis for owning a stock. 

My approach is to think of an industry I want to be invested in, then I start googling for stocks within that industry and then I compare financials, prospects, metrics, management, transcripts and everything else in between to find out which one is undervalued and buy in. 

My main criteria is at most only small amounts of debt. Debt is the only thing that bankrupts a company.

I also want to be able to explain exactly what the company that I'm invested in does. I can explain my rationale for investing, and that means I know exactly what is a good price to both buy it and sell it. Stock prices fluctuate for all kinds of different reasons, but if the reason why I bought in in the first place hasn't changed, I don't care where it's trading at. I just average down then. 

People say that buying high and selling low is irrational, but I disagree. I think it makes perfect sense. That's not to say it's a smart thing to do, just that it's what you'd expect to happen if you don't know why you bought a stock. 

If you bought a stock because it was going up, then it makes sense to sell it when it goes down. That's why I recommend to have other reasons for buying stocks, because then you can stomach price fluctuations.",

n3bweh,,StockMarket,post,1619978148,"Investing Philosophy V (Fundamental vs Technical Analysis: which works better? Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?) - 5/2/2021 

Hello investors,

It's been a while since I last posted a memo and I am still going through a busy transition with the work. I hope everyone is staying safe and riding the markets to the top.

**1) Fundamental vs Technical Analysis**

I wanted to discuss a topic that should probably have been addressed earlier. I didn't realize until recently that many of the folks that are just getting started in trading tend to lean more towards the ""technical"" analysis of investing and I believe it is critical to understand what the difference is between a technical and fundamental analysis.

**Quick answer to the question of which works better, there is no better or worse. It's a combination of the two that makes an analysis more comprehensive, based on a** **Mosaic Theory****.**

Just for the sake of formality, here are the quick definitions of each.

**Technical analysis:** Technical analysis is concerned with price action, which gives clues as to the stock’s supply and demand dynamics – which is what ultimately determines the stock price. Patterns often repeat themselves because investors often behave in the same way in the same situation. Technical analysis is concerned with price and volume data alone.

**Fundamental analysis**: Fundamental analysis considers the value of the company. This ultimately depends on the value of its assets and the profits it can generate. Fundamental analysts are concerned with the difference between a stock’s value, and the price at which it is trading.

Many people tend to look at the charts and patterns of stock price movements and make quick decisions based purely on the technicals, such as breaking out of a resistance level, forming a consolidation, gapping, ascending vs descending triangles, moving averages, and so on.

I think what many fail to understand is that these trading strategies are highly specialized, meaning that there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to benefit from this type of analysis and most of them fail to achieve consistent returns.

And these are industry veterans with years of experience and the resources with computing power to recognize patterns and being able to execute on the trade ideas in a millionth of a second.

It's not to say that you can't profit consistently from these strategies. I'm saying you cannot simply rely on ""this stock price just broke the 200-D moving average and has a potential to move exponentially higher"" type of analysis.

There is a concept called **""efficient market hypothesis"" (""EMH"")**, which basically states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible.

Now, I have previously mentioned that it is possible to generate alpha in this memo.

What I didn't mention is different levels of EMH.

**Weak efficiency: This type of EMH claims that all past prices of a stock are reflected in today's stock price. Therefore, technical analysis cannot be used to predict and beat the market.**

**Semi-strong efficiency: This form of EMH implies all public (but not non-public) information is calculated into a stock's current share price. Neither fundamental nor technical analysis can be used to achieve superior gains.**

**The point of today's memo is that I believe the market tends to fluctuate between weak and semi-strong efficiency levels of EMH, meaning a combination of fundamental and technical analysis can lead to excess returns and I personally tend to put a heavier weight into the fundamental analysis.**

From a personal standpoint, technical analysis is almost a 50/50 chance game for an average trader. A person who monitors charts at home during the day out of his/her 4 monitors will almost never generate consistent profits over 10-20 year period.

Don't get me wrong. It is possible to generate alpha for that person.

All I'm saying is of the 1,000 hours he spent monitoring and trading on those securities, only 10 hours of research actually resulted in any profitable ideas and he just racked up tens of thousands of dollars in trading fees, **just to increase his winning odds from 51% of all trades to 52%.**

It's not really an efficient way to use your time and energy if you ask me.

After all, technical trading yields very thin odds of success, anywhere from 51% to 53% winning probability on any single trade. That's why professional investors diversify their strategies across hundreds of different trades in a single hour using automated trades, which an average investor doesn't have the capacity to do so.

My suggestion is to approach it from the Warren Buffett style of investing.

Study the company, understand the business model, and evaluate how the company is priced relative to your view of the intrinsic value.

**One important caution to this approach.**

I have also observed recently that many people tend to buy into this type of analysis: **""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and people will likely to eat out at bars and restaurants and therefore, I will buy the restaurant stocks.""**

Or this, **""Biden administration is pushing clean energy policy and EV stocks will outperform.""**

While these are good ideas to start off of, they're not the end.

It's almost like saying ""US population is increasing and more people will drive cars. Therefore, I will buy auto stocks.""

These are big leaps in assumptions. We need to fill in the gaps.

My suggestion is to think in more depth, especially in terms of numbers.

For example, ""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and restaurant visits are increasing as % of 2019 levels. Darden Restaurants is poised to benefit from this trend because it is highly specialized in an indoor dining experience and the demand is picking up, as evidenced by its growing sales numbers that are higher than its competitors. The stock is currently trading at 37x 2021 P/E, which seems to be undervalued given the fact that it is expected to grow its bottom line at more than 40% over the next three years, yielding a PEG ratio of less than 1. Its peers are also trading at 50x 2021 P/E. Therefore, if the company exceeds the profit growth expectations, the stock has a potential to outperform the market.""

This is a more in-depth fundamental analysis, divided into two parts: 1) qualitative factors that prove why the company is better positioned against its competitors and 2) quantitative factors (mainly the valuation, or what the market priced in) that will drive its stock price outperformance.

**The bottom line is, when you are picking stocks, do not make the big leap in assumptions, coupled with preliminary technical analysis. Instead, approach it from a view of an investor: ""what is good about this business and why would I buy into this company rather than its competitor who seems to be having more success? Is the company priced at an appropriate valuation? Will its market cap grow from $10B to $50B? And why?""**

Which leads me to the second topic of today's memo.

**2) Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?**

The answer is simple: it's because the market has priced in a better outlook than what's reported.

If the street consensus estimate was $2 EPS for a company and the earnings came out to $3, it doesn't mean the stock price will jump. And it can be for many different reasons.

Perhaps the company beat on the earnings but fell below the estimates on the topline.

Or the company's margins shrank dramatically.

Or the company sold lower volumes of a new line of cars than expected, which was supposed to show an exponential growth. But the higher-priced cars offset the losses and still resulted in an earnings beat. The market was pricing in the growth of the new line of cars but now that growth expectation has disappeared.

You really need to think at a high level on earnings beat. It's not a 1+1=2 type of problem.

**On top of that, you will never know what the market has priced in its growth expectations until the actual earnings come out.**

This is because we can only know what the market has priced in only after observing the stock price reaction after the earnings. Because the stock price dropped after the earnings, the market was expecting a better outcome than the actual and by definition, it is an after-the-fact analysis.

Over time, the stock price mean reverts to its earnings potential and any anomalies in the way will be reverted back.

Thus, a better game to play is to focus on its fundamentals, study the earnings, and determine if this company will outperform not just qualitatively but also from a quantitative perspective. Will it expand its trading multiple? Will the earnings outperform the street expectations?

Hope this helps and thank you for reading!

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
> # Big jobs report
> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
> # Earnings soar
> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

> # Here Comes Sell In May

> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

> # Wild Data Close To Q1

> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

Avis, aka $CAR, has been on a steady rise to the moon throughout the entire pandemic. Oddly enough, car rentals are down significantly, and the company is deeply in debt.

Jagdeep Pahwa is on the board of $CAR and currently the Vice President of SRS Capital Management.

SRS Capital Management as of 2/21/21 owns 26.4% of $CAR.

Rumor has it the price is being held up to benefit stakeholders during the Hertz bankruptcy, but I’m not that smart and cannot connect those dots.

I’m simple minded, I look at the price, the product, the lack of a profit, and can’t see this holding the trend any longer. I’m calling $CAR crashes by 50% short term... prove me wrong or join my on YOLO Puts 🤞💎🙌💎",

---

What is it with loser ex-mods hijacking the WSB name and using crypto to scam people?

People keep posting a press release about an ""official"" WallStreetBets distributed app. (Aka, a crypto pyramid scheme) 

Nothing could be further from the truth. We are strongly anti-monetization. This scam has nothing to do with us. 

This is yet another attempt for the pathetic and disgraced founder (removed by Reddit Admins in 2020) to cash out on a subreddit whose only contributions allegedly include:

* Phishing our users

* Attempting to run a shitty paid mentoring group

* Selling advertising on the subreddit

* Trying to turn options trading into an esport

* Selling WSB out to movie producers

* Attempting to change our logo to some god awful abomination

Don't throw away your money on this scam. 

Throw it away on OTM FDs instead.

n4m8mw,,wallstreetbets,post,1620128514,"Nokia is extremely undervalued at current pricesOn April 29, Nokia reported stellar first quarter earnings for 2021: 

Revenue totaled €5.1 billion, 7% above the consensus estimates.

Gross margin was 38.2%, improving from 36.4% in this quarter last year.

EBITDA was €702 million, crushing the estimates of €150 million by over 367%.

It generated €1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, turning positive from the negative €6 million during Q1 2020.

Nokia’s focus on 5G is already paying off. Management is seeing “continued momentum in 5G rollouts across all geographies, especially North America.” And from the favorable margins in Nokia’s 5G products, gross margin in mobile networks improved 2.1% from last year, reaching 33.2% during the quarter.

And Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark – which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations – made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers – a great selling point.

Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark.

And this month technology consulting firm PA Consulting named Nokia “the industry leader in 5G standard essential patents.” Nokia has a leading patent portfolio with over 3,500 patents that are declared as essential to 5G. Nokia’s patent portfolio will help it maintain a technological advantage compared to its competitors.

Nokia remains extremely undervalued at current prices and it remains a strong buy. It was the first breakthrough quarter for Nokia and it is going to be a big winner for us.",

n4ncpw,,wallstreetbets,post,1620131959,"Time to buy the dip $AMD - short DDHello fellow autists.

&#x200B;

Wanted to share some quick DD and some of my reasons why it's a good time to jump on the AMD train as a mid-long term investment. Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.

&#x200B;

**Why buy?**

$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. 

They say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. 

As a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.

&#x200B;

**Chip shortage.**

The elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. 

But I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.

&#x200B;

**Final thought**

End of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.

As always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

n4r47g,,wallstreetbets,post,1620142071,"AMD: An explanation on merger arbitrage and how to play it for big gainsI read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist.

**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?

**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). 

After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/upndown#!\/vizhome\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\_16114624177710\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/wvsnql2p64x61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b19380ad8d798a8e2c8c6d8736d97714c553cd)

In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/gi31myc384x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b1036b008d8c9fea2f74996f7e3c5cf70410e2)

What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. 

So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/xijh87hfb4x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc144da8bbba46b37ddb59f18d306bbad6104599)

I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). 

For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.

The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.

Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I don't really know what I'm doing. But I like the stock.  
Positions: I'm doing both strategies and own AMD shares and call options spread across this year and next year. I also own XLNX shares.","['INTC', 'AMD', 'XLNX']"

**Background on the Sector**

There are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front:

**1) Intent:** This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed.

**2) Diversity:** There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.

**3) Delivery:** Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for ""rewiring"" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's ""This is Life"" series called ""Psychedelic Healing"" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories.

**MindMed DD --> Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this**

[Left: Bruce Linton \(Founder & Ex-CEO of $CGC\) Right: Kevin O'Leary \(Shark Tank\) are big investors\/backers of MindMed](https://preview.redd.it/7rnqywrno0x61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8a41c0038250d725417596045d44295d6016ac)

Though my summary is below, don’t just take my word for it! MindMed has an incredibly well organized [website](https://mindmed.co/) where you can see much of this for yourself.

*As an investor in a sector with a diversity of molecules and a diversity of applications*, you want a company that has a diverse approach. **That’s MindMed** \- which is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials with each 18-MC, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and psilocybin tackling a variety of conditions, including anxiety, opioid withdrawal, ADHD, and cluster headaches, to name a few. This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O’Leary (yes, Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed.

*As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists*, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. **MindMed is the whole package.** MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about **how** we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector.

*As an investor in a sector that is ""breakthrough"" in nature*, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. **Bruce Linton**, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments.

Finally, I know every investor wants to know how much the stock price will move over time, so here are a few catalysts to think on:

[FDA \\""Breakthrough\\"" designation coming?](https://preview.redd.it/5llgt3osv0x61.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=c428b419525972f2570d9cdbf6462a8b15ac4dee)

**Next catalysts:** This is more obvious, but of course any trial milestones are catalysts! I’m particularly excited about August/September this year when we expect Phase 2b trial results to begin rolling in, though Phase 1 announcements will continue to occur as the portfolio grows as well. With any luck, breakthrough designations will accelerate trials and portfolio growth further.","['CVS', 'COO', 'NDAQ']"

n4t05t,,wallstreetbets,post,1620146651,"An introduction to patent dataFrom 1970 to 2019, the US Patent Trademark Office (USPTO) has received a 567% increase in patent applications. Patents provide their holders intellectual property rights regarding a process, design, or invention for a period of time (20 years in the U.S.). With thousands of patent applications filed daily, the data is invaluable as it can give its viewer real-time insight into industry trends and company R&D investments.

I recently built a dashboard tracking data on patent applications and approvals. One component of the dashboard which I'm particularly proud of is a visualization that maps patents granted to public companies over the last 4 years based on the text contained within their abstracts. Dots are colored by patent date, and the map is easily filterable by a company or by keyword. You can play around with the visualization [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/n4sdum/i_built_a_new_dashboard_which_tracks_patents/) (may take a few seconds to load due to the large number of points in the graph)

[Static image of the patent visualization](https://preview.redd.it/ycm67uv5q4x61.jpg?width=1119&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b94b88bdaf35d54edc07804028b759e91a14c96)

In this post I'll be sharing some analysis of U.S. patents granted to public companies, and searching for broad trends within the data.

**Industry Analysis**

For a high-level look at the data, I consolidated patent grants by industry to determine which sectors are generating the most intellectual property:

[2020 patent approvals by industry](https://preview.redd.it/fshwnhkgq4x61.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d30c3b04baf6b3d06d600bb1daa98584318fc25)

Companies within the Software and Semiconductors industries received the most overall patent approvals in 2020, accounting for 42.2% of all patents. This makes sense because not only are Software/IT companies traditionally tech-focused, but they also represent the largest industry market cap weight in the S&P 500, with $7.81 trillion as of 04/23/2021.

Reinforcing the trend above, below are the top 10 patent producers over the last 4 years: 

[Top 10 patent producers](https://preview.redd.it/hrs9mi8jq4x61.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=1483c23091026e28209163f28d750ee08299ef22)

Tech and semiconductor-based companies maintain 6 out of the top 10 spots in patent applications. Additionally, their annual patent application growth has consistently outpaced companies in outside industries.

**Patent Trends**

Further demonstrating the patent database's scope, I created a table using words sourced from the abstracts of patents, exhibiting the percent change in word usage within patents from 2018 to the present:

[Word usage](https://preview.redd.it/5z2o6ib4r4x61.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b122fe559003ce56611ef90524b1fcad8b30a9d)

Analysis of the table above reveals that machine learning and IT-based patents have shown strong year-over-year growth, while mechanical and manufacturing patents contracted.

This growth in patent approvals is parallel to current market conviction towards software-based, pattern-prediction companies such as C3.ai **(NYSE: AI)** & Palantir Technologies **(NYSE: PLTR)**, trading at 32.51 & 37.55 EV/Revenue ratios respectively, in contrast, high-tech industrial companies like General Electric **(NYSE: GE)** currently trade at 1.93 EV/Revenue Ratio. (04/30/2021)

The table below contains other examples for research areas that are trending upward and revealing of underlying R&D trends:

[Research areas](https://preview.redd.it/ojwqkxr9r4x61.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=826baa7741a494ac5bc9400b08106d6c606a2aed)

The practice of isolating patients and industries above is easily replicable and can give the viewer key insights into technological movements not yet recognized by the greater public.

**Patent Approvals & Share Price**

I was curious to see if there was a relationship between patent approvals and stock price movement. For a preliminary analysis, I ran simple regressions between these two variables for several tech-focused industries.

One example is shown below; I found no clear relationship between patent approvals and stock price change for Software companies in recent years. Across the board, I found there is very little to be gained by simply looking at a company's patent approval counts.

[Patent approvals and share price](https://preview.redd.it/wr3iycvfr4x61.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5909dcae4aef69121fea6dd93bebb8c45634f42)

One of the possible explanations is the wide variation in each patent's value. A patent that gives a defensible advantage in a quickly-growing technological field is incredibly valuable, while many other patents never effect a company's operations at all.

Another dynamic is that it can take several years for a patent holder to pursue monetization of an approved patent. A company's lagged patent profile may be a better indicator of the value of their intellectual property, rather than recent grants.

[ On the website, Clover says its currently in 8 states, However, it is actually in 10 states however they haven't released that info yet. Just looking at the growth chart that YOY growth is huge, 2021 I expect will be huge especially if the Medicare age is lowered. ](https://preview.redd.it/jq5j24xe50x61.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ddbc4ed0d0e6a16074747a2f82a98a28222622)

[ We can also see here, Clover is the fastest-growing medicare company in 2020, simply look at the chart yourself. This rapid growth only accelerates Clovers fuel. ](https://preview.redd.it/cbm19gof50x61.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f623b391031634a4d4f34e84ae39106d516737)

[ Clover is backed by one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet or Google.   Something that should be pointed out is that Google's partnering with CLOV could be massive. MSFT is investing heavily in healthcare technology. Both company's market cap is 1T+ \(credit to u\/sugardaddy for telling me this\)](https://preview.redd.it/t41zlb3k50x61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f4ce646c7f99e99d6e2459059aa0688e922057c)

[ Clover is an innovative disrupting company, its mission is to lower the cost of Medicare plans, Clover sees that the healthcare system is broken as healthcare is expensive. What does Cathie Woods love? Disrupting innovation! I think if Cathie saw this stock she'd definitely buy in! ](https://preview.redd.it/vfoqs0rl50x61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d99f6a09ffd517206fd4233c26dc4c1617c3d47)

[ Clovers growth has been growing rapidly, I do believe 2021 will be a fantastic year for Clover, and maybe report its first profitable quarter.](https://preview.redd.it/fiinjtmn50x61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2768290fc6df4867fe0d723ca88d3847407d1c5d)

**Comparing Clover to Teladoc**

[ Teladoc currently has a 25 billion market cap with a 10&#37; short float. ](https://preview.redd.it/asptmh9060x61.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=697a12de87dafddde75b9f5e81007f730329e4b2)

[ Clover has a 3.77 billion market cap, with a 30-40&#37; short interest. Teladoc is nearly 6.6x bigger than Clover, if Clover is even half of Teladoc's market cap, it'd be trading around 4x higher.](https://preview.redd.it/qtpq5cj160x61.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e4fb6fd2f277003b6af3428198d0ead0a060086)

[ Looking at the call options, on the 5\/21 expiration, there are a LOT of OI calls for Clover. This makes a Gamma squeeze possible](https://preview.redd.it/8pe4fkf260x61.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=0917209919a165bfd026a4835bbb92018309671e)

There is still a lot to be covered, this is only a small part.

TL;DR: Short + Gamma squeeze possible good company backed by Google fastest medicare growth company + possible medicare age lowered which could give potentially millions of more customers for Clover.

My positions:

**My pick for May 2021 is $BP (formerly The British Petroleum Company).**

There are dozens of catalysts, for example:

* Rising oil prices ([https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices))

* BP is constantly expanding into renewable energy to diversify ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300574](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300574), [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-technology-could-transform-renewable-energy-bp-and-chevron-just-invested-11613458808](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-technology-could-transform-renewable-energy-bp-and-chevron-just-invested-11613458808))

He recommended a HOLD, based off, ""Most importantly, the company now sits on C$700Mn of cash and will look to M/A both domestic and elsewhere. Price Target $1.40. 

Tamy Chen, ranked #6,461 out of 7,491 as a analyst. She is not even a 1 star rated analyst. She recommended sell.  I remember the last webcast and she seemed negative about M/A and the joint venture.  

So, I am going to stay with Pabio's expert opinion of HOLDING. This rating was posted almost two months ago. I am looking forward to E/R on May 11th and will be attending the live WEBCAST on May 12th.

Personally, I think a lot people who are short selling this stock are going to get burned 🔥.

n3vlr0,,wallstreetbets,post,1620047338,"🔥$NOK has potential to reach $10+🚀🚀🚀$NOK has the potential to reach $10+, here's why:

# Revenue and Earnings Beat

Net sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the FactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion. The sales beat was driven by growth in Nokia’s mobile networks unit — due to strong sales of 5G equipment — and its network infrastructure segment.

Citi analysts expected the “very strong” revenue and operating profit beat to drive significant upgrades to 2021 consensus forecasts. They noted that while the guidance remains unchanged, management said the first quarter provides a solid base for hitting the higher end of its 7% to 10% operating margin range. They maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of €3.55.

# NOK's 5G segment gains traction

Nokia has been working globally to deploy its 5G solutions. **The company was recently** [**determined**](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/04/28/nokia-ranked-as-number-one-in-5g-patents/) **to have the most number of essential 5G patents of any operator by independent analysts at PA Consulting.**

* 5G mobile networks services expected to increase 5-8 percent by end of 2023.
* Restructuring plan that prioritized mobile networks – including 5G – along with wired infrastructure (fiber), cloud and network services, and Nokia technologies.
* NOK is deploying a 5G network in the UAE in conjunction with Etisalat, a major telecom operator in the emerging markets sector.
* Partnering with Telefonica Spain to help deploy 5G service to Spain's residents by upgrading the telecom's IP network.
* NOK will work with NewCore Wireless to use the Tribal Educational Broadband Service (EBS) to deploy wireless broadband connectivity – including 5G – to rural and underserved Native American communities.
* New MIMO radios coming soon
* Dish Network is going to be using NOK's NetGuard solution for their cloud native open RAN 5G wireless network (this is HUGE) - cred: u/BATTLECATHOTS

Look motherfuckers, this is not legal financial advice... I believe this play is backed by strong fundamentals. First and foremost, they tripled revenue in FY20 while managing to keep expenses flat - as analogous to FY19. ROE % for the quarter that ended December 2020: 136.44%.

1. Low interest rates will be a catalyst for sizeable earnings this quarter. Everyone is refinancing their homes amidst the market euphoria.
2. The stock is intrinsically undervalued, I'll link a DD that explains it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket\_companies\_rkt\_dd\_on\_an\_undervalued\_gem/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket_companies_rkt_dd_on_an_undervalued_gem/)

n45z4d,,wallstreetbets,post,1620072588,"RKT earnings options playRight now, I see a unique options play on RKT earnings. If you were to acquire some OTM call options for the may 7th 23.50 strike, if the calls go in the money and you pay 50 bucks for each contract, big fat ROI over  5 day time period.

Current vol and open interest on the call side is rather high. We are not seeing a ton of trading volume for the shares of RKT, but I personally believe this is the calm before the storm.

Therefore - I believe the price of RKT call options are grossly mispriced and the potential for the stock to move 10% or higher shortly before and after earnings is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-40%. Historically this has happened before so it's not outside the realm of possibility. Because the stock stays stable for so long, calls are much cheaper than gambling on something like MVIS or GME (I guess due to implied volatility being lower comparatively).

The keener among you may have seen how this played out with short dated Tesla options on last Friday. The stock was trading down.. then did a complete upwards reversal, turning 1500 dollar call options into 30,000-50000 dollars in one day for seemingly no reason.

Usually I never take the risk on short dated OTM calls but this time it's different. I think there is too much evidence stacking up to the fact that RKT has something under their sleeves for this earnings call. Fundamentally I expect a strong beat.. but they could also announce another special dividend or stock buyback. This is your time to buy the rumor sell the news.

TLDR, buy lots of RKT call options expiring 5/7 at the 23.50 strike or higher. I'm holding 2 contracts at the 23.50 may 7 strike. I plan on scoping more contracts up if the stock falters tomorrow then holding through earnings. If you want less risk - you can opt for the longer dated contracts just in case the market is stupid and doesn't react to RKT earnings by Friday. Just keep in mind that the further out in date you go - the more expensive the contracts are. I guess you COULD just buy shares too. There is more upside with calls, albeit you are risking more in exchange for the increased leverage.

What Happened: Numerous law firms joined in filing class-action lawsuit complaints on behalf of shareholders against Plug Power. After the market closed on Monday, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP and the Klein Law Firm reminded investors that they have until May 7 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status.

The lawsuit filed against Plug Power by the Klein Law Firm alleges that:

n4ootb,,wallstreetbets,post,1620135924,"DD: $ASO - Lawyers, Guns, and MoneyIf you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation.",['PEG']

* Revenue and Earnings Beat
* Net sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the FactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion. The sales beat was driven by growth in Nokia’s mobile networks unit — due to strong sales of 5G equipment — and its network infrastructure segment.
* Citi analysts expected the “very strong” revenue and operating profit beat to drive significant upgrades to 2021 consensus forecasts. They noted that while the guidance remains unchanged, management said the first quarter provides a solid base for hitting the higher end of its 7% to 10% operating margin range. They maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of €3.55.
* NOK's 5G segment gains traction Nokia has been working globally to deploy its 5G solutions. The company was recently determined to have the most number of essential 5G patents of any operator by independent analysts at PA Consulting.
* 5G mobile networks services expected to increase 5-8 percent by end of 2023.
* Restructuring plan that prioritized mobile networks – including 5G – along with wired infrastructure (fiber), cloud and network services, and Nokia technologies.
* NOK is deploying a 5G network in the UAE in conjunction with Etisalat, a major telecom operator in the emerging markets sector. Partnering with Telefonica Spain to help deploy 5G service to Spain's residents by upgrading the telecom's IP network.
* NOK will work with NewCore Wireless to use the Tribal Educational Broadband Service (EBS) to deploy wireless broadband connectivity – including 5G – to rural and underserved Native American communities.
* New MIMO radios coming soon Dish Network is going to be using NOK's NetGuard solution for their cloud native open RAN 5G wireless network

**$OPEN will be massive and will make apes millionaires in the long run, here is why:**

Real estate is a 2.5 trillion dollar industry and one of the few industries that has not been (yet) disrupted. If you have ever purchased a home you know **how fucking awful the process of buying real estate is.** Going to open houses, Your agent Tracy can’t find anything you like because she got her real estate license only because she is hot . Putting an offer on a house just to get overbid by Keith from California offering 100k over the asking price.

Opendoors ($OPEN) is disrupting this industry and attempting to cut the middle man, the real estate agent, and implementing the iBuyer model where you sell the house directly to them, for cash that is available in 48 hours. Fucking insane.

Now, how effective is this model? Well, in 2020 they generated 2.6 BILLION in revenue, in the middle of a fucking pandemic. Which was 45% less than 2019 when they made “Only” $4.7 Billion. [Here is the 2020 report](https://notorious-rob.com/2021/03/vip-opendoor-technologies-q4-and-full-year-2020-results-guess-whos-back/) They sold about 3,000 homes in 2017. Before Covid-19 hit, Opendoor sold just shy of 19,000 homes in 2019. That is over 6X growth in just two years.

&#x200B;

[That’s enormous growth.](https://preview.redd.it/r2ftcz7tbzw61.jpg?width=943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=914753ab2d5075b8ff669a693bd188986e205a99)

&#x200B;

Every Industry that has a middleman agent has been disrupted, cutting the agent out of the picture. Internet sales is and it will continue to erase the typical salesman to reduce the margin. This provides convenience for the buyer and more profits for the company. Almost every industry that used to rely upon high-pressure salesman has been disrupted by technology. Replacing all the bottle service girls who got their real estate license and have a profile picture with crossed arms selling real estate will not be hard to replace.

Replaced the past years:

~~Travel Agents:~~ Internet

~~Insurance Agents:~~ Internet

~~Stock Broker Agents:~~ Internet

~~Car Salesman:~~ Internet

~~Taxis:~~ Internet

~~Me~~: My wife boyfriend

Why I Like the stock:

**The business model is the future**

Realtors are riped to go extinct like every other middleman agent. When was the last time you called a stockbroker to buy a stock? When was the last time to sit down with a travel agent to buy plane tickets? Or with an Insurance agent to buy insurance for your Volkswagen Jetta 2011? Buying real online is inevitable.

**Strong Revenues even during a pandemic:**

This is not a startup with products that don’t exist, they are not rolling down a truck like Nikola. They have 2.6 Billion dollars in revenue in a bad year.

**Overly Shorted Stock:**

Shorties lack wrinkles in their brain and decided to short this stock because they don't like Chamath, After the pandemic, a lot of whales took big positions against the real estate market and shorted growth stocks like Rocket, and Opendoors. You know what happens when these bets turns against them.

• housing market is INSANE right now. Many houses being sold well above asking price. Housing shortage throughout the country. 4 million houses short of buyer demand (per WSJ HERE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400) 

• Fed is keeping interest rates low, which is incentivizing people to buy, refinance, and so forth. Anecdote, I refinanced my house in February because it was only $3,000 cost to me, but I would save buckets over the life of the loan. 

• Rising cost of lumber is forcing new homes to be more expensive. Thus, mortgage companies are financing *more* money. 

• $RKT releases earnings on Wednesday, which will be a huge catalyst of what’s to come. Last earnings they went through the roof, gaining near 100% in the short term. 

• $RKT’s competition $LDI smashed earnings this morning with $0.98 EPS, compared to an expected $0.58 EPS. LDI seems to be a much smaller company, and I think this could be indicative of a huge beat for RKT. 

• currently 8% short interest (pretty low, but the stock itself also has relatively low volume)

Why I think a cucked generation of millenials will blow RKT's ER on May 5th to UranusAlright, time for some grown-up DD. I've been busy with a side project I think folks here will like so haven't been posting too much but ya'll need to learn this.

**What drives stock price?**

Same thing as to why completely average girls on Twitch give you a boner. You had low expectations, and reality was somehow a little bit better

And what's the expectation for RKT right now? Pretty low

Mainstream news has been spitting the same fear, uncertainty, and doubt every week. Rising interest rates = less housing demand. And analysts have been expecting an EPS based on a hypothetical rate increase that the Fed constantly re-iterates will not happen until 2023 your goddamn CPI inflation basket of milk, eggs, and dildos be damned.

BUT. I believe RKT's Q1 ER on Wed, May 5th will be better than expected. And given the low volume these days, any surge in volume could cause some crazy spike.

**What makes you so confident?**

(1) Look at this chart of housing supply from Redfin. We are at an all-time low for active homes for sale in the US. Normally this would be worrying since it might mean less supply = less mortgages but...

[Source: https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/us-housing-market](https://preview.redd.it/luusztbl8vw61.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=09da688b17fa7ce9a26993de0c11c48d83d53671)

(2) Newly listed homes are on pace and trending like every year before it. So that means houses are still getting listed as usual, but every house that gets listed immediately gets gobbled up by buyers

[That dip in 2020 was due to COVID](https://preview.redd.it/atm8lsbl8vw61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8bbf8afb44906ae9f3ee75712c2e633b803aa2)

(3) This is further evidenced by OFFICIAL [CENSUS.GOV](https://CENSUS.GOV) data that house buying is currently at an all-time-fucking-high

[Source: https:\/\/www.census.gov\/construction\/nrs\/pdf\/newressales.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/t0jsqep07vw61.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=55507ff8b3a649bd65834ab05fae7e61527e4e7e)

**But what about the future?**

True retards here are all too familiar with buying FDs for ERs only to become confused beggars when all the numbers beat but it still crashes. That's because ERs are never about past performance, but about future guidance.

""Yeah, and since this 2020-2021 mortgage/refinance craze is just a temporary thing due to COVID, the future is bleak for RKT!"" I hear an overpaid hedge fund intern with 3 MBAs exclaim like Archimedes shouting ""Eureka!"" down the street naked

That's where I also think RKT and the market will surprise us.

I strongly believe there is an entire generation of cuckolded millenials who are finally buying houses after years of pursuing ""experiences"" and ""living with friends"" in ""the big city where there are real jobs that require but don't require my college degree"" which is causing a bottleneck / zerg rush to the rest of the country all buying houses at once.

Just fucking look at these top 10 fastest growing metros from Redfin. Fucking BOISE IDAHO? These scream to me as ""I tried to make something of my life in my 20s in the city but never got anywhere and now I'm in my 30s/40s and give up and need to adult and this is the only place I could afford something so I can feel like I achieved something"". Accelerated by COVID.

RKT is the second-largest lender for FHA and VA loans, of which I also suspect many of these are.

**What else?**

For folks new to the mouth-gaping awe that is Rocket Companies' bulgy thick-veined protruding member, here's a quick rundown:

* **Profitable** \- For the full-year of 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/#:~:text=For%20the%20full%2Dyear%20of,up%20a%20record%2Dsetting%20year))
* **Special dividend** \- RKT issued a special dividend of $1.11, roughly 4.5%, only 7 months after IPO on 3/8/2021. That's a ballsy move and shows they got money to spare
* **Buyback** \- RKT also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program back on 11/10/2020 ([source](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2020/11/10/quicken-loans-rocket-companies-third-quarter-profits-buyback/6239432002/)). We don't know when or if it's been deployed yet, but again it shows an insane amount of confidence in your cash flow to do something only 3 months after IPO
* **Advertising** \- RKT has also started investing heavily in sponsorships and advertising, again to appeal to millenials. They sponsored the [Super Bowl](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2021/01/07/rocket-mortgage-super-bowl-squares-sweepstakes-returns-for-super-bowl-lv-after-awarding-1-75-million-in-last-years-big-game/) with a contest and commercials, an [Indy 500](https://racer.com/2021/04/01/paretta-lands-rocket-pro-tpo-backing-for-indy-500/) car, and also sponsored the [100 Thieves League of Legends Training Room](https://youtu.be/h4SMSCKOXO8?t=59) for some fucking reason. I think they're just flexing at this point
* **Auto** \- It also looks like RKT has launched early access to their Rocket Auto platform ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/mz14jr/rkt_auto_looks_like_rkt_has_launched_early_access/)). Credit to [u/amru\_ons](https://www.reddit.com/user/amru_ons/) for the find. Carvana is currently worth 49.16B which is MORE than RKT at 44.55B which boggles my mind.

**What do the naysayers say?**

* **I thought RKT mostly did refinances?** I don't believe RKT has ever disclosed exactly what % of their revenue comes from refinances vs mortgages but regardless, the refinance boom has armed the company with tons of cash to transition the company into the Amazon of loans aka the next great FinTech company
* **Why has the stock been pinned flat ever since IPO?** Honestly, I don't know. Some people speculate not enough float and that Dan Gilbert owns \~92% so banks are crushing the stock to screw him but I don't really follow that logic.
* **Wat about mah short squeeze?!?!** Sadly, I do believe the squeeze has already been squoze and sadly it was only a 1-day affair. Short interest was at \~45% going into March 1st spike but now is only 7.56%. But the good news is that this can finally rise naturally like so many IPO companies do 6-9 months after IPO

**Positions or ban**

Still got my 73,652.485 share of RKT all in. I re-invested all my dividends via DRIP that's why there's the awkward fractional shares I can't figure out how to get rid of which breaks the UI. The average cost is $24.12 and current price is overflowed by the UI.

[My fractional shares broke the shitty TD Ameritrade UI](https://preview.redd.it/uqslmda97vw61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84cdd0e04b1e8ca4cdcd0012436029d9eec82b6c)

For further proof of my diamond hands, here's the graph showing my hold from $1.7M up to $3M back down to $1.66M now.

[Remember: 8 digits or bust](https://preview.redd.it/1vwgais97vw61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4583346a3cc087529f2230b8b394c28df4efed2b)

n48yea,,wallstreetbets,post,1620080133,"Corn: Ethanol Demand, Lack of Supply, Odd Weather and Expensive InputsTLDR: **Long July corn** (futures preferred) although any ETF with exposure to cash corn would be OK. There are also options on corn. I'm sorry if you can't trade futures. The next contract in September would not be preferred since that's the start of the harvest which usually runs into November.

If you have been watching the news, expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month. That shouldn't be too worrying, since the May Corn which set a high at $7.40/bsh was due to lack of old-stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession. This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and rapidly decreasing grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below.

**Ethanol Demand**: Who uses the most corn? Nope, not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers. What happens to all that ethanol? Except for some good ol' states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100% pure American anticommunist gasoline, the ethanol is used for fuel. A quick google search will yield [articles reporting that fuel demand for end of March has surpassed levels set during 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-products-gasoline/u-s-gasoline-demand-exceeds-2020-levels-for-first-time-in-2021-opis-idUSKBN2BM1UR). Americans are driving/traveling again as more and more of us are getting vaccinated, simply don't care, or are forced to commute back to the office. This will result in continued high demand for gasoline, and thus ethanol.

**Lack of Supply**: This is the critical part that resulted in May Corn's sharp rise. Supply as of right now might not be getting better, and thus should also play into July Corn's pricing. These are largely weather based, but starting with...

**Corn Stocks are still trending down**: If you've ever watched Trading Places and wondered if you can make a killing on the [crop report](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/), here's your chance. This is the March 2021 grains report, and the headline is that [Corn stocks are -3% from 2020](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/xg94hp534/db78v700p/7p88db273/grst0321.pdf).

Essentially all the 2020 harvest should be accounted for in December 2020 (harvest for corn is usually Sept - Nov). The demand is almost 250 million bushels more than the similar timeframe from last year. Also remember when looking at the March 2020 data below, that is when gasoline demand and food demand dropped through the floor. We're not going to get any new corn until September, so this summer of relying on what we have still in storage is going to get tight.

https://preview.redd.it/whrhpl4e8zw61.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1c85216ec9a6834a0cf5fb211fc897714b8656b

**Weather pt1 Droughts**: Even though weather this summer won't affect July corn which should already be in storage, inclement weather might force users to bring forward their deliveries, because they won't be sure if their September/December stocks will even be there. Right now, the midwest is starting to see[signs of a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (if you're going to trade this, this site has to become your new bookmarked page). A look at the historical patterns, and you can see more and more of the midwest is [facing inclement drought conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Midwest).

**Weather pt2 Odd Weather Patterns**: Now I haven't read any scholarly articles for this, but doesn't it seem weather is odd this year for most of the country? First the [big winds from last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2020_Midwest_derecho), then the early 2021 [big polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2021_North_American_cold_wave) that made a big V shape, and then sudden warming we're seeing now. I won't be so shocked if some big storm happens this summer to affect the heartland. Corn is very susceptible to storms because the roots are really shallow.

**Weather pt3 Stress**: In any case, the weather so far might be leading to stressed corn. I have some BS11 planted in the middle of Texas, and it's already tasseling without any ears. This may be due to heat and drought conditions, but in any case I've heard farmers' horror stories of having their entire acreage sold for sileage because not one ear grew. Here's a pic of mine. The corn is about 4ft tall right now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g9sgyn7bbzw61.jpg?width=2976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=476caf52a3d8542e8e2048d5e456102d12f9a80d

&#x200B;

**High input costs**: This shouldn't color you shocked, but there's a [fertilizer shortage](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/fertilizer-shortage-ken-ferrie-weighs-fertilizer-issues-spring) going on too. You gotta use that and pesticides. I'm not sure if farmers have calculated this, but there's about at 20% increase in prices. Naturally I hope this means they're not willing to hedge their prices at a lower level (selling into the market), further helping prices go higher.

&#x200B;

**Other considerations**: Corn is an international crop, but most of it is in the US. Brazil and Ukraine should have good planting, but once again that shouldn't affect July because of the supply/demand imbalance. There's also something about a locust infestation in Indiana. But, [plantings are increasing at a brisk pace](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/corn-planting-progress-leaps-29-points-beats-2020s-historic-jump). That might be why prices dropped today which I bought into.

These are my positions. I look forward to keep buying 2-5 contracts at a time and holding towards expiration in 57 days.

n3zybm,,wallstreetbets,post,1620058112,"Why I’m bullish on MVISSo, let me get this straight. We criticized MVIS for having a “large” 2b market cap and so now we all suddenly support Nokia with a market cap of 25.1b? That’s 12x more than MVIS. 

NOK Income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 13,659,000/21,852,000 = 62.5%. This means 62.5% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 37.5% is what the company kept as gross profit. 

MVIS income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 
1,398/3090 = 45.24%. This means 45.24% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 54.76% is what the company kept as gross profit.

All prices listed from income statements are in millions of dollars. Yes Nokia is bringing home more money, but they aren’t raking it in as efficiently as MVIS. Because MVIS is a much much smaller company than NOK, their differences in the dollar amount of gross profit is to be understood. But my original statement still stands, MVIS is “taking home a bigger % of their pie” for profits, because they are better than NOK at mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs. 

Let’s take a look at their D./T.A. Ratio. This will give us insight to which degree debt is used to finance assets for each company. The lower the ratio, the better the company is at using that debt to finance assets.

NOK DTA: 6,486,000/36,191,000 = 17.92%. This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, NOK accumulated $17.92 in debt. 

MVIS DTA: 3,107/21,006 = 14.79% This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, MVIS accumulated $14.79 in debt. 

MVIS does a much better job, as previously stated, at mitigating losses and staying efficient. Not to mention, because MVIS is researching extremely new technology, much of their funding will be for R&D - much more R&D is needed for sensors that didn’t exist a few years ago, over the R&D needed for a new phone or cellular service which has already been around for decades. If MVIS is able to have a lower DTA ratio, developing “new to this world” technology, than a company that has been making phones longer than we’ve been alive, then how is it a bad buy? How is NOK a better buy?

I know typically DDs are not suppose to take into account the comparison between other stocks, but too many of you have fallen into this NOK train that will leave you at a $4.50+ cost basis, and suddenly NOK will start trading sideways at $4.10 for the next coming years, and you’re nah holding. Have fun making 3 cents a share per year. That’s pussy shit I didn’t come here for. 

Not financial advice, I literally failed Finance 304. Professor was an ass.

EDIT: Anyone peep MVIS today? Hahaha damn... definitely doesn’t coincide with some of the “$5 best valuation” comments circling around. 

Anyways thanks for the comments, I’ve learned a lot. Many of you are seriously smart and talented people. Thank you for your input and I wish you all the best!",

n3zybm,gwu4h1r,wallstreetbets,comment,1620079936,"I think you have confused some numbers here. Specifically, when you see ""cost of revenue,"" that does **not** include ""mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs."" It means the cost just of the items that produced the revenue, nothing else.

For 2020, MVIS had total revenue 3.1m, with a cost of 1.4m and thus a gross profit of 1.7m. The ""overhead,"" however, was 15.8m (split as $5.9m general and 9.8m R&D). 

Combine those together and you get gross profit 1.7m *minus* operating expenses of 15.8m for an operating income of -14.1m.

NOK's operating income in 2020 was 2,060.8m. By these measures, NOK blows MVIS out of the water.

Truth is, this isn't a good way to value MVIS anyway. If you are buying MVIS, you are absolutely, totally, completely not buying it based on its current financials. It is not a ""value"" stock, it is a ""growth"" stock.

Usually, when looking at growth stocks, you start with the revenue. You want to see rapid growth of revenue or at least the potential for it.

Over the past five years, MVIS has had revenue per share of $0.28, $0.13, $0.20, $0.08, and	$0.02. This is not inherently a problem, but it is when the stock is trading at $13.86. Pick any number you want from those prior years, this is still a multiple over 50. For the most recent year, it's well above 500.

For comparison, TSLA had a revenue per share of $33.80 last year, and it trades at $684.90. A multiple of 20. (That's high, and more a ""growth"" valuation than a ""value"" one. NOK, for example, has a multiple right around 1. AAPL is around 8. AMZN is around 4.) Still far below MVIS.

Truth is, MVIS already has ""growth"" priced into it. Lots and lots of growth. Like >100% compounded annual growth of revenue. That's a problem for anyone buying now.","['TSLA', 'AAPL', 'AMZN']"
n3zybm,gwsrv46,wallstreetbets,comment,1620059026,"Assuming the bull perspective, the financials are not relevant right now except to note that MVIS has enough money to make it through the end of 2021 when production of their LiDAR should really begin. The rest of the DD should focus on their LiDAR and other verticals and the potential valuation of those going forward. And then it’s just a question of whether you believe MVIS will deliver on their promises.",

**Short Interest**

Short interest on $X is 17% as of today. Citadel is obviously among who’s shorting it.

&#x200B;

**My Plan**

In the last five years this stock almost always rose at least 30% with last year being the first time it dipped a bit. I have no position yet on this stock but a buy order set at $22.50 since friday; I'm confident it will dip following today's sharp 8% rise. You have to decide whether you want to play this for a month or six months, the weekly chart shows that this could probably shoot to $50 by end of year but i’m confident that if people discover about this hidden gem it could do it by mid summer and why not, go even higher. In any case I don’t see this crashing hard since it’s a strong company, and because it has a mid market cap if it runs it will almost certainly not be stopped by a shitty offering.

**Week of 5/3/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.

Manufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit & factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity & labor costs for Q1 release Thursday.

Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...”

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

n44wwz,,wallstreetbets,post,1620069906,"My two favorite recover plays. ASO and CLNEAlright, the weekends now over but that doesn't matter for most of you since Wendy's never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD's. Reading this won't take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your ""grind.""

I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you've either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you're just too retarded to know the tickers. It's fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy. If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet. If you need help download a synthetic voice text-to-speech program and have it read to you. If that still doesn't work, you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help. Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife's boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don't get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom.

First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a total shit show. Academy reported earnings on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 • Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 • Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 • Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an excerpt.

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a 100% buy rating and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16%. Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is 40,436,703 shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to /u/XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

Next one, CLNE (Clean Energy)

""Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles. Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation, and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel.

Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer, healthier planet for all of us. This change is happening. Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world.""

Hmmm, I can't even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time (notably marked by unprecedented climate change) when a company providing an alternative to diesel, especially one that is clean and readily available, could POSSIBLY flourish. I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over $500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day. Looking over the finances, fuel prices accounted for 20% more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis. Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business. We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry. Not that this is entirely related, but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again, exceeded expectations. Amazon's sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent. Why does it matter? Shut the fuck up and keep reading. ""[Clean Energy] signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas, as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations."" Yeah you read that correctly, Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor. It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring.

Also noteworthy.

""UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U.S.

Seven-Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons."" Go look at their press releases if you want to see their other partnerships.

I have attached another DD done by /u/twenty98 about CLNE that was well done. We also know that /u/NrdRage made a very good DD as well so go read it because I'm not going to retype it and in any way attempt to take credit for their work. I am not sitting here saying I love the stock, to be honest, I love the company and what it does. Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me. Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future, alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support. 

I don't really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do, but in my opinion, both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating. CLNE is up 5% for the week and down 22% for the month. For those that figured out MVIS, CLOV and all the other bullshit, the time to buy into something isn't after it's up 120% in two days and Cramer mentions it. Find assets at a less retarded entry point. Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this.

That's the end of the post and that's all I got for you. Now you can return to the act of holding your wife's hair while she goes down on your neighbor! Thank me later.

n45xj8,,wallstreetbets,post,1620072470,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['INTC', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'IP']"
n45xj8,gwtv2k1,wallstreetbets,comment,1620075715,"Response to this.  No position either way. For Intel,   I do know however that as you increase your technode you must increase your equipment technology.  20 B for new Fabs is not an eye shocking number and anyone who knows semiconductor companies knows this.  

Look at the foundry TSMC majority of output is in Taiwan with only 2 8-inch wafer facilities in the USA.   8 inch wafer facilities are money losers, you spend the same amount to produce them as a 12 inch wafer, but netting less chips, industry current standard or 300 mm or 12 inch.  Those fabs wont be around much longer and they will eventually need to be retooled, and most likely completely rebuilt.    

Why building in the USA will be so important in the future.   

Look at Taiwan and Singapore two places China would love to control.  Let's say tensions with China intensify and a skirmish or war breaks out there.   There would be a strangle on a lot of chip manufacturing.  Pay attention to trouble brewing in the south china sea.  

If Intels fabs are up and running they would continue to build un-harrassed in the USA.   

I agree that any time a company takes money for capital expenditures when it is running behind is risky. TSMC IS SPENDING 25 TO 28 BILLION THIS YEAR ON CAPITAL EXPENSES.  Samsung  is spending 28.1 billion this year. The reason Intel is producing more fabrication facilities is so that is can have more capacity which it does not have access to currently.  So the numbers being thrown around are normal for the industry.   

I would have to agree in the short term intel is behind and it will take time for them to get back up.   I do however believe they will be much better positioned going forward.   Their stock already looks discounted. 

Just remember semiconductor companies are always playing texas hold em.   They have to put tons of money upfront and then hope everything works out to stay profitable.   Loss of power, interuptions in supply chain i.e. south china sea, would be devastating to any company producing there.  

The only thing that would push intel higher right now would be an announcement of more capacity,  upgrading to 450 mm wafers, or some new advanced processes that blows away the competition.   They are making more capacity but that yield will be 18 months or more out.  Not a bull or bear hear just my two cents.",['INTC']

4. My position.

# 1. Overview

ViacomCBS Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media conglomerate formed through the merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom on December 4, 2019. The company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately **700 million subscribers in approximately 180 countries, as of 2019.** It comprises of five major units:

&#x200B;

* **CBS Entertainment Group** consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television and CBS Television Stations. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.
* **Domestic Media Networks** encompasses the pay television channels owned by ViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy  Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix.      ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels  listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* **International Networks** encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in  Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in  Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18. This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.
* **Streaming Group** focused on the global over-the-top streaming services and Internet properties. This division encompasses **Paramount+, Pluto TV, CBSN, CBS Sports HQ, BET+ and Noggin**.
* **Global Distribution Group** focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

***Leadership***

ViacomCBS is headed by Robert Bakish.  Bakish holds a Bachelor of Science in operations research from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science and also earned an MBA from Columbia Business School. He has been with Viacom (per-merger enitiy) since February 1997, joining initially as Vice President of Planning and Development.

**Head of international operations:** In January 2007 Bakish became President of MTV Networks International (MTVNI), overseeing all MTV Networks operations outside the U.S. He immediately restructured MTVNI, cutting 8% of the workforce in addition to merging some overseas units with the UK business and devolving responsibilities for Latin American operations to new offices across the region. He launched the popular Colors franchise of networks via the Viacom18 joint venture in the high-growth market of India. MTVNI had double-digit, year-on-year growth during his tenure.

**CEO:** In January 2011, Bakish was promoted to the newly created position of President and CEO of Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN). During his tenure, Bakish expanded Viacom's international footprint, and VIMN was Viacom's most successful division; revenue doubled, and VIMN grew to more than 200 television channels. Under his leadership, the Paramount Channel was launched, offering movies and television shows in Europe, Latin America and Russia. He oversaw the expansion of networks such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Spike to an increasing number of foreign markets, and helped orchestrate the acquisition of Channel 5 in the UK and Telefe in Argentina. He also oversaw the launch of apps, including the Viacom Play Plex suite of branded mobile TV apps and the BET Play direct-to-consumer subscription video-on-demand app for an adult audience.

In October 2016, Bakish was named acting President and CEO of Viacom effective November 15, replacing interim CEO Tom Dooley. Simultaneously, he was also appointed President and CEO of the newly created Viacom Global Entertainment Group, combining Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) with Viacom's Music and Entertainment group, which includes MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Spike TV and Logo TV; two additional networks, TV Land and CMT, also joined the Global Entertainment Group. Optimistic that Bakish could make good on his plans to turn Viacom's core U.S. cable networks and its Paramount Pictures film studio around, the board of directors of Viacom Inc. made Bakish's appointment as President and CEO permanent on December 12, 2016.

In early 2017, **Bakish laid out a five-point plan to turn Viacom around and return the company to steady profitability**. This consisted of focusing on Viacom's six flagship brands: BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Paramount; revitalizing content and talent; deepening distributor and advertiser partnerships to **drive traditional revenue; increasing digital offerings, consumer products and live experiences; and optimizing and energizing the organization**. The strategy also included having Paramount Pictures develop films and franchises connected to Viacom television content; additionally, Spike TV would be rebranded as and converted to a broad-based general entertainment channel, the Paramount Network, in early 2018.

By the fall of 2017 Bakish had restructured Viacom, replacing executives at nearly every company, including hiring Jim Gianopulos - formerly chairman and CEO of 20th Century Fox, as the new chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures.

**In 2018, Bakish's implementation of his five-point comprehensive strategy was credited with Viacom's much improved finances and improved company morale and focus**. In 2018, under Bakish's direction and in accordance with his plan to capture younger and digital markets, Viacom acquired digital platform WhoSay, internet video conference VidCon, and online television network AwesomenessTV. In early 2018, Bakish also announced the launch of an official Viacom streaming service, which will support ads and will include series and content from Viacom that hasn't been available on other streaming services. In April 2018, Viacom launched Viacom Digital Studios, which will create new original content hosted on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. In addition, later that June, Bakish announced that Viacom will produce some new series exclusively for Netflix, beginning with Nickelodeon related content.

Post merger, Bakish swiftly started streamlining and managing operating costs, especially during the pandemic. In May 2020, ViacomCBS initiated a round of post-merger layoffs across all parts of the company but primarily hitting divisions within the CBS Entertainment Group. The was part of a restructuring of various operations at CBS as part of the integration with Viacom, as well as nod to changes in the business including those related to COVID. Bakish has targeted $750 million in synergies from the combination and the company said it had eliminated 450 positions. That has risen as the year progressed. “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, we were already in a period of significant change to integrate our newly combined company – work that is helping us weather this crisis, creatively adapt and strengthen the resiliency of our business,” Bakish wrote. “It’s critical that we continue these efforts to integrate and evolve ViacomCBS to remain competitive now and for the future\*\*.  This means continuing to integrate and streamline our operations, manage our costs as diligently as we can, and follow through on our committed post-merger synergy targets.\*\*”

***Current operations and growth driver***

As noted above, one of the largest pay-TV service providers with a diverse portfolio of network subsidiaries, broadcast rights, and content library for all audience demographics. VIAC generates 37% of its Revenue from CBS (primarily CBS and CW Broadcast stations), 34% from Cable Networks (Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV), 11% from Paramount (movie and TV studio), 8% from Showtime, and 7% from Local Media (Owned and Operated affiliates). In terms of the type of revenue, 40% is advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7pycluoxvsw61.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=70224b7981b50216a101f302b7fbfa7e3a9e32be

Streaming services are the key growth driver for VIAC. Although, the thesis isn't based on VIAC becoming a streaming powerhouse it's important to discuss where they can easily derive growth to exceed expectations. Currently, they operate two platforms PlutoTV and Paramount+. PlutoTV is a free ad-supported streaming TV service. It currently has 43M monthly active users with a management target of 100-120M by 2024. Paramount+ is a more standard streaming platform ($4.99 for ad-supported and $9.99 for premium). It leverages VIAC's deep content library, news subsidiaries, and is differentiated in its offerings of live sports Overall, streaming revenue is $2.6bn with a management target of $7bn by 2024 with 30M current subscribers and management targets of 65-75M subscribers by 2024.

Paramount+ has a very attractive kid-focused value proposition. This [article](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/) discusses the most popular kids' shows in 2021 and the top two are unsurprisingly **Paw Patrol and Spongebob Squarepants which are both owned by VIAC.**

Secondly, there is a differentiated live sports offering with VIAC having signed contracts with numerous major sporting events to be hosted on Paramount+. The service will feature **over 1,000 live sporting events per year**, including regular-season games, playoffs, championships and more across the following marquee properties: *The NFL on CBS,* The Masters, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship, PGA TOUR and Championship, *SEC on CBS,* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League. **Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.**

Management is aggressively focused on investing in growth initiatives leveraged to streaming platforms that are both subscription-supported and advertising-supported (as seen by their $3bn equity raise in late March. More on this in the next section).

VIAC has great streaming potential with significant differentiating features and **currently the market is not pricing in this potential growth.**

VIAC is unique in operating one of four broadcast networks in the United States. This market position enables broad distribution and large/well-diversified audience demographics. While ""cord-cutting"" is a key structural challenge, this business generates cash that can be deployed into growth businesses. **Secondly, the return of the theatrical business will serve as another source of both content and cash generation for VIAC as they continue to reposition their portfolio around streaming.**

***Non-core assets***

Non-core assets being sold is another potential source of significant cash. Some would be sale of CBS' headquarter building (\~$1bn), Simon & Schuster (sold for $2.2bn, expected to close in 2021), and CNET $500mn. **All combined this could potentially raise $3.0-3.5bn in cash.**

# 2. Death of a beached whale

As you all probably know by now, our boy Billy Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks.

By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu.

Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns, but not the actual ownership, of the stock.

By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out. On Monday, March 22, ViacomCBS announced plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal that generated $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans (a very preudent decision by management considering the stock price at the time). Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares. But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. Below are the main points of what happened after:

1. Archegos  was hit with a margin call.
2. Archegos  defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund
3. The  total value of equity exposure was around $20bn
4. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total      return swap
5. Banks were forced to sell their position in large block trades

**3.** **Value Opportunity With Incredible Risk/Reward Asymmetry**

A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world""

\- Seth Klarman, from his book ""Margin of Safety""

The opportunity to buy companies with a significant margin of safety is rare in our current stock market environment. However, ViacomCBS presents a unique value opportunity with the stock down over 58% over a one-month period with no material change in the underlying fundamentals of the company.

VIAC reported solid results in the recent Q4-2020 quarter.

&#x200B;

While the whole focus is on transitioning the company to streaming, the company is doing it from a position of strength. Yes, the whole playbook revolved around the streaming subscribers.

But VIAC was able to generate that growth while also generating tons of free cash flow.

VIAC also repurchased shares at a great price in 2020 and of course used the spike to reissue at a higher price. The proceeds will be used to further bolster Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Netflix achieved its success because of multi-billion-dollar investments in original content, which is a testament to the strong positive correlation between spending on content and subscriber growth. For Paramount+ and Pluto TV to achieve the expected success, ViacomCBS will have to invest substantial amounts in producing high-quality original content and also on securing broadcast rights to live sports events, and it makes sense for the company to raise funds when there is an opportunity in the market. The company has already announced a massive content investment goal through 2024.

Streaming is one of the most competitive, yet fast-growing business segments in the world today. A closer look at recent developments in the industry reveals the presence of a loyal follower base for a brand will not lead to immediate success in the OTT industry. For instance, Apple is struggling to gain market share in the OTT streaming industry although it has a wide follower base and a second-to-none brand value. In contrast, The Walt Disney Company has seen unimaginable success with Disney+. The differentiator is the expertise in content creation and the availability of marketing channels to take the streaming service in front of consumers who are likely to subscribe to a premium subscription service.

ViacomCBS is one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the world, and the company owns some of the most widely followed TV shows and networks. For example, MTV is considered a leading media brand that interacts with the younger population and has a reach of 450 million households in 180 countries. Nickelodeon is another media asset owned by ViacomCBS which has a massive reach. These media assets, the brand value associated with these networks, and the past success of the company in creating content that attracted millions of viewers, will all play an important role in the success story of Paramount+ and Pluto TV.

In 2020, Pluto TV, the ad-supported streaming television service, reported 43 million monthly active users, and I believe MAUs will continue to grow at a stellar pace in the next five years.

&#x200B;

[  Global Pluto TV MAUs](https://preview.redd.it/na560vmtwsw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b5511fc46880a1046f93209e3b0576874bde7fe)

One of the major hurdles to success faced by the subscription-based OTT content streaming industry in emerging markets is the unwillingness of many consumers to pay a monthly fee to watch premium content. This has a lot to do with the median income levels as well. Because of this characteristic, the illegal pirate video services industry continues to thrive in high-growth regions such as Brazil, India, and many other Asian and Latin American nations. According to a recent study by Mint, India's OTT industry loses up to 30% of revenue to pirate video service providers. Pluto TV is primed for growth in international markets because of its ad-supported model as a result of the favorable demographics for this industry in emerging markets, which will be a catalyst for ViacomCBS's growth in the coming years.

Considering the growth opportunities available in the streaming industry, I believe the company management is correct in raising funds to meet the content investment requirements. As the streaming services gain traction, I am confident of a significant expansion in valuation multiples similar to what happened with Disney stock. As long as Disney remained a traditional media company, the company's shares traded at reasonable valuation multiples. However, the decision to restructure the business last October in a bid to prioritize Disney+ sent the stock soaring to new highs because of the positive sentiment of investors toward the OTT streaming industry. In the coming months, I expect a similar expansion in valuation multiples for ViacomCBS stock as well, along with the steady progress the company is expected to make in prioritizing the direct-to-consumer business.

A little over a year after Viacom and CBS merged, the company showcased an aggressive streaming strategy that includes relaunching CBS All Access as Paramount Plus on March 4, with a content pipeline that combines live sports, breaking news and a massive movie library as well as original films and series for the platform. The company also plans to leverage Pluto TV as a way to attract viewers to Paramount Plus.

“When it comes to streaming, we stand for something unique – an ecosystem of free, pay and premium streaming, underpinned in pay by the new Paramount Plus service,” said CEO Bob Bakish\*\*, adding that ViacomCBS nearly tripled its global streaming subscriber base and more than doubled its streaming subscription revenue over the past two years\*\*. “It’s a streaming service that will resonate with broad and diverse audiences and has a robust slate of originals which will only grow.”

The company had a stronger-than-expected Q4, due in large part to the shift to streaming. The company reached a milestone with global streaming subscribers reaching nearly 30 million across its streaming platforms which include CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and BET Plus\*\*. Domestic streaming subscribers was up 71% to 19.2 million YoY.\*\*

Meanwhile, Pluto TV – which Viacom acquired in early 2019 for $340 million – clinched 43 million global monthly active users and 30.1 million domestic MAUs. **Pluto TV also closed new global distribution agreements with Samsung and Google.**

**Global streaming and digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888 million in Q4, driven by 74% growth in streaming subscription revenue and 69% streaming advertising revenue growth.**

**Total revenue increased 3% YoY to $6.8 billion in Q4 and the company took in $1.08 billion in operating income. Advertising revenue increased 4% YoY to $3.1 billion in the quarter, mainly due to the growth of streaming and political advertising in Q4.**

Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra said ViacomCBS ended 2020 with $2.6 billion in global streaming subscription and advertising revenue – **with an annual run rate of $3.6 billion – exceeding the company’s expectations.** He added that ViacomCBS has a goal of reaching 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers – mainly through Paramount Plus – and more than $7 billion in streaming revenue by 2024.

**The new service includes more than 30,000 TV episodes and films such as “The Godfather” and “The Brady Bunch” as well as content from CBS, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and the Smithsonian Channel.**

**Paramount Plus will also debut original movies, series and documentaries, and ViacomCBS is investing aggressively in content to support the growth of its streaming services. ViacomCBS invested $15 billion on content last year, and streaming content expenses will increase to at least $5 billion by 2024**.

“We came up with the pricing strategy because we wanted to serve the greatest addressable audience – which we thing the two tiers does,” said Tom Ryan, president and CEO of streaming at ViacomCBS, who also co-founded Pluto TV. “Also, the two-tiers allow us to drive both subscription and advertising revenue. The $4.99 tier gives us greater flexibility in how we go to market with distribution partners.”

That lower tier still has a lot more content than CBS All Access had. The $9.99 plan has no ads and also has more live sports – including NFL football, the UEFA Champions League, PGA Tour and more – and breaking news, **both of which the execs said is rare in streaming.**

“Right now, we think those are the best price points to go to market with and they’re clearly very competitive in each of their respective lanes,” Ryan said.

Unlike HBO Max, which announced in December that it would release its slate of films simultaneously in theaters and streaming, ViacomCBS said it is committed to the theatrical experience, though the typical 90-day window before a theatrical release is available to buy or rent will be much shorter. **Major films such as “A Quiet Place Part 2” and “Mission Impossible 7” will be available on Paramount Plus 45 days after hitting theaters.**

The company also remains committed to free ad-supported TV. **Pluto TV is on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business and is the top free ad-supported streaming service in the United States with the largest distribution footprint in AVOD.** By the end of 2024, Pluto TV is expected to have between 100 million and 120 million monthly active users globally.

“Pluto TV hasn’t just proven our skeptics wrong, we pioneered a new category and now we’re one of the free leading television services,” Ryan said. “Our ad partners love Pluto because we offer the best of both worlds – the efficient targeting of digital with the brand building and storytelling of traditional TV.”

Pluto TV helps create a “super funnel” that expands the company’s paid services, Ryan said, in part by featuring pilot episodes or past seasons of a show before a new season airs.

**“Once they’re hooked, we offer a trial subscription for more,” he said. “With Pluto’s free linear experience, we can effortlessly introduce tens of millions of viewers to the amazing content we’ve highlighted.”**

**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**

**Paramount+ launch:** After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.

**June pricing change:** In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.

**Improving original content slate:** As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.

**Improving advertising trends:** As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.

**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**

Note also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers, **beating Disney+, Hulu and Netflix.**

Also, according to this [article](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/viac-stock-worth-21-percent-more-using-free-cash-flow/) by InvestorPlace:

“Last year, ViacomCBS made $1.891 billion in free cash flow (FCF), according to the company’s earnings release. However, that included a large negative FCF result of -$453 million for Q4 2020. That implies that the FCF for the first 9 months of 2020 was $2.344 billion.

This is why I believe that the Q1 2021 results will show a huge turnaround in FCF. The same thing happened last year.

Back in Q1 2020, FCF was $305 million, a turnaround from Q4 2019 when it was at -$629 million. Fiscal year 2019 ended up with a positive FCF of $826 million, despite the hit during the fourth quarter.

So, this must be a seasonal thing about negative FCF during Q4. In fact, looking at the numbers for Q4 2020 even more closely, it included a total of $388 million in one-time losses on sales of assets. That would have come close to covering most of the -$453 million in FCF during Q4 2020. **This is another reason why I believe that Q1 will show a major turnaround in free cash flow**.”

**Recent Price Targets for VIAC:** Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70

**My 100K position (all in):**

**TL;DR: VIAC is severely undervalued and could present a fantastic turn around play for 2021. Buy LEAPS or shares.**

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

n3h2gh,,wallstreetbets,post,1619992814,"Clover Health - A mini DD on $CLOV 

&#x200B;

Get clover health ($CLOV) …. Why you ask?

&#x200B;

Lets break it down:

This was a Chamath SPAC at $10 … and then went to $17…. Okay good stuff.

Then some shit short selling report from Hidenburg research came out accusing them of some bad practices and a DOJ investigation.  That shit was overhyped and short sellers jumped on that and started shorting…. They shorted it down to about 7 bucks, that was a hella bargain price to get in it. Lots of companies get summoned to provide information by the DOJ, its really not a big deal, but was overhyped.

Now this company is legit.  Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurer that combines technology and preventive care to lower costs and increase the quality of life. 

&#x200B;

\- They have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive.

\- Biden and democrats are looking to lower the medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.

\- Short interest is above 35% … so yes possible squeeze potential too.

\- Board of directors has got Chelsea Clinton on it, and she is obviously tight with the democratic party. 

\- They moved earnings up…. Which is usually a good sign.

\- There are 360k calls expiring on May 21, and earnings are a couple days before on May 17th. (only 56k puts, so the call to put ratio is pretty damn high)

&#x200B;

This has got some real potential to double by earnings, maybe even more.

 I got in a bit late and bought high, dont be me and get in early on monday!

Position: 4531 shares at $10.72 - and (16) May 21st, $11 call options. Link to position proof.

**The highlights of this analysis are as follows:**

* The management has changed the business model of GoPro into a more DTC business. 
* GoPro's subscription side of their business had 55% QoQ and 145% YoY growth rates.
* GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model.
* The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly (consumer electronics, photographic equipment, and action camera's)
* GoPro's main competition is DJI, Akaso, and Garmin (especially in the action camera market)

**Investment Plan:**

* Buy between $10-14 and hold long-term (until it reaches fair value)
* Sell if the stock falls below $10.49
* Look for re-entry at $8.80-$9.20 (if stock falls below $10.49 and you sell)

**Stocks Fair Value:**

Using a DCF (as seen in the analysis below), GoPro has an estimated share value of $39.12, this implies a potential upside of 248.35%. 

If you  follow my advice above there is only a 6.59% downside risk before selling and re-entry, this makes the risk-to-reward of my trading strategy very favourable.

# Analysis

**Company Overview:**

GoPro manufactures and sells cameras, drones, and other filming/photography accessories. Their main products consist of the HERO7, HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras, and a MAX 360-degree waterproof camera. The HERO 9 camera is the best-selling camera in the US digital market. GoPro also offers cloud-based storage solutions that enables customers to access, edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro’s cameras. GoPro also offers camera protection plans (GoPro Care) and video editing applications (Quik).

GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors/distributors, as well as through their own e-commerce store. GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014, and since its IPO has fallen by over 31%.

GoPro has a TTM revenue of $891.9M, a TTM EBITDA of -$22.6M and a market cap of 1.719B. Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N/A, putting a value on this company is difficult.

Recently, GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this. GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer (DTC) approach in their business model, this has led them to scale back on spending, sales and marketing expenditures, and office space. Furthermore, the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition. This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future.

Investment Information:

**Company and Financial Information:**

GoPro has 3.2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms. This exposure can be leveraged to market their products, and gain product awareness at a significant discount. Furthermore, they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made.

GoPro’s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52% QoQ, and 145% YOY. This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company.

GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021, these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model, increase the DTC component of their business, and grow their gross margins from 36% to 38-40%.

GoPro has 771,000 subscribers to their subscription service, charging an annual fee of $49.99. This amounts to their subscription service bringing in $38.54M last year.

Furthermore, GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package.

GoPro’s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be $68M at FYE 2020. This results in a 24.57x EBITDA multiple, this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report.

**Industry Information:**

GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market, which is valued at $1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7% between 2020-2026. By 2026 (incorporating current industry trends) the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at $1.5T, with 70% of the market being from audio and visual segments, both of which are segments of GoPro’s business.

Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at $22B and is expected to grow at a 5.78% CAGR for the next 6 years. This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Samsung, however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly, giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry.

Lastly, GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3.5B and is expected to grow at a 14% CAGR until 2026. By this time, the industry is expected to be valued at $5.5B.

By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within, we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to determine the fair value share price.

**Competition:**

DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras. Recently, they have launched their very first action camera, the Osmo Action, which is supposed to compete with GoPro’s HERO7. The Osmo Action has a front-facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7.

Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures. Recently, they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro. The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro, however it comes in at a cheaper price point, and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro.

Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation, automotive, marine, outdoor and sport activities. Garmin’s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera, is similar to many GoPro models, shooting video in up to 4K, with similar size and weight to that of GoPro. The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and altimeter, which may be attractive for some consumers.

**Investment Plan and Valuation:**

Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA, we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company. Instead, we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share.

Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of $39.12. The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on, and if GoPro’s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries.

With that being said, the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience. By looking at their current management and their backgrounds, it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years, and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience. This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro, I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future.

For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro. If you can buy the shares in the $10-14 range, you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return. If you buy at current prices $11.23, I recommend holding unless the stock falls below $10.49, if this happened, I would sell and look for a re-entry at $8.80-9.20, then hold long term.
