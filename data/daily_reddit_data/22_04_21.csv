LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has been named as a supplier on the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) Back Office Software (BOS) RM6194 Framework.

The BOS Framework is a new CCS framework to provide a route to market for organisations wishing to purchase software subscriptions and licence support for back office systems direct from software vendors. It is available to all central government departments and all other public sector bodies, including local authorities, health, police, fire and rescue, education and devolved administrations.

All of Palantir’s software as a service (SaaS) products, including Palantir Foundry’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Suite, are available via the BOS Framework to optimise back office functions. Palantir’s products power data-driven operational decision making within and across organisations, allowing both technical and non-technical users to leverage complex data environments to make informed decisions.

Palantir has helped power the NHS’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to delivering significant value and enhancements across other UK government departments including the Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence.

This award indicates Palantir’s increased investment and presence in the UK and the multiple uses its software has for its government customers. The BOS Framework adds to the list of CCS and UK government frameworks which can already be used to purchase Palantir’s SaaS products.",

mvqn7a,gve00zo,stocks,comment,1619050634,">“We want to be part of the business community in Europe,” he said. “Selling some of our vehicles to make some money is not our ultimate goal.”

So, the goal isn't making money from European operations but rather being a part of the European business community and they'll just open one showroom in one country in September?

This plan appears to be less a plan to conquer the European market and more of a marketing exercise to boost their image in the Chinese market. 

It's actually a good idea, if so. Europe is 44 countries with different tastes, laws and languages. It's consistently rejected non-European premium brands. Europeans don't want American or Japanese premium brands - Cadillac and Infiniti both gave up and withdrew from Europe a few years ago - so it's doubtful there's much market for a Chinese premium brand. A full scale launch of a Chinese premium brand in Europe would be a costly fool's errand, but selling just a few cars through a minor operation would be good for Nio's image as Europe is well-regarded by middle class Chinese consumers. 

Another Chinese start-up, Qoros, did something similar a few years ago. They hyped a European launch, presented their cars to European regulators which received 5 star safety ratings. Then they opened a single showroom, and that was it. But it allowed them to tell Chinese consumers that European regulators like their cars and Europeans are buying their cars - even if just very small numbers from a single location.",

mvi51b,,stocks,post,1619018934,"Why P/E ratios are not as high as they actually seem  

If you take a look at average P/E ratios of stocks you will recognize, that most of them seem pretty high right now. When I started investing years ago, I learned some rule of thumb that a P/E over 15 is where a stock starts to get expensive - I know it depends on the type of stock, as growth stocks always have higher P/Es. But I want to point out where the 15 came from: 

&#x200B;

In times with normal interest rates (e.g. year 2000) you got 5-6 % interests on your bank account – risk free. So if you would have put 10.000$ on your account, after 15 years (by compound interest) you would have gained about 10.000$. So in the world of stocks your bank account would have had a P/E of **15** (!). So there was some good reason needed to invest in a company that gains less earnings than your bank account could do. 

  

At the moment my bank account has a P/E of 278, but we still asses P/Es the same way. In years with QE and a something like 0.25% interests this doesn’t makes too much sense for me anymore. Therefore all that comparison of the P/E of the 2000 bubble doesn’t sound very plausible while taking interest rates into account.  

&#x200B;

So maybe we should keep in mind that cheap or expensive has also something to do with the alternatives you have (and actually there are almost zero).",['ES']
mvi51b,gvca40y,stocks,comment,1619023106,"You are spot on! The term “cost of capital” is the cost of the “alternative” in most economic theories. 

Also, you will be very interested in the Fed Model: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_model, which states what you are saying -> P/E should be compared to the interest rate of the economy (they actually use inverted P/E, called earnings yield)

Congratulations for setting your daughters up for success! You have the right mindset and you will find success.
I know I’m a stranger on the internet and I can claim to be anyone. I’m sure you will get plenty of good advice here and you will also listen to other professionals give their opinions on the media or read articles that suggest you do this or that.... which eventually makes you feel overwhelmed and confused because you’re flooded with contrasting information.
This is how this industry works and makes money off of misinformation, chaos and tapping into a “little” greed that all of us human beings have 😁😉
The simple answer to your question is: Buy an index fund with all US stocks and buy a second index fund with all international stocks. This will make sure your daughters will get their share of returns from the success of businesses all over the world. 

The art of successful investing is really your ability to control your emotions, make little mistakes and hold on to your wealth (not letting others eat away your returns little by little without you noticing). 
For your peace of mind, I want you to take the time and strength to STUDY a book by the legendary Jack C. Bogle called “The Little Book on Common Sense Investing”. That book will teach you up why investing is a winner’s game that guarantees you successful wealth-building tools while picking stocks/ mutual funds/ ETFs (aka hottest trends) is a loser's game that guarantees your greed will make others richer because of the mistakes you unavoidably make. 

Good luck to you! I wish you the very best in your investment journey! 🙋🏾‍♂️🤝",

""As it seems, Musk thought the number of employees in Grünheide then a little too big. Business Insider learned from government circles that internally the number of a maximum of 12,000 employees is expected - and for many years. Previously, it was said that 12,000 employees would be employed in expansion stage 1 of the factory. And this number would then gradually increase. Not even the well-meaning members in the state government believe in that.""

mvozqy,,stocks,post,1619037870,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 21, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 21, 2021**

Stocks reversed on Monday, rising on Wednesday for the first day in three sessions, with small-caps leading the way after a terrible run of performance in April. Despite Netflix (NFLX) sharply missing earnings expectations in terms of new paid subscribers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), while the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) remain near record levels. 

After a recent spike this week, the CBOE Volatility Index sank back to near 52-week lows, a sign that investor risk appetite is increasing. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.”

While Netflix (NFLX) sharply missed estimates, this earnings season has largely blown consensus estimates out of the water, with more than 81% of companies that have reported so far beating earnings expectations, according to a study by FactSet. However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks (apart from today) have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies. 

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.
* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). 
* Ford Motor (F) is planning more downtime at five North American factories due to a global semiconductor shortage. 
* During yesterday’s virtual event, Apple (AAPL) announced a new slate of products set to include the companies own chip. The offering includes a new iMac, a new iPad, and a new tracking-device called Airtags.
* Gisele Bündchen, supermodel and Tom Brady’s wife was announced as a special advisor for the CEO and board of directors in DraftKings. This is just the latest in a series of high-profile moves by DraftKings to establish itself as the premier sport-betting company. 
* After gapping up after earnings, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) joined the ranks of healthcare companies worth $100 billion or more
* After a series of high profile accidents including small children, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission advised consumer to not buy the treadmill if there are small kids or pets at home.This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector. In response, Peloton (PTON) called the statements “inaccurate and misleading” and refused calls to recall their treadmill. The stock has been in freefall this week.

I am thinking of drafting up my ideal portfolio for myself and I would love some advice considering I am quite young and inexperienced!  


For context, I am a very young investor with a high risk tolerance wishing for heavy exposure in technology with hope for high growth. For this reason, this is what I am thinking:

VOO (30%)

VXUS (20%)

ESPO (15%)

ARKK (15%)

Other Individual Stocks(20%)

Firstly, is my portfolio too risky with a high exposure to technology? Should I be rebalancing it to increase my position in the indexes? (I know I will be able to stomach large volatility/drops)

Secondly, I am worried about too much fund overlap considering I have many ETFs/Indexes. Should this be a worry? Especially considering the expense ratios. (However, from what I can tell, there isn't a lot with ESPO and ARKK at least)

You probably want just a general growth ETF (assuming you want growth), something you can just keep averaging down in over a long period and you know it will recover eventually. But if that half is just play money and you want to make more of a gamble on the market continuing to run up, then that might be a good split between safe long term investments and YOLOs.

* Revenue: $7.16 billion, vs $7.13 billion expected  (up 24% YOY)

“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.

When asked about their view on competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix responded: “We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions,”

“As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises,” 

Netflix also approved a buyback program to repurchase up to $5 billion in common stock, beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. That’s expected to begin this quarter, the company said.

The bad is their stock price is about where it was 5 years ago and 10 years ago. I’d rather have a growing company. Their earnings have also been on a downward trend over the last few years so you can only get so much dividend out of that. 

In tech IBM cloud is a joke. They will not be able to compete long term against the hyperscale CSPs. I think that’s why Krishna is spinning off their infra business. I do think they have a future as a custom solutions provider that uses cloud.

Quantum is a long ways off, I’m pretty biased but I also don’t see IBM a winner in this category because - riddle me this, what was the last technology IBM grabbed by the horns and took a leading position in? It was mainframes under Lou Gerstner nearly 30 years ago. No way their more agile competitors are going to let quantum go to IBM. Just look at how they did with Watson.

Anyways, I personally don’t touch IBM and that is probably my internal biases working against me because I’m in tech. However, I genuinely have been impressed by Krishna so far.

mw1i6k,,stocks,post,1619086067,"$TELL Tellurian founded by legend Charif SoukiPosted about TELL in a different sub (pennystocks) and was discouraged by the amount of people that questioned if i was a bot or my motivations for the post. 

****Full transparency: I YOLOed $TELL and was down 100k at Tuesdays 1.62 low. Im down about 66k right now after yesterdays pop. Sitting on 120k shares and holding for the long haul. TELL is the only stock i own (all in) so it is the only stock I post about. ****

***CONSIDERING SUCH, TAKE WHAT I SAY BELOW FOR WHATEVER YOU THINK IT’S WORTH. ****

IMO, this stock has some serious upside potential as an investment. The investment premise centers around the company being successful on a Nat Gas Liquefaction project called Driftwood. 

Company was founded by a big thinker legend named Charif Souki.  Look him up. He is an interesting character who has lived an incredibly successful life. 

Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to shrink it down to 1/600 the size by turning it into a liquid. LNG can then be shipped (particularly to Europe and Asia where nat gas prices are very high). Exporting LNG from US to Europe and Asia allows for the seller to take advantage of the arbitrage caused by low Nat Gas prices in US and high prices in Europe and Asia. Souki basically created the US LNG export industry when he founded Cheniere Energy. 

US LNG exports are continuing to increase and demand from Asia is set to substantially increase in the decades to come. Many of us in developed countries forget (or dont know) what it is like in developing countries. Half of the world burns Coal or animal biomass as a heat source. Terrible co2 emissions and pollution. Nat gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. Renewables like solar and wind are not practical in much of the world (cost, infrastructure, reliability, etc). Like it or not, the world is looking at nat gas as the future (at least for the next few decades). 

If TELL is successful with building the Driftwood project, it would generate about $5 free cash flow per share annually. I don’t care what boring multiple you slap on that, it implies a substantial share price $40-60? The stock is currently trading at $1.92 after popping off of a TA support level of 1.70ish (old resistance). Price spiked up to over $4 on no news earlier this yr. If TELL gives the market a better indication of driftwood status through a PR, the share price will explode up. Well past $4. Im shocked that the buyers are not piling in at this level considering the risk/reward relationship. 

LNG fundamentals are solid, the company has a great business model and recently paid down almost all debt, and the management team is the best in the world (most experienced LNG team without question). My money (all of it) is on them making Driftwood a success. Wish I had more to double down when it was at $1.70 the other day. My average is $2.46. I think my current open loss is a short term problem. If the project is a success, there is some massive upside. 

Recognizing that this is a volatile stock that has potential to be a nearly complete loss (if Driftwood is not a success), I still think that the risk/reward relationship is amazing at this level. Personally, i put driftwood success at a 50/50. Basically a coinflip. Heads you lose 1000 tails you win 20,000? I’m taking that bet any day of the week. 

I am not planning on selling anytime soon and would only do so if the fundamental picture somehow majorly changed. I am sharing this here just simply to spread the word about the company and what I believe is a very promising future. Short interest has also increased recently and the stock could see a squeeze. TELL founder and chairman actually addressed this very issue in a video on tues. 

Good luck with your positions everyone!",

I'll offer a counterpoint. Shipping stuff around in Europe is not particularly convenient, you incur in recurring costs that are mostly avoided via buying gas from Russia using the already existing pipelines. In fact Nord Stream 2 will arrive rather soonish (and I'd wager the December spike of TELL has not been due to ""no news"" like you implied but due to Nord Stream 2 [sanctions news from US to Germany](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2173670-us-congress-authorizes-new-nord-stream-2-sanctions)).

All and all I don't see any way in which this market will expand to Europe. I'd rather wager it's going for some well calculated pumps with Driftwood and then disappear forever in the coming years.

>Nat gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. Renewables like solar and wind are not practical in much of the world (cost, infrastructure, reliability, etc). Like it or not, the world is looking at nat gas as the future (at least for the next few decades).

Yeah, no. In fact natural gas is quite more finicky to come by when you are not connected to a pipeline while solar is definitely growing several times more than natural gas, even more so if the plan of developed nations is to cut on fossil fuel. We can discuss on how much natural gas will be affected in comparison to oil and fracking but predicting decades of growth for natural gas? that's a lobbyist' wet dream.

>If TELL is successful with building the Driftwood project, it would generate about $5 free cash flow per share annually. I don’t care what boring multiple you slap on that, it implies a substantial share price $40-60?

A share price of 50$ would take the company market cap to 19B$. That's half of ENI market cap. You have no idea what you are talking about.

>LNG fundamentals are solid, the company has a great business model and recently paid down almost all debt, and the management team is the best in the world (most experienced LNG team without question).

The fundamentals are the worst I have seen in months. The debt/equity ratio is 120, operating cash flow is -69M - cash share, book value per share less than 1, the operating income for last year is an estimated -166M (which also was due to paying down the debt I guess) and for the last quarter -2M, it has not been profitable last year, the year before or the year before that.

>Recognizing that this is a volatile stock that has potential to be a nearly complete loss (if Driftwood is not a success), I still think that the risk/reward relationship is amazing at this level. Personally, i put driftwood success at a 50/50. Basically a coinflip. Heads you lose 1000 tails you win 20,000? I’m taking that bet any day of the week.

This stock is not a coin flip, this is a divorce stock. This is the stock people divorces over and that wives shows to the judge to convince him that their ex husband is not alright.

While I don't dream to much about finding one, I really think that the next short squeeze can bring me good profits. And that is what I am really searching for. Today I choose to invest in two companies that are ripe for squeezing.  

Discovery Communications $DISCA saw an extreme drop at the end of March this year, after more than doubling in the first three months. The problem was with the brokers of Archegos Capital Management liquidating their positions in it.

But, after this correction shares at today’s prices (around $37 per share) are reasonably priced, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 13x. With earnings per share (EPS) set to rise by around 14.6% between 2021 and 2022, this company remains in growth mode, as the subscriber base of streaming offerings such as Discovery+ remains on the rise.

At the current situation, I believe that by buying DISCA stock you’re getting a growing business, at an attractive valuation, coupled with the potential for a massive rip, if those betting against it start unwinding their positions.

Root $Root is one of the most innovative insurance companies out there that debuted last year. Over the past six months its price tumbled from $27 to around $10 because of the short sellers that believe it to be overvalued or don't understand its industry. The business model and the technology this company uses to price insurance makes it an ideal candidate to disrupt the insurance industry. Similar to what Lemonade did at its time. Some analysts suggest that the price of $ROOT will touch $9, but I am willing to take the risk at $10. I will put it in my portfolio and forget about it for the next couple of years. With 39% of its shares sold short, it won't take much to turbocharge it. With so many betting against it, the odds of it popping on a squeeze likely exceed its chances of falling far into the single-digits. 

Good luck everyone!",['DISCA']
mvm368,,stocks,post,1619029801,"$EGLX - The Best Opportunity in eSportsI am bringing word from Canada about one of our favourite stocks that just uplisted to the Nasdaq today: **Enthusiast Gaming. (EGLX)**

This company has made us a lot of money eh.

I am here to tell you why I seriously think it is the BEST opportunity to make money in eSports stocks on the market.

# But the #1 thing you have to understand is that they are not in the business of winning gaming championships. They are INFLUENCER MARKETERS with a laser focus on gaming and eSports.

Here are some highlights for why you should check it out:

**1) Solid leadership.** They were founded by the owners of the Vancouver Canucks NHL team after the DOTA world championship was hosted in the Canucks stadium. The CEO (Adrian Montgomery) says the championship sold out the stadium with a single tweet and it was like Woodstock for gamers. They decided then and there that eSports was the future and they wanted in. He left the Canucks and now runs EGLX full time.

Source: [https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/the-case-for-getting-in-the-game/](https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/the-case-for-getting-in-the-game/)

**2) Very fast growing revenue.** While most eSports stocks are just a bunch of empty hype, EGLX is the real deal. The money is there and it's growing fast. As per their last earnings report, they grew their annual revenue from $15m to $127m in just 12 months.

Source: [https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/](https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/)

**3) Growing profit margins.** The earnings call also outlined that their losses are narrowing and they have drastically increased their revenue per user. RPV (revenue per viewer) was $0.52 in the last quarter, an increase of 100% from $0.26 in Q3 2020

Source: [https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/](https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/)

**4) Huge deals with real leaders.** EGLX has been taking off lately largely in part because of their announcements that they have been securing deals with huge clients. Clients such as:

* TikTok (*Undisclosed amount 7 figure marketing deal*)
* Samsung (*Official sponsorship of Luminosity*)
* US Air Force
* The Biden Harris Campaign
* Ubisoft
* Burger King
* and many more.
* (The CEO has also indicated they are currently responding to 7 figure RFPs and there could be more announcements soon.)

These are mostly marketing sales contracts, but with the Biden Harris deal it has never been explicitly stated (but heavily insinuated) that they facilitated AOC playing Among Us on twitch.

**5) TONS of diverse gaming assets.** EGLX should be thought of as an umbrella corporation that manages a massive pile of grassroots gaming channels, streamers, websites and teams. Their assets include:

* **7 eSports team licenses** in leagues managed by the biggest gaming companies:  

   * Valorant (Riot)
   * Call of Duty (ATVI)
   * Apex (EA)
   * Fortnite (Epic Games)
   * Overwatch (ATVI)
   * Madden (EA)
* **Like 100 fan websites** all delivering paid ad content. Some notable sites:  

   * IcyVeins (Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo guides)
   * FextraLife (Dark Souls and Souls like guides)
   * Sims Resource (Sims is the most female dominated AAA game in the world)
* **Several of the world's leading streamers and youtubers**  

   * xQc - The BIGGEST twitch streamer on Earth
   * Pokimane - The second biggest female gaming youtuber on Earth
   * and a bunch of other big names like Tyler1 and several other pro League of Legends players
* They are currently working on making a new ""one stop shop"" **eSports publication called UpComer**
* It has been hinted in past calls that they would like to make their own ""social platform for gamers"" one day.
* Their connection with the Vancouver Canucks, and therefore the Rogers Place stadium is a HUGE benefit. Which other eSports orgs have **unlimited access to a stadium**?
* Last and probably least, the also host the biggest Canadian gaming convention each year named EGLX. This is basically the PAX/e3 of Canada. It's not a big deal for the stock, but I think it's still kind of a cool little bonus.

**6) Ridiculously large social reach.** Last quarter they officially had **1\*\*\*\*0 BILLION TOTAL VIEWS**. In March their Luminosity eSports teams were the most popular teams across all of twitch.

**7) Relatively underpriced.** Enthusiast gaming is **ONLY TRADING AT ABOUT $920m USD market cap** right now. That's really almost nothing for a company growing this fast, doing $127m in annual revenue, in what is likely one of the next big emerging industries.

# ... and no I don't mean eSports is the upcoming industry. I mean INFLUENCER MARKETING.

\--

Finally, I want to discuss what I believe is the biggest risk to this company: loss of talent. Whenever the undisclosed contracts that streamers like xQc and Pokimane have with EGLX dry up, what's to stop them from going to a different agency?

My comfort with that risk is two fold:

1. The former CEO of a professional NHL hockey team knows a lot more about agent contracts then any streamer. This guy has worked with this exact same problem with professional NHL players in the past. I am sure he is being smart about the contracts and non-competition agreements etc.
2. I believe EGLX just needs to get to the stage of brand recognition that they can make stars and they don't need to find stars. They are in fact already trying to do this. Last fall they launched their ""RISING STARS"" program which is basically America's Got Talent for gaming.

It seems perfectly sensible to me that the influencer marketing and eSports space will soon be dominated by professional corporate agencies, not a bunch of freelance youtubers who have to take care of all their own admin, video editing, marketing, sales, etc etc.

I genuinely believe this stock is the BEST opportunity to capitalize on that trend.","['ATVI', 'NDAQ', 'EA']"

Doubt it, pretty much every major YouTuber/Streamer got that way through some serious consistency and a lack of payoffs for the first few years. By the time they would be profitable for the agency they wouldn’t need them anymore and I don’t see how a marketing agency would do anything for a streamer that a streamer couldn’t have one of their mods or viewers do. 

They’d have to generate profit by taking on a shit ton of new talent in the hopes one blows up similar to how Barstool does with Podcasts. 

But twitch already does this, streamers can create their own orgs without paying 10% to some agency. Look at any of those orgs, even though one streamer in it may average 70k viewers, the others all cruise between 200-500 because they are boring. 

Assuming eventually one of their recruits blows up, they’d have to hold onto them to generate profit, except if they blew up they wouldn’t need the agency anymore because it’s not like acting, sports or music where they are going to move through roles. 

Also seems like there’d be a shit ton of red tape, Twitch banning people for simple TOS violations is one of the biggest grievances most streamers have with twitch. You really think profitable streamers are going to want more red tape from sponsors they don’t choose because said sponsors are contracted through the agency? What games they have to play, what they can and cannot do, when they have to stream, etc. sounds like a really good way to either burn out from producing content or die out in profitably from selling out.

Which leads to the next issue, selling out. If there’s anything viewers hate, it’s sellouts, look at ninja, guy made more money than any content producer in history but he sold out, signed a shit ton of contracts, lost touch with his viewers and his average viewer base is a fraction of what it once was.

I just don’t see it being a sustainable business model

Just someone’s 2 cents who’s been a part of esports and YouTube, then twitch, since 2008. Maybe I’m wrong and it’s genius, but I don’t see it.",

mvfgk3,,stocks,post,1619010994,"$12.3 Trillion in Stimulus Killed the Debt Default CycleCE Bank of America index data show. Investors have raced one another to lend billions of dollars to cruise companies and airlines even as they bleed cash. The amount of U.S. junk-rated debt included in the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield bond index has surged to a record face value of $1.53 trillion from $1.2 trillion in October 2019.

“Ratings agencies have become comfortable with higher and higher leverage, thus companies are more and more happy to take advantage of it,” Noel Hebert, director of credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a recent article. “There’s an incentive to hold leverage at elevated levels because there’s no real mechanism that’s punishing you.”

It’s easy to look at these valuations paired with more leveraged balance sheets and say risk is being mispriced. Some companies will default, perhaps unexpectedly, even if credit seems priced to perfection now. And yet these yields and low perceived risk of default make perfect sense. In fact, there’s a case for some of these bond yields to go lower.

First, cheap borrowing costs help companies stay alive longer and more easily. That’s a big part of the reason Fitch Ratings just dropped its expected U.S. junk-bond default rate for 2021 to 2%, the lowest since 2017, and doesn’t see it rising much more from that in 2022. About $90 billion of distressed debt was trading as of April 16, down from almost $1 trillion in March 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Second, government officials have flooded the global economy with cash at an unprecedented pace. Monetary and fiscal stimulus for just the U.S. could have amounted to $12.3 trillion from February 2020 through March 2021, according to Cornerstone Macro Research data posted on the Wall Street Journal’s Daily Shot.

That’s a lot of money, leaving a lot of cash sitting in savings accounts and looking for assets to buy. Perhaps some investors feel it’s better to invest it with a company that actually makes something or provides real services than, say, a cryptocurrency started as a joke. 

The more important question perhaps isn’t whether this is a bubble that will pop soon but rather what are the consequences of this era of free-flowing cash. It prevents the dissolution of businesses that perhaps shouldn't exist, creating so-called zombie companies. And it leaves corporations leveraged to old economies, paying back debt incurred in a past era when they perhaps would rather invest in new technologies amid a quickly changing world.

This debt buildup makes central bankers’ jobs both more difficult and easier in the years to come. It makes it harder because any withdrawal of stimulus, or raising of rates, would be exponentially more painful given the amount of corporate leverage. But it also makes it less likely that conditions will require Federal Reserve officials to raise rates all that much going forward. More debt will pressure longer-term growth and inflation. It reduces economic dynamism. 

All this isn’t to say that the lowest-rated bonds can’t lose value in the near term. They can, and according to some investors, are likely to do so. As Oleg Melentyev of Bank of America Global Research wrote in an April 16 note, investors may start to push back after buying a record amount of triple-C rated debt in February.

Funding for these companies “is still wide open, however we think more investors are now struggling at putting their dollars at risk into cap structures levered 14x on a go-forward basis while being paid 650bps to do so, an all-time low,” he wrote. “At some point the reach for yield reaches its limit, and we think it’s here.”

I decided to really buckle down and try to learn as much as I can about investing.  I have learned a lot, and I would like to know how I am doing in performing my own DD.  I might have gotten some things wrong but that's why I am posting this so I know if I'm doing it right or I need to fix how I'm doing things.

I've tried to use certain things that would catch my eye to give me a starting point when looking for companies to invest in..  While looking on Finviz, one of the things I learned about in my self education, is looking for companies with a low P/E ratio.  So I started there.  Looking for companies with a low P/E ratio,  I came across a company I am familiar with.  Growing up in a rather heavy agricultural area, a company many are probably familiar with as well, is Seneca Food Corporation.  

Seneca Foods Corporation provides packaged fruits and vegetables in the United States and internationally. The company offers canned, frozen, and bottled produce; and snack chips and other food products under the private label, as well as under various national and regional brands that the company owns or licenses, including Seneca, Libby's, Aunt Nellie's, READ, Green Valley, Paradise, Seneca Farms, and CherryMan. It also packs Green Giant, Le Sueur, and other brands of canned vegetables, as well as select Green Giant frozen vegetables for B&G Foods North America under a contract packing agreement. In addition, the company engages in the sale of cans and ends, as well as trucking and aircraft operations. It provides its products to grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores, and dollar stores; and food service distributors, industrial markets, other food packagers, and export customers in 90 countries, as well as federal, state, and local governments for school and other feeding programs. The company was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Marion, New York.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENEA. 

Going by a formula of anything with a P/E under 15 is good, SENEA has a P/E of 3.39.  The next thing I looked for is the Debt/Earnings and LTDebt/Earning ratio where anything under a .45 is good.  I found its D/E ratio is at a .25 and the LTD/E is at .23.  Next its the current assets to liability where anything over 1.5 is preferable.  It was at a 3.69.  Then it's to the PEG, 1-1.5 is good and SENEA is at 1.55.  P/S is next and it is good to have anything less than 1-2 and SENEA comes in at .30.  P/B needs to be anything less than 1.5 and it's coming in at .88.  Lastly is the P/FCF where under 15 is great over 20 is bad.  SENEA shows a 7.77.  

So far by these numbers that I am seeing, Seneca Food Corp is a pretty solid company to invest in.  Being one of the main food packaging companies in the US they will probably be around for a long time.

This is the kind of company I love right now.  Very, very safe investment that should generate reliable (albeit low) returns through all sorts of market conditions.  I wish I had picked up on this one myself.

I wouldn't expect crazy returns out of this one, but then again, that's not really the point.  Looks like a great, safe place to park some of your money.  I didn't thoroughly read your analysis or look at the company, so make sure you trust in your research, but at a glance, well done!",

mvh63m,gvbw7od,stocks,comment,1619017191,"They track the same index so should have all the same companies at the same weightings but they have different expense ratios so they will diverge over time as the expenses eat away slightly at the number of shares of the underlying company each share of the fund represents.

For example lets say I started a fund that tracked two stocks and on day one one of my shares was equal to one share of company A and one share of company B.  Assuming there were no stock splits or expenses after 10 years one share of my fund would still be worth 1 share of company A and one share of company B.  However I need to make money for my fund so I have an expense ratio.  I can't send you a bill for the expenses so instead I take it out of the value so now one share of my fund might be worth 0.99 shares of company A and 0.99 shares of company B where that 0.01 shares of each was sold and eaten as my expense ratio.

That is not to say the price of fund will tell you which one has lower expenses because they were started after different times and the newer fund will start out priced closer to the underlying average but if it had a higher expense ratio it would still diverge quicker.",

mvjuek,,stocks,post,1619023651,"Lumen Technologies: An Old School Value Investor's Favorite - Notes $LUMN*Note to reader: This is a copy from my* [*blog*](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/lumen-technologies-an-old-school-value-investors-favorite/) *that I wanted to share. The notes are from my* *Seeking Alpha* *article on Lumen Technologies. I can't link the original article because S*eeking Alpha articles are part of our blacklist. It's not hard to find.

It's been a few months since my last write up on Seeking Alpha. Since October 2020 I think. You can read the full thing on Seeking Alpha. They hold the rights. Below are just quick notes and I suggest to read the full thing to get the proper picture of the company and opportunity.

Disclosure: I'm long Lumen Technologies ($LUMN).

* I found out about Lumen Technologies through a Globe and Mail article discussing Francis Chou's Stonetrust investments. [Stonetrust Commercial](https://www.stonetrustinsurance.com/) is an insurance company in the U.S. and like most insurance companies they make money through disciplined underwriting and properly investing the float. It turned out that Lumen is a large holding. Who still has a landline? Why would Francis want to own a dying copper landline business? I had to look to deeper into this.
* It turns out that the stock is a favorite of some [other old school value investors](https://dataroma.com/m/stock.php?sym=LUMN) such as Dr. Michael Burry from Scion Asset Management, Prem Watsa from Fairfax Financials, and Mason Hawkins from Southeastern Asset Management. Something must attract them.
* Lumen Technologies has 1.1 billion shares that trades at $12.70 a share with a market cap of $13.9b. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield or $1 annually which indicates that the market is not too hot on the company. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield. It looks safe. It's covered by free cash flow of $2.8b-$3.0. That's enough to cover the $1.1b in annual dividend distribution. Management has reiterated their commitment. Of course that's never guarantee, but more a signal of confidence to the market.
* The market is currently valuing Lumen at 5x adjusted EV/EBITDA, 8.2x 2021E earnings, and 4.7x price to free cash flow per share of $2.74, my preferred metric. This implies a 21% FCF yield. When it comes to a company like Lumen, that has a lot of debt and D&A, measuring the right amount of cash left should take precedence over earnings.
* The depressed valuation, a market revaluation of their core assets, an improved profitability profile and balance sheet, and potential growth is what probably attracted these value investors.
* Lumen Technologies, formerly CenturyLink, provides communications and network services as well as security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. CenturyLink and Quantum Fiber for residential and small businesses. Lumen for enterprises.
* The firm owns 450,000 miles of fiber. It's one of the largest fiber optics network in the world. Most of it comes from their acquisition of Level 3 in 2017. It's a Tier-1 network. That's the network with the most connections. You need to pay for access. This is their competitive advantage. Lumen sells (wholesale) high bandwidth fiber optic long haul links to other carriers.
* Remember the old Internet as a “superhighway” analogy, well Lumen is one of the major highways. Lumen is among the largest network providers in the world. If their network fails, it takes jump a huge part of the Internet with them.
* Their massive fiber network and infrastructure acts as a moat. It’s too expensive to build and to develop it against the experts in the field. Fiber businesses are attractive because once it’s built, the “maintenance” or “sustaining” capex is relatively limited, and that drives FCF.
* The value of Lumen's fiber infrastructure network is not recognized by the market given the FCF yield of 21.5%. Lumen is looking to monetize their recently completed 3-year investment program and the 7.9% dividend yield looks safe. The downside is protected by the value of its fiber network (the cost to build a similar network is probably hundreds of billions) and recent large transactions for fiber peers were at double-digit EBITDA multiples.
* Lumen is the new name for CenturyLink since September 2020. The rebranding comes with a new business strategy that goes beyond just offering connection services. They recently launched the Lumen Platform to run cloud and edge computing applications. Lumen is betting that the platform will fuel growth.
* The Lumen Platform is a move beyond providing basic connectivity. It has the capabilities that go beyond providing just internet service. With the Lumen Platform, it will level its fiber infrastructure to provide software or other needs “as a service.” Practically, what we are seeing is the evolution from telecom company (CenturyLink) to tech company (Lumen).
* A lumen is a measure of the brightness of light and the name pays homage to their fast global fiber network foundation.
* It's a myth that 5G will not kill fiber. Instead it will enhance it's importance. 5G requires a lot more cell towers, a lot more bandwidth, and will need to be connected to a wired network. The explosion in data use, particularly mobile, could make fiber assets much more lucrative. 5G needs a fiber network that can power it through multiple contact points, and help it reconnect through physical barriers.
* Edge computing. Of all the new products Lumen is launching, the Lumen Edge Compute will be one of the main drivers of future growth. I think there’s a part of the cloud story that’s overlooked and that is edge computing. With the 5G rollout, edge computing is two words we will be hearing a lot more in the coming years. Edge computing places processing power closer to where data is being created in the physical world. Edge computing is a complement to the cloud by solving issues of latency, bandwidth, autonomy, or compliance.
* One great driver for edge computing is reduced latency (much faster computing speed means reduced waiting time). The more processing can do at the edge level, the less you have to rely on the cloud, and the faster the computing
* Lumen has a lot of debt and makes up most of the enterprise value of $45b. With debt there's what you owe and what you need to pay. They have been aggressive to pay down the debt over the years. Q4-2020 long-term debt stands at $31.8b. In 2020 alone Lumen managed to reduce net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and reduced leverage to 3.6x net-debt-to-adjusted.
* If I applied a price to sale multiple of 0.8x to 1x on depressed sales ($19b vs $20b actual), you are looking at a 9% to 36.4% gain. If Lumen manages to grow their sales, it will warrant a higher multiple.
* If we assume a 15% FCF yield (6.6x FCF), Lumen would return 34%. If Lumen manages to grow, it warrants a minimum multiple of 10x FCF, and this would imply a return of 115%.
* It won’t happen overnight. I don’t expect a significant short-term boom in revenues from their investments. This is a long term play. Instead I picture a slow rising trickle of revenue growth as the country upgrades the wireless network to support 5G standards.
* Three-pronged approach to higher stock price:

1. Market revaluation of fiber network and assets to more reasonable level. The cost and importance of building it should be the floor.
2. An improvement of the business. Growth + more profit + more FCF + less debt = higher stock price. Right now the market is not confident in Lumen. The mood is bad. Better results will change the mood.
3. Financial engineering. Selling off assets at higher than market prices to pay down the debt. Refinancing expensive debt at cheaper interest rate. Synergies from Level 3 acquisition. NOL that's in the bank etc...

* Ultimately, results will drive the stock price. Even with a conservative approach, I think there’s material upside if Lumen converts on the opportunities it sees and little downside if it misses. The negative is already priced in. Meanwhile you have an opportunity to buy a company with irreplaceable assets that's considered cheap on many different metrics.

A few weeks ago I was talking to my dad and he was saying how his portfolio has been killing it. Well, his portfolio has oil stocks, Industrials, and other ""boring"" stocks. Much more old school than my portfolio. He had shifted his portfolio to be more focused on the traditional  high performers during economic booms. I didn't have the foresight to do that. 

I looked at the YTD performance of all the S&P500 components and realized my portfolio has hardly any of the top performers. While my portfolio definitely has a higher weight in growth stocks, I still had a car manufacturer, a retail stock, an airline, some sector ETFs and some other reopening plays. I felt I was decently diversified. But the huge blind spot in my portfolio happened to be with the highest performers YTD.

Can't make myself buy oil stocks, but I ended up putting some money into an industrial ETF (I don't know enough about the industry to feel confident in any single stocks) and a Financials ETF. I also averaged down my cost basis in several of my tech stocks I'm confident will come back strong. This has all helped counterbalance my portfolio and the bleeding has been mitigated since shifting my portfolio.

Fact is this, not all these tech companies can survive. There isnt enough money for all of them. Half of the new companies will fold, a few will get bought if they have a unique tech (most do not), and only a few will be wildly successful. Thats just the truth of it.

And to be more specific. All these software companies coming out claiming to provide security tech for cloud and such wont survive. They are blowing smoke. Their tech is easy to duplicate. The only thing they offer is a temporary contract with someone which may or may not be renewed in the future. 

We also dont need 10 new eV makers, at least half will go under. We dont need more streaming services, the market is already saturated. We dont need more cloud services, that isnt even really a new tech, its a rebrand of the word ""internet"" service lol. We dont need more plant based meat, weve had that since the 90s and it hasnt changed. We dont new companies that claim they are innovative because they attached a screen to a fridge or bike... double lol. 

We are in a tech bubble. There is no doubt about it. Too much speculation and even ""old dogs"" are currently pretty pricey but at least those guys will likely survive.

Definitely diversify and dont under estimate the value of dividends and dividend growth. Stocking up cash makes you a king when markets crash. The dividends add up. Do NOT auto-reinvest divs! Save them and buy dips and crashes.",

""Time in the market"" > ""Timing the market"" - This is another one that seems to stand the test of time.  Constantly seeing advice on liquidating so they have ""cash on the side to buy the dip.""  Is that not just timing the market?  Why sell unless to spend or spend during retirement?

My question is why are subs like [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and such so popular, constantly everyday people posting about their super niche tailored portfolios with DD on random companies. And it seems there is a herd like mentality in these subs as well.

Tech stocks go up - all the DD and posts are about tech stocks - everyone is bullish in tech....until its not

Tech stocks go down - tons of QQ and posts about ""how is the market going up and I'm down 15%?"" - with comments talking about OP lacking diversification.

**Again if 95% of traders don't beat the market, why are so many people trying?**

Some things that I may not fully grasp:

* Are regular people building their custom portfolios, picking individual stocks not considered traders?
* The market has inefficiencies - does this invalidate the ""95% stat?""
* Does the ""95% stat"" only apply to professionals? And by some weird way allow retail average Joes better opportunity?
* Why does the consensus on all the finance subs seem to be centered around building your own portfolio?
* Are 19/20 people in these subs really failing to beat the market?
* Why not just VTSAX and chill?",
muwhxe,gv8c6e6,stocks,comment,1618943073,"1. Hubris - We can know that 95% of traders don’t beat the market, but we believe ourselves to be the exception. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Hubris is just a more negative word for confidence. 

2. Trying to beat the market and failing is how we learn. We may never in our lifetimes learn how to beat the market but learning anything over the course of your life is a good thing.

3. This one is counterintuitive, but as with everything else in life, making the most amount of money possible isn’t always the goal. If it were, we’d all be trying to become doctors, lawyers, or investment bankers. Yet we choose to go into careers that interest us. Investing is much the same, there are a lot of factors that impact how we invest that have less to do with returns and more to do with emotion, and that’s fine. Some people invest ethically, some invest in companies that they already support.

Which states that 95% of **finance professionals** can't do it, nothing said about average retail trader what so ever. It measured fund performance.

Why does that matter ? Well for one fund managers are bound by rules, companies interests and possibly wants to attract a lot of investors paying the fees for them to manage it all. For one thing you will never see a fund yolo his entire life savings into GME stock. You will never see a fund believing in Tesla from start to finish with their entire life savings etc. there are also going to be stock picks based on common sense, math, fundimentals more than someone just reading and liking a reddit post, retail traders/investors and finance professionals are living in 2 different worlds.

Second statistics that goes around endlessly - [80% of day traders lose money](https://www.curiousgnu.com/day-trading)

Especially on reddit this gets spinned to as ''80% of traders lose money'', but honestly there was nothing said about an average trader/investor. So if someone says that 80% of investors lose money, it is **false**

'' Day trading is a form of speculation in securities in which a trader buys and sells a financial instrument within the same trading day, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. Traders who trade in this capacity are generally classified as speculators. Day trading contrasts with the long-term trades underlying buy and hold and value investing strategies. Day trading can be considered a form of gambling.\[1\]\[2\] It is made easier using day trading software.\[3\] ''

Here is the definition from wiki. So unless you constantly decide to buy and sell the stocks in the same day, you are probably not a day trader.

Why do day traders lose money though ? You might want to take a look at day traders competition - high frequency trading - [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/high-frequency-trading.asp)

The third statistics i often see cited was made in 90s, sadly i can't find the source upon googling, but i wouldn't really rely on 90s studies to begin with, because at the time retail investors probably read about stocks on news papers and internet wasn't even a thing to begin with. Different times, different mindsets.

Am i saying that average retail investor beats the market ? **Absolutely not**

The general conscious is probably in the right ball park, but everyone loves to cite statistics that has nothing to do with retail investors which makes the saying that this many % of investors can't beat the market fundimentally **false**.

Edit: 


[Heres another interesting one. ](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf)

But we all play in the same huge sandbox. You list some very hindsight-focused (survivorship bias) examples to make it seem as if retail investors have a huge leg up because they’re willing to risk everything. What about the times they did it and lost everything? Even on GME some people got burned badly depending on when they bought in. 

Also, retail investors are still susceptible to biases and psychological quirks just like anyone else. You will always find a subset of funds or retail investors who can beat the market. It’s irrelevant to use them as examples because we should only care about the average cases. It is not reasonable for people to read your post and assume they will be one of the very few to beat the market over decades. 

All you need to do is read the research conducted into total market returns to completely remove the retail vs professional element from the debate: a paper found that a large majority of stocks end up underperforming treasury bills over their lifetimes. Roughly 4% of all stocks explained the market’s return from early 1920’s until now.

This week has been my first time trading options and so far I have made $1000 on premiums. I set the strike price at a point where I’ve decided I would be comfortable selling anyway (mostly around 40%+ gains) and the date several months out and then just collect the premiums. 

My plan is to now buy 100 shares of something new and continue selling covered calls. I don’t want to sell too many of my shares in my highest confidence stocks so ideally I would like a fresh set of holdings dedicated to options trading.

And I won't be needing the money for at least a year (then I may want to buy a new apartment).

A part of me is really tired of this randomness/craziness of the market this year and the bandwidth of my time it is taking. Even though I am down like 60K of unrealized gains since mid February, I feel like just liquidating everything (or keep only some solid names like MSFT, APPLE, GOOGL) and come back in a couple of months or after the summer and start putting things in indexes/ETFs only. 

However, looking at how much oversold some stocks seem to be I want to unleash some of this cash (say 50K) and DCA to a good level. For example some of my top holdings are IQQH, TDOC, BAIDU and BABA, and currently I am at these levels:

IQQH (-12%) (about 7k down)

TDOC (-7%) (about 3K)

BAIDU (-9%) (about 3K)

BABA (-2%) (about 1K)

I also have some stocks where I didn't invest as much but seem to have entered at almost their ATHs out of FOMO and been bleeding a lot, like EXPI, where I am like -44% down (-3.5K down),  butterfly (-42%, 2K down), OPENDOOR (-33%, 1.8K down). Though it will be easy to DCA these down considering the amount of money I have invested, I have no idea if they will recover soon (or ever at all). So I would rather take my bet on the likes of tdoc, baba and baidu rather than on these ones.

Goes down slowly over whatever your DCA period is? Otherwise, it is just a 25%+ loss with no real way for DCA to make up for it.

 - Do nothing.    
 - Set limits or alerts to auto-exit these positions at **break-even**, since you clearly have no DD/story/plan for the positions (likely months from now).

Start researching and buying individual stocks. Avoid funds. You will learn nothing if you invest in funds. Learn to buy individual stocks. Research their financials and sectors. Thats how you learn.

Books are nice, so feel free to read, but how do you know which book is good without frame of reference? You cant. Most business people are dolts and guess who writes books about investing? That would be people who arent particularly good at it. Thats why they write books... so they make money selling books instead. Someone really good at investing, is too busy making money doing it.

Invest in your own education. Learn it yourself. Once you understand the basics, the books become more valuable because you can at least gauge who is blowing smoke up your rear.

Recommended Order of Learning:

1. Simple stocks  
\- Businesses that are very easy to understand like food, retail, or basic manufacturing. Anyone can understand these without much education. This will teach you micro economics.
2. Financial Sector  
\- Slight more complex but instrumental to understand macro economics. You need to know this to get really good. Mainly know how banks work, both savings and investment banks and how they interact with government. This wont be easy but its very important.
3. Complex Stocks  
\- I highly recommend you go into sciences in college... because that is your intro to tech and biotech, both of which are highly profitable  IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING . I highly recommend you major in CS if you can for that reason, even if you dont intend to work in CS. You can do almost any business job with that major anyway.  
\- Learn about REITs. They are not hard, per se, but the way they make money is really weird due to depreciation. Their financial reports look wacky for that reason but this will teach you about real estate. This is an important sector.
4. Options  
\- This will teach you how to hedge. This is extremely important and what separates average from great. Buy some cheap calls/puts just to get some experience with them. Its ok if you lose... just dont sell calls/puts initially because that is risky.
5. Fixed Income  
\- you already got exposed them in the financial sector above. Just solidify it. Not so important these days due to stupid low interest rates but still important to the economy as a whole and you never know when they become profitable again.

Also, AMD has tons of price targets in the $100+ range, and all the rumors and news points to a gangbusters Q1 earnings ($WDC, $MU, $IBM, and $TSM, all major players in the PC and data center space has had huge revenue beats), it's crazy that the stock is still under $80 just a week before earnings!

Personally, from my own attempts at TA \[[https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png](https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png)\], I believe $AMD is at the bottom of it's current price channel, and the stock is going to start recovering towards Q1 earnings; my hope is that AMD will experience a Parabolic jump like it did on July of last year, the situations are similar, where it spent long periods of trading sideways, while the rest of the tech sector was booming, AMD being flat then didn't make any sense, nor does it now.  Full disclosure, I have a ton of 5/7 Call options riding on a Monster Q1 earnings beat and guidance.","['AMD', 'WDC', 'IBM', 'MU']"

mv79ir,,stocks,post,1618975557,"Whats the difference between Limit Price, Stop-Limit Price,Stop-Loss Price?Are all able to be used for both buying and selling?

From what I know, limit pricing for buying means you set a price and if the market price falls to ur limit price or below, it will help you to buy the stock. As for selling, if the market price rises to ur limit price or above, it will help you to sell the stock? Assuming there is enough liquidity in the market.

Stop-Loss Price is to set a price whereby if the market price drops to that level, you will want to sell the stock no matter what. So let say I set it at $90, and the market price plummeted to $85, and there is only liquidity at $85 but no one wants to buy at $90, it will help me to sell at $85? Does this mean no matter how much the market plummet to, as long as the market price drops below $90, at a price with enough liquidity, it will help me sell? How does Stop-Loss Price apply when buying?

Stop-Limit Price is just Stop-Loss Price with a limit pricing? So if I set my Stop-Loss Price at $90, at any price below or at $90, it will trigger the Stop-Loss Price? But can I put my Limit Price both higher or lower than my Stop-Loss Price? So if I put my Limit Price at $92, once the market rises back to $92 or above from $90 and below when the Stop-Loss Price was triggered, it will help me sell my shares? What if the price never goes back up to $90 and above? Does my stock never get sold? So shouldnt I set my Limit Price at $88, whereby once the Stop-Loss Price is triggered at $90, it will help me sell my shares at $88 and above? Also, how does this apply to the context of buying?

Thank you!",
mv79ir,gvaet4t,stocks,comment,1618978809,"Stop loss orders when selling are a way to prevent loss. The addition of limit just prevents you from selling a very low price in case the stock gaps down on open. So in your example if the stock opened at $50, and you just had a stop loss to sell at or below $90 the stock will sell at $50. This is where a limit will help, you can say sell below $90 but limit at $70. In this case the stock won't sell.

In case of buying, it's the same concept. Let's say you want to buy a stock when breaks out of a trading range, you can set a stop loss to buy a stock once the stock moves out of that range. So for example, a stock XYZ is trading in $90-$95 range but you want to buy if it breaks $100 resistance. You set a stop loss order to execute if the stock trades above 100. If the stock trades above $100, your order becomes a market order. A stop limit will protect you in case the stock gaps up and opens at $150 but you wanted to buy above $100 but max at $120.

In case of buying stop price can only be higher than current market price and limit needs to higher than stop price.

In case of selling, stop price has to be lower than current market price and limit needs to be lower than stop price.",
mv79ir,gval4w4,stocks,comment,1618983397,"A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock when it reaches a certain price (the limit).

If the current price is $50, I can place a buy limit at $49 (bid), and my broker will complete the trade when the ask goes to $49.

If the current price is $50, I can place a sell Kim at $51 (ask), and my broker will complete the sale when the bid goes to $51.

These bids and asks are what constitute the market.

A stop limit is an order to create a limit buy or sell when the price passes a certain mark. This mark is called the stop. A stop loss is a type of stop limit where you create a limit sell order when the stock falls below a certain mark. The purpose of a stop loss is to set the mark below which you take your money and run.

While stop losses are a good way to limit your losses, they are also a way to solidify your gains. You can place what’s known as a “trailing stop loss,” where your stop price will rise as the stock price rises, lagging a specified percentage behind, but the stop price does not fall as the stock price falls. This way, you are increasing your exit price as the stock price rises, but you will never miss your chance to sell high if the bottom drops out.",['KIM']

Robinhood claims to have almost no commission fees but I know they do charge some but it’s so minimal it feels like nothing. I have also traded with ETFs on Robinhood and have had enough information to tell that any management fees are taken from the stock’s daily return. So my question is that I have heard from professors that triple leverage ETFs are not good long term investments because the management fees are higher than normal and that it causes time decay. Well how are they not good long term investments when QQQ (the unleveraged version of the ETF) is up 203.7% for the past 5 years while TQQQ (the triple leveraged Version) is up 1097.04% in the past 5 years?

mv8qov,gvakxls,stocks,comment,1618983244,"Decay has nothing to do with management fees and everything to do with the nature of leverage.

With TQQQ, you’d end up with $97.75 and be down not 0.75% but actually 2.25%. So when markets are very volatile, leveraged ETFs experience this decay and that’s why they’re not recommended as a long term investment.",
mv8qov,gvakmii,stocks,comment,1618983001,"I don’t think most people have a clue what they’re talking about.

They will say it’s meant to be held short term, that it’s meant as a backup plan for other failings, that it’s increased risk due to magnifying volatility.

Here’s the reality - if you’re comfortable going from $58 to $20 in like 12 days and then being up to $83 4 months later, it’s not a bad idea.

The problem is that when you buy and hold it your whole portfolio will jump up and down like an acrobat on a trampoline.

If you don’t need to take the money out and you can keep holding through the down periods you’d be fine with it.

If you’re fine having to always buy and cash out using limit orders because it’s too volatile to do a market order you’re fine.

I’ve thought of doing it. I still might do it. The only problem is that if there’s any sort of a correction you can be down 90% in a matter of days and have to wait years to get back to normal. But that’s the same problem with any index fund.

However I’d also want to caution that a ton of people recently had the same idea you did and hopped into those funds because they aren’t sure what the **** else to do with the crazy market right now.

And when things go back to normal they will cash out and it will cause a massive dip.

mv0b3x,,stocks,post,1618952485,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 20, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 20, 2021**

Stocks fell Tuesday, with all three major indexes dipping for the second straight session. Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  

Despite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it’s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, ""Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.""

In recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it’s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. 

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.
* Senior executives with Alphabet's Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel said on Monday.
* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

mv0b3x,gvaajda,stocks,comment,1618976132,"Don't kid yourselves,  I work at a restaurant and the supply chain is all fucked. 

Not only do people not want to work, people are not coming out. That means reopening people are still holding onto their money and the businesses are unable to hire enough people.

Also, people who are working and have jobs are paying more for food, and shelter and of course, getting stimulus checks will help, but everybody needs them. Good for LA for doing the UBI.",
mv30g4,,stocks,post,1618960357,"How ICLN Holdings have changed (As of April 19)ICLN holdings have changed quite a bit, with quite a lot of stocks being added to the mix. The table below is quite large, so here's a link for anyone that would like to download and view the table from their own desktop:
https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvenkqTxBF38hHgxU34JaWNAK1kw?e=0UgB0y

I'll list some of what I believe to be the big changes for those who don't want to spend time looking through the chart:
- NZD Cash accounts for 7.7% of the weight, which may imply holdings will be increased, or more stocks are yet to be bought.
- New holdings ENEL, NEE and XCEL now account for about 13.4% of ICLN.
- Verbund AG, closely followed by Meridian Energy took the biggest hits, having 3,000,000 ($222,767,000) and 50,100,000($195,255,000) sold
- PLUG had it's holding decreased by 4,000,000 shares, reducing the total weighting to 3.55%
- Notable additions, in my opinion are BLDP and FCEL (I have a bias for hydrogen fuel cells/hydrogen in general)

I fucking doubt that.  More likely semi's supply issue will resolve more quickly than feared.

I just started investing this year, and so I’ve been trying to better my knowledge of trading, and I’m looking to build my portfolio for longevity. A little about me: I’m 22, work full time at a decent paying job, After my monthly expenses I have about $100 for saving, $100 for stocks, and some play money left over but I get paid every two weeks.

  So far my portfolio is about 80% crypto diversified amongst BTC, DOGE, LTC, ETH, and ETC. I’m only in about $1,050 before everything I’ve made from them. And trust me I have a good idea of this subs position on crypto, and more specifically Doge lol, but it’s been a fun ride, and I’ve enjoyed it.
  The rest of my portfolio is sunk between Tesla, and a energy company - SWN which is about $300. Also 2 shares of a $8 stock I bought back in 2016 I never sold and the company went under.

  Now I plan on starting to go more into blue chip stocks for longevity, so I’ve been watching AAPL, WMT, and HD for a good time to buy in (Roku has kinda peaked my interest too).
  This sub has convinced me that EFTs are something I should been looking more into though, but after doing some of my own research I still don’t understand them. Like I don’t exactly understand what they really are, or what makes an EFT work putting money into? Why are there 15 EFTs that all start with the same company name, and because of that how do I know which one I should be buying?

  Are reoccurring payments a smart decision when it comes to longevity, if so say $10 a month for a example stock (let’s say Amazon) on top of the money I already invest?","['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'TSLA', 'HD']"
mvgfy3,gvbr4fb,stocks,comment,1619014903,"ETF is just an investment fund, you can read up on those. ETF in particular can be bought and sold like a stock, which is very convenient. A fund is any collection of peoples money that tries to make profit by following a strategy.

Many companies offer similar funds. If you don't know where to start (and maybe even more so if you do), you could start with very broad market funds. More diversity is more stability. A total market fund, or one that tries to replicate a very broad index, such as S&P500 or a world index. Look for funds that have relatively low fees (well below 1%), as those add up over time.

Reoccuring investment is a great strategy to invest, and probably what most people here do. But because shares have to usually be bought one at a time, it's hard to invest in a chunk of 10 dollars. Some non-ETF-funds allow that. Or you could save up until you can buy a whole share. Choose a fund that has been split into cheap shares to make that easier. (Some cost 40 per share, others 700. There is no fundamental difference.)",['SPGI']

mvcy0l,gvbw4ut,stocks,comment,1619017157,"Sounds like a tomato, tomatoe problem, right?

You start with the ""Revenue"" part. That's your gross ""income"" level and you go down the books, accounting in your ""Costs of Revenue"", ie. what you need to spend, operating expenses which include payroll, marketing, costs of production, etc. and factor some other things like pesky taxes, depreciations and the like.

The *Revenue itself* usually is purely derived from *sales of products or services to whoever your business partners are (ie. B2B or B2C).* 

There are other kinds of income, like long term interest, leases billed etc. - *unless* leasing or renting out space is your main model of revenue. Think REITs. They only have Revenues derived from letting living/office space.

It's complicated until you arrive at the EBITDA line.

Once you have EBITDA, you factor in any write-offs (""Depreciatons"") and taxes (credits) etc. 

And then you're a certified accountant if you carried all the Zeroes properly and can show your Big Head Honcho (CEO) who usually is very interested in the ""net income"" part, ie. the margin.

Look at the NFLX finance sheet to see how it's accounted, from top (Revenue) to bottom (EBITDA and further down):

Nobody talking seems to be talking the implications for *every single individual investor*

In the days prior to the covid investment cycle, competitors shorted the heck out of disruptive stocks like Tesla. They took on real risk to hold down their competition. 

After GME scared the heck out of these firms being an uncontrollabke wild card, ""share borrowing"" was invented.

Essentially companies can short their competitors without risk of being locked into the short & becoming illiquid. All they do is call one of the offering brokerage firms and pay to borrow the shares. They can then buy out their position with these and fidelity returns the shares to the owner whenever at their leisure. Their goals accomplished both matter if they earn physical dollar count or not. In the end:

1. Broker makes money

2. Shorter makes money (maybe)

3. Technical structure and value of disruptive stock gets destroyed

4. Loaner makes a few dollars cash,

5. Everyone is happy right? Except loaner loses future value of their shares but isnt the wiser.

This is not just just slowing societal progress, its potentially murdering it.

For a roadmap into the who's who of disruption all need to do is look at the lists of companies brokers are asking to borrow shares for. Industries/commodities like vertical farming and graphene. In the last few months a few of these companies recieved spikes of higher short interest than GME at peak.

Borrowing the share does not reduce the risk of the short at all.  The risk of the short is that the stock goes up and if it goes up too much they can be margin called because the cost to maintain the proper margin balance also goes up with the price of the shorted shares.

Shorting is not slowing societal progress or murdering it.  It is people betting that a bunch of stocks are going to go down and possibly to zero but it doesn't actually cause the company itself to fail.

1. $NDRA- They have created a machine by the name of TAEUS which really changes the Diagnosis industry. TAEUS would be 50 times cheaper than MRI and nearly as agreed. They are awaiting FDA approval and the price target after the approval is $6. As of writing, the stock is at $2.2.
2. $ATOM- This company has extended Moore's law. They have quantum engineered a material which is like silicon. This material would be used to make microchips which increase transmission of data by 33%. They have already struck a deal with Qualcomm. They have a price target of $56 and the stock is currently at $20 (as of writing).
3. $CIDM- This company is basically targeting the small portions of industry of streaming left behind by the giants such as Netflix. They have had a lot of acquisitions last year. Currently, the stock is valued at $1.15. I believe it can go to $3.5.
4. $OEG- This is a solar energy company. They have a market cap of 200 million. However, they have struck a deal for 725 million dollars. They are also partnering up with Akon (rapper) for his solar city project in Africa. The stock is currently at $4.14 and has a target of around $15.
5. $PCSA- They have several drugs for cancer in the making and each can rake in $1 billion for the company. The company has a Market cap of just $51 million. The stock is currently at $8.56 and has a forecast of $17
6. $EDSA- This company focuses on developing and commercialising clinical stage drugs. The stock is currently at $5.06 and has a market cap of $61 million. The forecast for this is $18. However, I feel that it could reach around $25.

mv6eax,,stocks,post,1618972223,"Thoughts on $BA near term and long termI’m long on BA with 400 shares. I unfortunately bought at a peak around $273 and averaged down to $270. I’ve sold some CC along the way to help, but I stopped this week since the price movement has been quite volatile. 

Bullish sentiments:
Thinking about financials 62b in debt, but continue to have orders come in. Deferred orders from southwest to 2022 and 2023 was also announced today. 

New chinook orders for Britain, and 100 new planes ordered by SW airlines. Iran looking to revive orders though not sure if the geopolitical issues. 

Stock plummeted at the announcement of the CFO retiring at 54 years old and some FUD about it being a precursor to earnings since he did it just before earnings. I’m not familiar with the intricacies of management changes and how they affect stocks so maybe someone with more trading experience and fill me in? My theory is he intended to step in as CEO, but given his age and Calhoun getting an extension on CEO time frame he won’t really have a timeline to act as CEO, or he simply wanted to retire. Boeing isn’t in the verge of bankruptcy. 

Stock has been bludgeoned since owning it, but I’ve not let my emotions get the best of me as I feel conviction that it can hit $300 in a year or two just sucks to have to wait. 

Balance sheet wise they also have another loan they haven’t drawn down on and may not need to tap into. Likely negative cash flow this quarter, but near term CEO Calhoun expects a return to positive cash flow. A large back order of planes at around 4,300 and military side of the business.  After hours news today that the transportation committee is doing a third audit into the approval of the max return (yeesh seems a bit like overkill, but ok)

Boeing has ramped up hiring according to a few sources I know. They’ve also liquidated unnecessary real estate holdings to save cash, pushed voluntary retirements to bring in fresh cheaper labor, and have maintained their dividend halt to help with cash flow. 

Boeing has had so much heat I think it’s leadership understands the gravity of the QA problems that need to be addressed. I actually like that they’ve stayed pretty quiet and mostly focused on working through the problems. Sometimes silence is better than opening ones mouth especially with the sentiment and brand damage they’ve been dealing with. As they say actions speak louder than words. 

Bearish sentiments:
Vaccinations nationwide around 20% fully vaccinated and 40% on their first shot. Europe, Middle East and Asian markets are dealing with their own issues of vaccine distribution. 

There’s some talk about another financial crash happening this year due to defaults from zombie companies raising on debt and historically large margin borrowing. 

Interest rates rising could affect profits.  

SpaceX and LMT are competitors and who knows what other market spacex could try to tap (ahem consumer aviation?)

Is it possible they could do a share offering to pay down debts further diluting the stock? No one knows, but could happen. Seems ramping production and deliveries could help avoid this. 

Boeing definitely has a culture issue, but it could be foolish to think management doesn’t recognize some of these issues as they’ve had their feet held closest to the fire, still the issue remains. 

Don’t overlook the political issues with China. Lots of materials sourced from the region to manage costs. Really gotta bank on relationships improving over the next few years. 

What are your thoughts? For the record I’m down about $15000 unrealized YTD. Talk about “diamond hands” as they say.  I owned Boeing for 12 years prior before selling earlier in the year. Rebought at a bad timing.

Update: things evolve fast. Sounds like JJ vaccine approved again in Europe. 

My price target is $285 end of year. I think that’s realistic in a forward thinking market and assuming no more plane crashes or catastrophic events that hamper Boeing’s ability to profit.","['BA', 'LMT']"

This will create much more stability.  What you want a Vanguard Fund, who is price-insensitive,  buying up stock XYZ to always keep a floor under it.  You always want to have a buyer of last resort.  Let's use Gamestop as an example.  Not only do they have ETFs from Invesco, Wedbush, SPDR buying up their shares in the event of new share creations but they have HUGE  Target Date funds (like Vanguard) continuing to buy it at 165 (or whatever the price is now) because they are price-insensitive.  They do not have any discretion to look at price before buying.  So your dad or aunt or even grandpa who is still working contributing to their 401k which is 100% allocated to a target date fund of XXXX year, a small portion of that will go to buy GME at whatever price it is at.

DKNG (Draftkings) - adding more as often as possible, lots of growth potential here, been adding and holding since under 40

TSLA (Tesla) - was in at 420 and out around 620 then got back in at 699 just recently and plan to hold for the long haul 

RKT (Rocket Companies) - love being able to own stock in this company, adding and holding edit; had to sell some on the big squeeze but got right back in, was truly a blessing 🙌 

CHWY (Chewy) - great company taking over the pet product game, great buy/add zone rn in my humble opinion, been buying shares since 55 and sold some around 90-100...added some back last week and won't be selling anymore for awhile

SPOT (Spotify) - love this app for music and podcasts, pretty much the only thing I use for music anymore (and this goes for all of my friends and family members), probably not a bad spot to buy or add some 

PYPL (Paypal) - was going to add some SQ awhile back (still want to and probably will), but wanted to add this one first, not going to give a big spiel on this but I like them a lot in the crypto/fintech space obviously and believe they actually have a leg up on SQ 

AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) - honestly I like NVDA better than AMD but I love the way AMD is lagging NVDA right now - added this one for a longer term swing as I'm expecting a nice push back to highs before long (might keep some long term as well after trimming profits), highly technical play but this company is obviously a good company with a lot of good stuff in the works

DOCU (Docusign) - I just can't not have some of this in my portfolio, they were a big player during the covid shutdown, largely due to the fact that they have an excellent service that was well positioned to capitalize on the situation, and they have a service i believe will remain relavent and a company that will continue to grow so I bought some (not a bad spot to add or get in, just look at the weekly!)

LOW (Lowes) - material prices rising as well as home improvements in general (I own a small remodeling business and I can tell you first hand we are busier than ever), I got some around 160 and wish I had bought more but probably will keep what I do have for awhile 

DIS (Disney) - liking the company for reopening plus they made bank during the shutdown via a number of different new revenue streams, solid long-term play here imo

ABNB (Airbnb) - let's see where this one goes, im certainly not one to buy every IPO to hit the market but this was one I had a feeling about, seems worth owning some and having some exposure to this business 

SPLK (Splunk) - holding a small long-term position here, they deal in machine data/automation

NVTA (Invitae) - like this company for the long-term, they are in the genomics/gene therapy space 

And im holding crypto (BTC/LTC/ETH)

munvr5,,stocks,post,1618916639,"Stem Inc ($STPK) DD**Stem Inc - Due Diligence**

Stem Inc (ticker STPK) was established in 2009 and is a provider of battery storage and AI optimisation software to Utilities and Large Corporates (including Amazon, Facebook and UPS) in the US, Canada and Japan.

**Total Addressable Market and Market Position**

Stem is the market leader in the fast-growing energy storage market. Wood Mackenzie forecast a Total Addressable Market for energy storage of $1.2 trillion by 2050, and for the battery storage market to increase by 25x by 2030. The size of Stem’s market is rapidly expanding due to:

1. The declining cost of batteries, driving increased adoption. This is already happening with Electric Vehicle batteries, and the same economies of scale are benefiting Stem. Batteries are now increasingly being installed with solar and wind to reduce their intermittency
2. Stem is expecting to see the introduction of a standalone investment tax credit in the US for clean energy storage, allowing storage to be eligible for tax concessions (matching the concessions available to solar & wind). This is expected to open up a variety of new markets in the US.
3. The Biden administration has proposed a $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid, putting the US on a path to achieving 100% carbon free electricity. Batteries and smart software are required to manage renewable’s intermittency.
4. Broader Clean Energy / ESG mandate from large corporates and governments worldwide. There will be plenty of macro catalysts for Stem in the coming years

Stem is the market leader with 75% market share in the Californian battery storage market (larger than their next 4 competitors combined), with California being the largest market in the US. Stem has a first mover advantage, as they’re already operating with over 40 utilities, 5 grid operators, for a cumulative total of more than 20 million run-time hours. This is the equivalent to Stem already operating 12 gas peaker plants (1 GWH).

Stem sources batteries from Tier 1 manufacturers, including LG, Tesla and Samsung. They are one of the largest purchasers of utility grade batteries in the US, and are agnostic on who’s batteries they install – their software can attach to nearly any battery. In terms of their supplier’s bargaining power, they see Tesla as operating in a different market to them. Tesla is seen as doing much larger projects, such as the Australian ‘Big Battery’. They also see Tesla as primarily a manufacturer, who’s trying to scale their output (similar to how Foxconn is a manufacturer to Apple). They’re also not dependent upon Tesla batteries, as they can switch to other suppliers. Interestingly, they believe they introduced Tesla to the Japanese market!

**Stem’s Competitive Advantage – Athena AI**

Essentially Stem’s business model is supplying and installing a Battery and AI Software bundle. Stem’s AI software, called Athena, is their competitive advantage over other battery providers.

Athena is a propriety, patented, AI optimisation software which Stem bundle with battery installation. Athena analyses large data sets (over 700,000 data points per second) in real time to optimise electricity flows. It takes into account energy prices, grid dynamics, weather, and customer usage patterns to lower their electricity costs by up to 30%.

It does this, by example, by taking advantage of electricity price fluctuations. Very simply, Athena will instruct batteries to charge when prices are low (say during the day when solar panels are generating lots of surplus power) and discharge into the grid when prices are high (say during the evening when solar is off). This electricity market participation creates value for their customers and for Stem. There are 13 ways in which Athena creates value for customers, with this just being a simple example of a price arbitrage scenario.

I believe Athena has a strong competitive ‘moat’ due to:

1. Athena is attached to 100% of Stem’s battery sales, and at no point has a customer ever asked for the software to be removed. Stem has 75% market share of the Californian battery storage market, illustrating the strong demand for Athena
2. Athena generates 80% Gross Margins, which demonstrates both the lack of substitute software solutions and the value that customers place on Athena
3. Athena gets better with more use. There are more than 950 systems operating or contracted with Athena, which have collectively generated more than 20 million runtime hours of data, generating a wealth of data to train and improve Athena. This data itself is a source of competitive advantage, with battery suppliers reportedly seeking to purchase this data from Stem. Competitors simply don’t have this data, don’t have a market leading position to generate this data, and don’t have the luxury of time to make up the shortfall.

**Strengthened Balance sheet**

The main tangible benefit of the merger with Star Peak Energy Transition Corp (ticker STPK) is the cash – Stem has a war chest of $525m to pursue growth. Stem is going to use these funds to grow in 4 tangible ways

1. Reduction in Working Capital. Prior to its strengthened balance sheet, Stem had to pay 100% for batteries up-front, and wouldn’t get paid by the customer until the project was complete. This meant Stem had to fund the holding cost of the battery purchase for several months, which curtailed their growth. With its stronger balance sheet, Stem expects to negotiate better deals with its supplier’s, driving a $100m improvement in working capital over the next 24 months
2. Bid on larger projects. Multiple times in the past, large utility owners have curtailed Stem’s level of participation on projects due to a lack of balance sheet strength. This cut Stem’s project participation to just 30%, 40% or 50%. However, going forward with the stronger balance sheet, they expect to land larger opportunities
3. Further investment in Athena, to extend its market leading position
4. International expansion

**Valuation**

Stem has provided guidance to 2026, with a Revenue CAGR of 80% from 2020 to 2026. 2021 revenue is expected to be 4.5x 2020 revenue. 2021’s revenue is already secured by signed customer contracts – Stem is actively is executing on these. Further confidence in revenue forecasts comes from a contracted backlog of $200m (as of 17 January 2021).

Revenue quality is underpinned by Stem’s contracting model - Athena is provided on a 10 to 20 year subscription term in conjunction with the battery sale. This provides significant and predictable long term cash flows beyond just an upfront battery sale.

A Discount Cash Flow analysis of their Free Cash Flow forecast, plus their $525m cash, equates to **$47.80/share** (8% discount rate, 2.5% perpetual growth rate), representing substantial upside from the current stock price. Upside to this target is possible from market expansion and government policy changes, including:

1. Movement into residential properties. This is an untapped market, with Stem actively considering how best to enter this market. Entry into the residential market is not included in their FCF
2. Upside from the proposed energy storage investment tax credit. Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office
3. Upside from Biden’s proposed $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid. Similarly, Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office

Stock futures are down a bit as of 0630. The Russell 2000 is off about 0.3%, Nasdaq and Dow by about 0.1%. S&P 500 roughly flat. This follows a day of major gains across risk assets. Russell 2000 added 2.3% yesterday, with the Nasdaq clocking gains of 1.2%.

If only somebody had told you yesterday might be a buying opportunity? Oh wait, somebody did and that somebody was me.

In fairness it isn’t hard to predict these things when you just have the same patterns repeating themselves. When stocks sell off due to anything related to COVID, it’s been a safe bet that the situation will reverse itself after a couple of days. 

Not ready to make any major predictions about today though. It’s another busy day of earnings: AT&T and Biogen among those reporting before the bell. Dow Inc. just came in ahead of estimates. Later we have reopening stocks American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Airlines have been one of the few disappointments during earnings season so far.

We also have initial jobless claims at 0830 and existing home sales at 1000.

> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


>He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said.","['FB', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'TWTR']"

mvwh0z,,investing,post,1619062572,"Reconciling the Intelligent Investor with Current Bond yields.Ok, I’ve just finished The Intelligent Investor for the first time. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with investing as Graham defines it (as opposed to speculating) and the current situation with bond yields with his advice that you should keep at least 25% allocated because of the potential for things to change in the future. 

I’ve also been a fan of Ray Dalio’s advice, and recently read his post on avoiding bonds altogether.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio)

These two thought streams are seemingly at odds, and the best I can come up with is that Graham’s advice didn’t take into account such low bond yields ever existing, and I’m probably better off following Dalio’s advice:

“ I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.”

I’ve gotten rid of bond ETFs completely from my portfolio, and now have some gold, emerging Asia markets, commodities, foreign value ETFs to replace them.

I’d love to hear all of your thoughts on both reconciling Graham’s investment approach with current bond yields and on Dalio’s thoughts. What do you think?",

mve8vh,,investing,post,1619006842,"Netflix Misses Q1 Subscriber Targets, Blaming Covid-19 Issues, But Beats Financial ForecastsNetflix reported 208 million global subscribers as of the end of the first quarter, missing its own prediction for 210 million.


The streaming giant did beat financial targets, though with earnings per share of $3.75 coming in well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.


The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

After cursory research, I learned that they are advantageous to get in an IRA DUE TO COMPOUNDING TAX BENefits.
It seems that the average dividem pay out is about 4 %.  That doesn’t seem that great.  Even at my tax bracket that would translate to 6 percent which I guess is t bad.  What are other benefits of REITS besides diversity?

Jaguar Land Rover is to temporarily shut down production at two of its main UK factories because of a shortage of computer chips, in the latest sign of the difficulties facing the global car industry during the pandemic.

It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date.

The automotive industry is used to running lean “just-in-time” supply chains that minimise the amount of cash tied up in factory warehouses. However, the global nature of the chip shortage has strained carmakers as they compete directly with tech companies for supply.

Manufacturing will continue at JLR’s Solihull plant. JLR’s international factories in Slovakia, Brazil and China are as yet unaffected.",

mvoso0,,investing,post,1619037311,"$KARO - Comprehensive DD - Recent IPO - Exec Summary**Exec Summary for those that want a TL:DR**

Firstly - I am an existing shareholder, own around 900 shares with an average buy price of $34 (so I am down on this... but in the current market, who isn't). KARO are a leading global provider of vehicle telematics. The proprietary in-house technology provides the best intelligent, actionable data to fleet operators and security for all vehicle owners - across 23 countries over 5 continents. Most interesting areas of the business to me are their AI Video & Fleet Telematics, along with how they use their data to sell used cars and insurance in the future. I am impressed that they seem to keep developing the business, whilst maintaining a very healthy 15% margin.

* KARO is a holding company, the actual company is Cartrack
* 1.3m subscribers with 50 billion data points each month - data provides KARO with a huge opportunity for growth
* Business has continued strong growth through Covid (16% compared to 22% CAGR previously), expected rate is 26% for future years
* Free cash flow around 25%
* Prior to delisting from JSE, to list on NASDAQ and then do an inwards investment back onto the JSE - the stock price hit $629, with a share consolidation taking place at 10:1 - giving at all time high of $62.90 per share. Typically South African investment is more conservative that US/EU investors - who are more accepting of potential earnings forming part of the share price.
* Price to earnings is 28x - which is low in their industry, with the average being around 53x

**Products & Services**

What does KARO currently offer?

B2B - known as 'My Fleet' - Live Vision to make sure the driver is concentrating and not on their phone, insurance telematics, fleet management and optimisation, stolen vehicle recovery and fleet administration services. All services typically outsourced, not many companies I know of will invest in developing this tech themselves which is good for Karo.

B2C - known as 'My Car' - Vehicle protector, stolen vehicle recover (with promise to customer), crash alert to emergency services and insurance telematics.

**Customer Profile**

**South Africa -** De Beers, MAN, Avis, SA Taxi, Super Sport, Hino and many more - company originates from SA and very strong YOY performance here.

**Rest of Africa** \- Toyota, Cat, Moove and NCBA

**Europe** \- LaFarge, Telefurgo, Green Galaxy and Sonae MC

**Asia** \- Singapore Prison Service, ORIX, Grab Rentals & Asia Brewery

Lots more to list - company has accounts open in the UK and US - with very small amounts of trade at the moment, but they have a track record of aggressive expansion whilst maintaining margins.

**Financials (Converted from ZAR to USD... took a while, so apologies if you spot any errors)**

Without doubt my favourite part of this company, extremely strong performer and growth looks very positive, with sufficient results to back up projections.

Low Debt - $1.2m

Total Cash - $7m

Free Cash Flow Margin - 25%

Total Assets - $140m

Total Liabilities - $56m

Debt Coverage - Well covered by operating cash flow (2019%)

Gross Margin - 71%

Revenue - $167m (c.4.5x market cap)

Earnings - $27.7m (roughly 15% margin & 28x market cap - industry average listed on Nasdaq is c.50x)

I will post a link to their IPO pack in the comments section - I have looked at the financials over and over, **I really struggle to see any negatives but if you find any, please can you leave a comment as I want to keep educating myself.**

**Bull Case - Top 4 Points**

Aggressive, rapid and consistent CAGR - in the 20% range. I absolutely love this, I know I'm down right now but my price target to exit this stock is around $45 as a low estimate. Even with the market performing badly, I am not worried about my investment here. It isn't speculative, they are delivering.

Big data - its been big for a long time, I'm convinced it will continue to be big in the future. They already generate 50 billion data points a month from their existing contracts. They are looking to get further integrated with the insurance market and second hand car sales. Knowing how people drive through their current offerings is going to be huge in selling products that instantly fit with the consumers goals. If they drive fast... maybe upsell the car and have an insurance package wrapped up to help seal the deal. If they are more conservative drivers but have a powerful car, sell something more appropriate. I think this is a major opportunity for the business.

The world is going to see more crime, insurance premiums are rising, people want more protection and Karo offer a service that fills this space. Yes, there is telematics competition but in the nicest possible way car theft in the regions they currently operate in is pretty high and in regions that they don't yet operate in. Factor this alongside how much crime will increase in a post covid world (due to poverty increasing), I think that their CAGR of 26% will be achieved. Rich get richer... poor get poorer etc, its sad but generally true. Those with money will want to protect their valued assets without risking their own personal wellbeing.

Businesses need what Karo are selling. Whether its AI controlled systems or human, fleet management want 99% plus optimisation, with Karo's growth and products on offer, they simply must be offering a high quality product. Live vision & fleet tracking is something I can see growing more and more. I know from personal experience of having to deal with a particularly painful Brexit, this would have been a life saver had all the fleet been managed in this way and could be traced at a click of a button. Integrated supply chains rely on this real time data, which to my disbelief doesn't currently exist throughout the world. Note - biggest single customer represents less than 2% revenue, so they are heavily diversified.

**Bear Case - Top 4 Points**

No major contracts in USA, Germany, France or UK. I don't know why, maybe it isn't in their strategy right now, but I'd really like to see them get a big contract in one of these regions. I'm sure it will come but it isn't there right now and although they may well do well in China - the markets I mention are strong and relatively stable compared to South Africa and current countries that they operate in.

Volume - its pretty low, the good news is... its a buyers market - the spreads aren't great, so would only enter with a limit order if you did decide to invest, be patient and I'd say no real need to click the ask button right now.

Competition - there is clear competition in the telematics industry, I'm not even going to try and counter this as its a basic fact. I have based my investment on the numbers I see in their investor pack, only you can decide whether these numbers are suitable for your investment and offer competitive value against other investment opportunities.

The number of risks listed in their SEC prospectus filing was pretty crazy - my positive spin on this is that they are aware of their risks, honest about them and have strategies to counter/mitigate against them. I'll post the link so you can check this out too, but please do before making a decision on whether to invest.

**Share Structure**

Relatively simple section - NASDAQ is the priority listing, total of c.21,000,000 shares - 20,000,000 held by insiders with a 180 day lock up. 9,000,000 listed on the JSE as in inwards listing.

Cartrack (KARO) used to be listed solely on the JSE - but due to expansion plans, has now listed on Nasdaq... it was listed the same day as UTME and genuinely believe a lot of investors missed this IPO due to the hype and price increase on UTME.

The company was previously valued at over $1 billion on the JSE and the CEO didn't sell any shares, as he went on record to say that he felt the company was worth at least $1.5 billion.

**Key Catalysts**

Earnings are due soon - I have spoken to their Investor Relations team and expected first week of May. I'm expecting that these are positive.

Covid risk lowering, more people returning to normal - cars left unattended in public places, more travel, more collisions, insurance going up and people using telematics to help reduce the total cost of car ownership.

The CEO has previously discussed how he believes cars will not be owned by individuals in the future and more fleet management will be required to make sure those in charge of a vehicle are driving responsibly. A lot depends on whether you share the same vision.

**AOB**

KRO was listed on the JSE today and traded up to $45 per share - the Nasdaq listing trading currently around $32 at the time of writing this.

mutq93,,investing,post,1618934752,"Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's handNew York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

mvrwv9,,investing,post,1619046533,"AYX is grossly undervaluedAlteryx added $43 million in net-new ARR in Q4 to end the quarter at $493 million, up 32% y/y - much faster than its revenue growth, and giving the company great visibility into its $555-$565 million revenue target for the upcoming year. Alteryx has also noted that it targets to end FY21 with $625 million in ARR, representing 27% y/y growth.
The company also drove significant cash flow growth in 2020. Full-year operating cash flows of $74.8 million grew 119% y/y, and represented a respectable 15.1% OCF margin that still leaves room for improvement in the coming year.

VERDICT: I'm banking on a macro rebound and IT departments' willingness to take on large transformational projects in 2021 as key drivers for a rebound in Alteryx stock. I think the opportunity to invest in Alteryx at <10x forward revenues and at half of where it was trading last year is a unique opportunity to bet on a fantastic big data stock. I also feel it in my balls that this is going to be a big one. 145 dollar price target for the FY!",

mv2u08,,investing,post,1618959805,"The belle of the ball? Bidding war begins as Canadian National jumps in with $34B offer for Kansas City Southern ($KSU)After last month's big news of [Canadian Pacific's ~$25B acquisition of Kansas City Southern](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma15h0/major_railroad_merger_canadian_pacific_is_buying/), a spanner has been thrown into the works as competitor Canadian National has come in with a better bid. Canadian National came out with the [details of the offer today](https://www.cn.ca/en/news/2021/04/cn-makes-superior-proposal-to-combine-with-kansas-city-southern/), which include $200 cash and 1.059 $CNI shares for each $KSU share, valuing $KSU at just about $325 as of market open. (This compares to CP's previous offer of $90 and .489 CP shares or about $275 for each $KSU share at time of offer.)

This new bid sets up a big potential struggle for the last major railroad outside the big 6. KCS would have to pay a $700M breakup fee to CP in order to accept another deal, but the offer from CN is significantly better. Both deals would still be subject to STB approval, which is uncertain, and CN may have an even harder time getting approval given some overlap with the existing KCS network.

Canadian Pacific has already [fired back in a statement](https://www.railwayage.com/freight/cn-counters-cpkc-with-a-superior-proposal/?RAchannel=regulatory):

> “CN’s proposal is massively complex and likely to fail,” CP said, guns blazing in a press release issued late on April 20. “[It] would create the third-largest Class I railroad [after UP and BNSF] and destabilize the competitive balance in the North American rail industry. The only combination involving KCS that is clearly in the public interest is the one that Canadian Pacific has proposed, which has already garnered support from more than 400 shippers and other stakeholders. While remaining the smallest of the six U.S. Class I railroads by revenue, a combination [of] CP and KCS creates stronger single-line competition against existing Class I routes.

KCS shareholders are likely feeling like the belle of the ball with multiple bidders now in the mix and the lurking potential of a bid from Union Pacific or even Berkshire Hathaway (BNSF). At minimum CP would likely have to improve their offer in order to see it accepted. $KSU was up 15% to $295.50 at the end of today's trading.","['BRK.B', 'KSU', 'BLL', 'UNP']"

muxxha,,investing,post,1618945936,"I think Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and ArchegosTo understand what’s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill’s insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I’m guessing it’s directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don’t have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I’ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse’s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don’t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won’t be pretty either way.

Now let’s talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don’t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos’s TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn’t justify the hit Credit Suisse’s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash – they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn’t have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn’t enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I’m confident I’m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. There are too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to act as a catalyst for more bad news, and the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market’s behavior over the past several days, I think it’s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I’m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss’s interaction with Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS’s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I’m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.

Edit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I won't tell you what to think, but I do want to give my personal thoughts. I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of ""adjusted"" and ""excluding significant items"" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a ton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term. This is a play that I believe will likely take several years to pay off.","['GS', 'VIAC', 'MS', 'DISCA']"

The automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery, despite the electronic chip shortage, and the construction, equipment and transportation sectors are also strong. Our order entry continues to be robust across our businesses, and when coupled with historically low inventories, supports continued strong steel selling values.

>We also believe U.S. trade policies and existing steel trade cases will continue to moderate steel imports.

Stocks are set to open lower today, with futures pointing to a drop of about 0.5% for major indexes. Small caps are off even more, with the Russell 2000 down 0.8%. That’s as of 0645 and follows a day of selling across the board.

There appears to be some profit taking going on after a strong week last week when the Dow and S&P closed at records.

We did get disappointing earnings from United Airlines yesterday and this is of course a proxy for the pandemic reopening trade. Almost all other major earnings reports have beaten estimates.

At the time of this writing, more reports came in with J&J beating on earnings and revenues. We’re due to hear from a bunch of other blue chips today, including Lockheed Martin, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and Netflix.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/) included qualitative thoughts. Part 2 includes my quantitative thoughts. Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company’s [S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788), website, [latest Q1 2021 report](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788), and [Meritech’s breakdown of Coinbase’s S-1.](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading)

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",

Coinbase's revenue growth will slow accordingly if crypto prices crash, or if the crypto-mania dies out. They also have no sustainable competitive advantage and will have to cut there trading fees sooner or later. There goes revenue growth and profits. Anyways, still great company, but the risks are massive, especially for it's 100 billion valuation.",
mu1z70,gv3e37x,investing,comment,1618847585,"Nice fundamentals.   I think COIN is probably the most compelling IPO of 2021 and the stock price could double more easily than a lot of other tickers out there.     

One question is how the stock will contend with the approval of a BTC ETF, if this occurs.   Right now, many COIN buyers want exposure to the crypto sector, but with the investor protections of a publicly traded equity.  A natural place for it is in a Roth IRA.   But, if a BTC ETF is approved (and that's a big if) wouldn't you rather have that instead?

An attractive feature of COIN's ""we sell shovels in this gold rush"" investment thesis is that buying it means you don't have to pick a winner in the crypto boom.  If BTC ends up #1, you make money, but you also make money if it's ETH, or if it's one of the touted Ethereum killers (if a coin they don't have like Solana really takes off, they will add it).

Maybe someone will find it usefull and i will find some new information here.  Also English its not my native language, sorry in advance for some mistakes. 

  
SPAR Group is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more. Its from their 10K.  


I screen stocks for their fundamentals and then, if i see something interesting there, iam going deeper.

**Lets see their multiples first:**

\- P/E 10,4x

\- P/B 1,1x

\- ROIC 26%

\- Net debt (- 2,7 mln $) ( they have more cash in their balance than debt).

\- Total debt/ CFO( cash flow from operations) = 1,5x. 

They have really good fundamentals and strong balance sheet. Also positive FCFF ( free cash flow to the firm).  

Their revenue  for 2020 was 230,5 mln $( 252,8 mln $ in 2019, - 9% YOY Growth). It consist of two majore sources. Revenue in United states was 92,1 mln $, International revenue 138,4 mln $.

  


| Net international revenue: | **2020** | YOY Growth |2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brazil| **49,940**|\-24%| 65,942|
|South Africa | **28,235** |4%| 27,201 |
|Mexico | **22,679**|\-3%| 23,324|
|China | **12,401** |\-5%| 12,993 |
|Japan | **9,273**|\-19%| 11,469 |
|India | **8,589**  |\-3%| 8,813   |
|Canada | **6,294** |\-31%| 9,059  |
|Australia | **988**  |\-68%| 3,087|
|Turkey|**-**|\-100%| 268  |
|Total international revenue|**138,399 (59,9% of revenue)**|\-15%| 162,156  (64,1% of revenue)|

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what.",

mtjvlt,,investing,post,1618774981,"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

mt2tfk,,investing,post,1618706696,"Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense InvestingI wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often.",['SPGI']

msaeih,,investing,post,1618600826,"Next week, the US cannabis industry is nearing its first major federal legislation milestone of the year. SAFE Act[**Marijuana Banking Bill Expected To Get A House Floor Vote Next Week, Sponsor’s Office Says**](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-banking-bill-expected-to-get-a-house-floor-vote-next-week-sponsors-office-says/)

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",['ED']

msaeih,gurip76,investing,comment,1618603932,Maybe *THIS* will make my weed stocks stop dropping.,
msaeih,gusgny2,investing,comment,1618620995,"I'm heavy in US Cannabis and my heaviest position is in Cresco. Just want to drop a little fundamental analysis here for you guys and expand on SAFE further. 

Bullish Arguments First: 

Currently, the Big 4 MSO's that you mentioned above are trading at a P/S ratio of near or about 7. Meaning their market caps are about 7x their 2020 Revenues. Cresco, specifically, is 6.88 P/S. To compare, CGC and APHA have a P/S of 26 and 9, respectively. MNST is a Consumer Packaged Good [CPG] that trades at about 11 P/S, although that's not a perfect comparison. I consider Cannabis a mix between Agriculture and CPG, so I chose MNST for a comparison with a more mature growth company. Now, a P/S near 7 isn't that crazy of a discount, since that's what more mature growth companies are trading near. However, that's not considering the exponential growth that each state brings in terms of sales. Each state has a TAM boost of maybe near 1-2 Billion. Each MSO had Year over Year growths of over 100% in sales. And the estimates for 2021 and 2022 remain over 100%. For example, Cresco has a 2022 estimated P/S of **2.5**. Meaning the stock price should 3-4 x to catch up to the 2022 P/S expectation. The estimates are fairly conservative, because they don't consider that the MSO's could potentially reach scale in NJ, NY, and other states that just legalized recreational cannabis. They also aren't fully considering the acquisitions being made and how they could boost revenues and the increased demand in states like Illinois (Did you see those sales numbers?! March had the highest sales OF ALL TIME). 

Talking about acquisitions, it helps lead me into my next point. The MSO's have been incredibly successful, but they've essentially had one arm tied behind their backs. They are forced to trade in Canadian markets and over the counter so their equity raises for acquisitions are heavily handicapped. They are also taxed heavy because Cannabis is linked to Section 280E. Not to mention, they don't even have access to banking yet, which is what SAFE will help with. Literally, they have cash block rooms for the IRS to collect taxes. There are a fair amount of headwinds they are running into, but they are still growing an incredible amount; not to mention that all the Big 4 are already generating positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of the Section 280 and federal handicaps they run up against.  None of the big Canadian players are generating positive EBITDA yet, for comparison, and they don't have to worry about the same federal headwinds. The problem, in my opinion, with the Canadians is Canada is one country, with population roughly equal to CA or TX, but with the entire US's worth of competition; there's also no limit on supply of Cannabis. Basic supply and demand, but more supply, less pricing power and lower the margins. The US limits licenses for legalized states so supply is topped. Illinois has the best blueprint, in my opinion, and they are being called the Silicon Valley of Weed. Just SAFE passing and getting off of [280E](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-irs-tries-to-collect-taxes-from-marijuana-companies-through-280e/) will create a massive earnings gap fill (earnings will legit near double). 

[Now what does SAFE do for us?](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/would-safe-banking-allow-msos-to-uplist-onto-major-u-s-exchanges-the-experts-weigh-in/) We already know it will pass House next week. We just need the 10 votes in Senate. There are a lot of different viewpoints on SAFE, but the most bullish is if it can help sway the US exchanges to allow for uplisting. Uplisting is the #1 catalyst we should look out for. This opens the door for institutions, ETF's, other fundies, even robinhooders to buy the stock. Right now I think most of them are buying the Canadians instead, which don't have real growth prospects in the US. They can't enter the US THC market and remain listed because it's illegal federally. So while they are doing their thing in Canada, the US MSO's are growing and scaling in key states. When it's federally legal, Canadians might try to enter, but they won't have the time or the equity to scale and compete. It sucks because they had to learn all the lessons the hard way, and now, the US names learned from their mistakes AND they get to keep the Canadians out while they grow and reach scale. It's actually quite fortunate for them the way it worked out. If Cannabis was legalized federally too quickly, the Canadians could have just used their sheer market cap to bully and acquire the US MSO's. 

I can go on all night, but I've spent a fair amount of time writing this up already. Let's briefly discuss the bearish viewpoints.

1) Congress. They could hold up legislation for Cannabis. Although SAFE is one that we should expect in 2021, decriminalization and federal legalization will take time. SAFE doesn't guarantee uplisting, but helps the % chance it can happen in 2021. Today there was news of a federal Bill that allows Veterans to carry legal medical Cannabis across illegal state lines. That's a pretty good start, if it can pass. 

2) Margin compressions. As the market for US Cannabis matures, companies will experience margin compression. Especially as more licenses are distributed. This probably doesn't happen for many years or until growth stales. 

3) ??? I'm sure there are more.

mspkyq,,investing,post,1618661515,"VT is not as global as I thought. For exposure that better matches GDP hold 1.37x VWO for every VTMy portfolio exclusively consists of Vanguard Total World Stock ETFs (VT and VWRL). I specifically invest in those because they give exposure to the world, instead of ETFs with a focus on the US, like VTI and VOO.

Or so I thought...

[VT has a market allocation of 57.1% to US and only 4.5% to China.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vt)

[In contrast, US makes up 24.2% of GDP and China 17.8%.](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/April/weo-report?c=512,914,612,614,311,213,911,314,193,122,912,313,419,513,316,913,124,339,638,514,218,963,616,223,516,918,748,618,624,522,622,156,626,628,228,924,233,632,636,634,238,662,960,423,935,128,611,321,243,248,469,253,642,643,939,734,644,819,172,132,646,648,915,134,652,174,328,258,656,654,336,263,268,532,944,176,534,536,429,433,178,436,136,343,158,439,916,664,826,542,967,443,917,544,941,446,666,668,672,946,137,546,674,676,548,556,678,181,867,682,684,273,868,921,948,943,686,688,518,728,836,558,138,196,278,692,694,962,142,449,564,565,283,853,288,293,566,964,182,359,453,968,922,714,862,135,716,456,722,942,718,724,576,936,961,813,726,199,733,184,524,361,362,364,732,366,144,146,463,528,923,738,578,537,742,866,369,744,186,925,869,746,926,466,112,111,298,927,846,299,582,487,474,754,698,&s=NGDPD,&sy=2019&ey=2021&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1)

[To adjust for this you can buy an ETF with a focus on China, e.g. VWO.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo)

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

[Sources and calculation can be found in this sheet.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5yv6O6-S6IHhiGF0OAySZ6_WTO1SL1U/view)

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this). If you then want to take the additional step of being overweight China equities broadly, something like VWO doesn't sound crazy.  And that step is an interesting debatable topic.",

I was thinking how in 2018 everyone was pessimistic about markets because equities were very expensive (by 2018 standards) and companies were loaded with debt. Also growth was slowing down and major companies were reporting lower earnings. Hard to believe but people were worried about Apple as it was selling less iPhones year over year. I remember we had quite a big crash in 2018 but then China saved us. Literally China saved out butts and prevented recession. Then things went as they did afterwards people were again complaining about how equities were very expensive and growth was slowing. There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that.

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['TWTR', 'AAPL', 'DISH', 'AMT', 'MS']"

I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

mru1gk,,investing,post,1618540606,"There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock marketHedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['TSLA', 'DE']"

One thing both the Trump and Biden administrations have agreed on is  that the U.S. needs to expand domestic manufacturing, and soon.

The  pharmaceutical industry in particular has outsourced much of its  manufacturing to take advantage of lower costs and more lax  environmental laws in other countries.

mrow7p,gunvqlb,investing,comment,1618528650,"Keep in mind this is highly anecdotal because it's just my opinion as a pharma chemist for over 10 years now, I've worked for a couple start-ups, a couple global top 5 corporations, and a few others like generics.

I don't think the problem is our production capabilities. It's really not too difficult for me to find a job, even in a lot of rural areas. If the government really wanted to they could use the defense production act to pump out assloads of covid vaccines. The problem lies in how the industry works these days.

The big boys - Pfizer, Merck, Bayer... - don't really do much true R&D anymore, it's a better business model for them to let the small fries do that and then just buy them. They have production capabilities but they're relatively limited because they're focused on high volume of specific formulations. As far as markets go, this is the glamorous biotech/pharma wealth and risk everyone is familiar with.

But there's a middle group too, and it's huge. There are thousands of mid-sized pharma companies that usually produce either generics or less profitable out-of-patent pharmaceuticals that are anything but glamorous. This is where America's production ability lies, but the problems with tapping it all stem from the corporate... ecosystem, I guess.

The big boys have the most cutting edge patents (and if they don't they buy them, like Pfizer did with BioNTech), so getting them to share with a handful or more mid-sized companies is difficult. But if you manage that the next issue arises in the meeting of two very different worlds; big pharma and still-tiny-but-not-startup-tiny pharma. It's been going very smoothly so far though, the only problem we've seen was with the Baltimore company making J&J's vaccine.

So to try and relate this to the stock market..... I guess Biden could incentivize big pharma to share important patents with mid-sized companies? Invest in Regeneron?

Maybe there's an etf that focuses on not just mid cap, but mid-range production (volume) companies but other than that I don't see a greater than average profit without getting lucky on a stock.","['UPS', 'MRK', 'PFE']"

mrmmk1,,investing,post,1618516360,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world. 

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

I think you are oversimplifying the demand component of this business. The managed care business was destroyed last year but the occupancy numbers are slowly ticking back up and will be back to normalized levels by next year. People don’t go to these facilities because they want to so the real issue was the quarantine and the lack of normal demand in the system. 

On the financial side of the equation, I think your operating revenue assumptions are also off. They got rid of the worst properties last year and most of the debt that you highlighted is long-term mortgage debt on the real estate. 

I am absolutely aware that they have some work to do but at an $85m market cap today they are easily worth 5x if they can get back on track. This is not guaranteed for sure but a great risk reward from the current price.

I didn't think it looked like a turnaround was coming up soon and passed it by.+ having a ridiculous rally recently doesn't mean anything on its own for any stock. It just got back to it's pre-crash levels. Since it was headed down pre-crash, maybe that does make for a good short entry, but I'd still thinking of it has having come DOWN to the low 40s.- I think your thesis about the loss of old folks is unlikely to hold up. Sure, we lost a bunch of them, but there were already too many.  People are on waiting lists for years, even decades, to get into senior housing. And, we all know that housing in general has a serious supply problem that isn't going away soon.- I guess I'd say compare its fundamentals to peers and base things on that, but also no reason to start a short against short-term momentum either, so now doesn't seem like the time.",

5 EV startups projected they'll hit $10b in revenue faster than Google, the current record holder for fastest to $10b.

Canoo touted a subscription model, an engineering services business, and a partnership with Hyundai.  On their first earnings call, they announced the Hyundai deal was dead, they were transitioning to developing IP for their own products (ie engineering services is dead), and that their subscription model wasn't actually financially viable.  And their CFO left.  One analyst asked if their CEO was still employed in the Q&A (lol).

Lordstown got caught juicing pre-orders.  BREAKING:  Steve Burns is still a hack.  This one shouldn't have surprised anyone...

Multiplan gave projections out to 2025 in the first half of 2020, before they merged.  As a public company, they gave no guidance for 2021 in their Q4 earnings call.

The sum of the revenue projections from Lidar startups that SPAC'd gives $4.6B in 2025.  The projected Lidar TAM in 2025 is \~$3.8B, and these companies have virtually 0 market share today.

Never trust an investor presentation from a SPAC target.",['IP']

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well.","['PYPL', 'AAPL', 'TSLA']"

mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrepwx,guny7b8,investing,comment,1618529894,"I think DISCA might be or in the near future be undervalued due to the dump and shorts. If you're willing to hold out then it could make you some money assuming it progresses normally.

My problem with DISCA lies in a few issues:

1. I think streaming will keep growing, but likely to see downturn post-covid.

2. Restriction of content and no benefit from reopening due to it lacking a movie studio or movie production line. T has Warner. NFLX is buying up studios left and right and recently started winning awards. VIAC has Paramount. Amazon has it's in house studio and can literally buy a studio if it wanted. 

3. It would be incorrect to assume that DISCA's previous highs are a guarantee of future highs or even return to those highs. It (along with VIAC) was runned up and pump by Archegos.

4. DISCA doesn't have other business arms to keep it fighting if the streaming war continues into a battle of attrition or if a sudden price-cutting war breaks out. T brings in tons of money from mobile, internet/phone lines, trad TV, and WarnerMedia that does movies. AMZN is a company that will be around for 100 years and it's making money on everything. NFLX is the incumbent and investors gives it the benefit of the doubt as a tech company and will keep buying even if it loses money every year (unlike DISCA). VIAC has a movie studio and a host of news outlets. DIS has a multiple media empire, MCU owns the movies, has theme parks, owns HULU, and sells toys to kids. Alphabet's youtube is already cash positive and will never go away. Comcast is like T and does telecommunications, movies, and news.

5. All these companies can package their stuff with other things. I get HBOMax free with my internet from T. I've been getting NFLX for $2/month with my T-mobile plan for years now. NFLX is the most popular subscription packaged with other subscriptions that people already use. AMEX Gold and higher cards get it for free. DIS+ is the 2nd most population ""added"" free subscription. AMZN gives it's streaming free as a bonus to prime shipping membership. Comcast gives it's for free with it's telecom offerings. ***What does DISCA package it's streaming with so that it's FREE?***

6. Average number of streaming services a person/family will have is 1-3. Very few will go past 4 or even 5. Now think about where DISCA will fit when [DIS, NFLX, and AMZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_services) are there locking up the top 3. Youtube is always free with streaming as a plus. It's left to fight for the scraps among Hulu, HBOMax, Peacock, Viacom, and AppleTV & other lesser rivals.

7. Content. I don't think Discovery even has the advantage on content. [NFLX/DIS/T/VIAC all beat it in content.](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/ranking-best-original-content-streaming)

8. Moat. There's no moat in the industry. If there was one then it's NFLX's name and the ability to package other services which I mentioned in 5. We're already oversaturated BEFORE factoring new entrants both in the states, Europe, and China.

I won't tell you to NOT buy DISCA. I just think it's a small fish in a crowded and ever-tightening pool of sharks. I've been in GOOG and T for years. The only reason I don't sell T is because I'm just pocketing dividends of the TELECOM company I bought. Not for the streaming. If I were to do some pickup I'd take VIAC over DISCA. 

I am also interested on your opinion on my assessment.","['AMZN', 'CMCSA', 'DISCA', 'VIAC', 'DIS', 'GOOGL', 'NFLX']"

Looking forward to reading the reports of the other financial institutions reporting today and later this week. Other than the permabears, the news on the economic recovery has been seemingly unanimously good. I think that well-capitalized banks, lowered reserve ratios, and the recent fiscal policy on infrastructure/modernization spending (e.g., digital health, climate change, science and technology research) all point towards more lending/financing of growth areas.

Wells Fargo & Co. said earnings soared in the first three months of the year after the bank released some of the money it put aside for bad loans earlier in the pandemic.

The San Francisco-based lender on Wednesday posted a profit of $4.74 billion for the first quarter, up from $653 million a year earlier. A year ago, Wells Fargo and other big banks set aside billions of dollars to prepare for a coronavirus recession, hammering their profits at the time.

Per-share earnings were $1.05, beating the 71 cents forecast in a FactSet poll of analysts.

Wells Fargo said it had revenue of $18.06 billion, up 2% from $17.72 billion a year earlier. That beat the $17.52 billion expected by analysts.",['WFC']

Will BABA stocks ever get to the moon? According to Aikya, the upside is extremely fraught with accounting issues detrimental to minority shareholders (99.99% of Redditors). I definitely think the Aikya report is worth a read for BABA investors.

Related party transactions and acquisitions have been a matter of habit for the Alibaba Partnership. In April 2014, Alibaba gave Simon Xie a $1 billion loan which he used to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media5 through an entity that was jointly owned by Jack Ma and Simon Xie. Alibaba claimed that they were not able to invest in Wasu Media directly because of Chinese regulations and that investing through Mr. Xie’s entity was the only way. In fact, Alibaba has regularly invested alongside Yunfeng Capital, a Shanghai based private equity company that was established by Jack Ma in 2010. The list of such related party transactions runs long and as recently as 2019 Alibaba Pictures gave a $103 million loan to struggling film studio Huayi Brothers Media in which Jack Ma has a considerable stake6. The lines between Alibaba’s shareholder interests and Jack Ma’s personal interests are very blurry, and at odds with our philosophy of backing clean and well aligned ownership structures.

Since Alibaba’s IPO, the asset base has grown tenfold from $18 billion to $185 billion or 48% per year.

However, this asset growth has mostly been driven by acquisitions and self-reported asset revaluations. Between 2014 and 2020, Alibaba has expanded their balance sheet by $92 billion in relation to equity investments (incl. goodwill recognised). In the same period, the ROAs have dropped from 26% to 13% and ROIC has fallen from 33% to 8%.

Alibaba management justifies these acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015, Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197. Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after four years in the red8.

Some of these acquisitions are in fact so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project10.",

Go to hour 9 minute 30 for his spiel as all the information is pulled from his testimony. Ticker is CRK .

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

Going to buy options around Q1 earnings date (May 4th, 2021). May the Fourth be with us research monkeys! :)",['NI']

Just a single (and possibly uninformed) perspective, but that has not been my experience working at a f100 financial services firm. We have multiple complex proprietary processing systems that we've spent tens of millions on, multiple large-scale data warehouse (each with thousands if not tens of thousands of tables), and a whole supporting cast of upstream, intermediate, and reporting systems. These systems are diverse, some proprietary, some purchased, and they have been stood up over decades. It takes our IT group many months to create or even modify integration between legacy systems. We have a small army of IT folks and have thrown an awful lot of cash at several top-tier consulting groups and none have had a magic bullet. Every RFP response promises nirvana, and all scale expectations once they open the hood understand the scale of our data issues.   

If these guys have a way to efficiently unify/link and homogenize diverse datasets, it is a very big deal and worth alot of money. Especially if they have found a way to structure unstructured data effectively, as they claim.

Analyst coverage: “We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within  the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical  footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply  revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe  there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level  legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a  unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and  offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential  legalization of iGaming in the United States.""

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections and factoring in debt and dilution.
2. From  published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,  bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.  Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to  fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected  10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

Recent signals of Blackstone/CVC’s long-term hold beyond lockup expiration:

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler : “We believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

SEC filed FTAC’s Board of  Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward.”

&#x200B;

Edit:  Looking at the bear case to justify recent price action but it becomes very hard to do when Paysafe has substantially positive free cash flow at $362 million, healthy revenue growth, and strong EBITDA growth.

Even looking at a basket of the poorest performing fintechs with much slower revenue growth or even negative revenue growth, negative EBITDA and negative cash flow, the lowest possible average of that basket of multiples would put Paysafe’s share price at $15.43. There is no reasonable way to argue that Paysafe is worth even that little.

For example:

Paysign has negative revenue growth (-30.4%), negative EBITDA margin and  negative EBITDA growth, and yet it trades at a higher EV/REV multiple of 8.5X. This would put Paysafe 15% higher at $15.20.

Shift4 reported only 4.8% y-o-y rev growth, with negative  cash flow, negative EBITDA growth and much higher debt to equity but it  still trades at EV/REV of 10.6x. This puts Paysafe SP at $18.88.

Shift4's EV/EBITDA multiple of 51.56X would put Paysafe SP at $31.29.


Unlike most other fintech companies, Paysafe has very large exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, which have been very hard hit during Covid.  When we look at other brick-and-mortar payment processors like Visa and Mastercard, we can see that, during this time, Paysafe has performed extremely well by comparison:

-- Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

-- Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

The averaged EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors with negative revenue growth would put Paysafe’s share price at $25

Their EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $48




Another measure:
Fintech competitors with negative EPS:   Repay:  -0.67,  Affirm :  -2.18,  Nuvei : -1.08,   Paysign : -0.19.  Bill :  -0.62,  Shift4 : -0.43 
 
Average EV/EBITDA multiples of above would put Paysafe's SP at $69





Paysafe excluded expansion of US iGaming from its growth projections even though ”roughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe.""  Considering that an analyst with a $19 PT said, ""we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of  state-level legalization of iGaming,""  it would seem that an upgrade to growth guidance and price target is in the making.

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US)’s first product unveiling of 2021 will take place on April 20, the company said on Tuesday.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant dubbed the event “Spring Loaded” in a media invitation. Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business.","['TWTR', 'AAPL', 'FB']"

mr23mr,,investing,post,1618440740,"My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?",['TSLA']

So I’ve been putting the bulk of my portfolio into safe SPY another other ETFs of the like. But I was reading about some equal weighted ETFs (RSP, EUSA, EWMC, EWSC) that have me thinking that I may be leaving potential growth on the table by not diversifying into them. I do know that the equal weighted ETFs tend to suffer more during big dips, so was researching different investment strategies about it. I’m not quite sure if it is the smartest choice to properly expose myself to the smaller stocks.

mr3c8y,gujsw6r,investing,comment,1618445334,"If the case for equal weighted funds is so that you have more small cap exposure because small cap outperforms large cap, then it becomes a discussion on factors - specifically the size factor.

If you want more risk-adjusted return, equal weighting doesn't give you adequate exposure to the size factor.

You need a small-cap fund that filters out small-cap growth stocks, because historically they actually have a negative total return. You want a small-cap value fund ideally.

If the case for equal weighting is that you don't like FAANG and think tech is overvalued/the next tech bubble is about to burst, well, if you hold VTI and VXUS you're diversified, and that's the best you can do fundamentally. Otherwise you are moving into the realm of investor ""tastes"", which also doesn't have a good risk-adjusted return rate.",
mr3c8y,guk5tp9,investing,comment,1618452008,"Maybe I'm weird, but I start thinking about costs.

Equal weight ETFs need to be continuously re-balanced with market movements changing the weights of the individual stocks.  This means that you'll constantly be losing money to the Bid-Ask spread.  Additionally, the ETF manager will generally charge a higher fee as they have to do more work to constantly maintain the equal weighting.  

Overall, these are small but continuous losses that you're essentially paying to keep the position weighted equally.",

Recent events:

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

Share buybacks: 20% of outstanding shares have already been bought back and recently they were authorized to buy back $300m worth of shares.

Multiples:

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

TTM Revenues: 6.47b (55 per share), with about 4.5% profit margins.

2022: 2.05 (7)

2023: 2.57 (2)

2024: 3.16 (1)

mqy9tn,,investing,post,1618429220,"Vicinity Motor Corp/Grande West Transportation TSXV: $VMC OTC: $BUSXD - Significantly undervalued with amazing growth opportunities ahead Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&t=454s&ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.
* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting
* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.
* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

It assumes that after the asset price doubling (from $11 to $22), the costs to mine the same quantity of bitcoin stays constant. This may be approximately true with gold. But with bitcoin, the difficulty of mining scales with the number of miners, which in turn scales with the price of the asset to maintain an equilibrium.

So in actuality, after the asset price doubling, it is much more likely to cost $20 to mine $22 worth of bitcoin. Profit margin stays the same as just buying and holding the asset.",

mq6e0u,guf9wli,investing,comment,1618353614,"So this is oversimplified to the point of probably being inflammatory, but here I go:

Firstly, our entire economy, not just the stock market, is predicated on the assumption that growth can and must continue infinitely. All credit and lending is based on the ideal that the supply of money will grow, allowing borrowers to pay off loans with interest and still come out ahead. The stock market's pyramid-ish tendencies are therefore not a risk unique to the stock market.

Secondly, it's my opinion that the U.S. government, and the corporations it is beholden to, are simply never going to let the stock market crash long-term if they can do anything at all to prevent it. That doesn't mean the bull market is infinite, but it means that on a long enough time horizon there are only two possible things that will follow a massive crash:

1) Investors who were properly diversified, and who have the time, cash buffer, and fortitude to hold and ride out the crash will eventually regain the value they lost (which was only ever lost on paper), and investors who have capital on hand to keep buying will make even more profit. 

2) The stock market never recovers, which can only mean the U.S. government as we know it has essentially collapsed, and at that point the fact that your portfolio is worth nothing is probably not your biggest concern.

Historically recessions facilitate more transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, because even though the wealthiest lose the most during a recession initially, the effect is temporary and they still have enough liquid capital on hand to buy up a bunch of assets at a discount from sellers who are hard pressed enough for short-term cash to sell at a loss. 

Bottom line, here's the secret to success: Diversify your investments, increase your cash allocation as you approach an age where you may not have the luxury of waiting for a recovery to play out, buy assets during recessions if you can, and hope that the government doesn't allow income inequality to get bad enough that the guillotines come out.",

inflation is raising slower than money is going in, so is there just more money being pumped into the economy without inflation occurring at the same amount?

if the US population is to stop growing will the stock market stop consistent growth too?

That last question is kind of the conclusion i've reached but have no idea if its right or not, and I feel stupid asking that, but it literally doesn't make sense where all the money is coming from, for over 100 years, consistent growth... how?",

mw32gn,gvfoep1,StockMarket,comment,1619093379,"Make sure you’re not thinking of the stock market in a bubble. The US stock market isn’t the same as the US economy. Many stocks in the market are global and derive value outside of the US economy so it’s not purely tied to US inflation/GDP/growth. Companies can gain value from operations in emerging markets. Economy and GDP are tied to employment and production. Companies w/ publicly traded stocks can create value out of “nothing” think about NFLX (or any FAANG stock for that matter) NFLX isn’t worth what it’s worth because it’s equal to some function of the money put into the business - they create a concept and created value and a need that didn’t exist before.

The stock market is also speculative - it trades on expected future value. The economy is valued as it is currently.

mvweih,,StockMarket,post,1619062316,"UWMC one of the best darkhorse stocks? Can't seem to think of a serious downside to this stock at the current price given the dividend.I've had my eye on UWMC for awhile as it's trended down to just below its current price of $7.40. At that price I can't come up with a serious downside to the stock and am curious if anybody out there is seriously bearish on it and give a counter to my conclusion. 

Basically, UWMC's quarterly dividend is $0.10 which, at its current price, gives a yield of 5.4%. The S&P 500's average dividend yield is 2%. In essence, UWMC has a current dividend yield double that of normal blue chip stocks.

Additionally, UWMC has only about 100 million Class A shares that are dividend eligible. Thus, it's dividend payout quarterly is $10 million, or $40 million annually. 

UWMC is a profitable company and, in normal times before COVID, it's net earnings in 2019 were over $400 million. In 2020, during the unique mortgage times, its earnings were $3.38 billion.

Thus, even acknowledging 2020 was very unique in profitability, even during normal times UWMC's dividend is incredibly affordable. In essence, UWMC's dividend should be safe for the foreseeable future.

Also, the existence of the dividend should set a minimum floor for UWMC. If, for example, it went down to $5 it would be an 8% dividend which I would think most investors would have to jump at. Realistically I expect the floor to be $7 as it's already double that of most blue-chip stocks. 

Which leaves me with what's the downside of UWMC? It's a well-established profitable company and isn't going bankrupt anytime soon. Has a good dividend yield already. Has a market cap that once it qualifies for S&P inclusion it probably should be included. What are the reasons not to just dump a bunch of money in it and, if it takes a while to go up, you'll be getting a hefty dividend in the interim.",['SPGI']

Ex Shell asset that they already spent £37 miillion in development , including the Chuditch-1
Discovery well

Their initial assessment of those leads near on 6 TCF of GIIP with much upside across
the wider license (Standard conversion 1 TCF = 170 Million BOE)

Shell drilled CH-1 in only 26 days if I remember at a cost of $8 million 
So potential rapid FFD

Timor Leste appear to have now done a U turn on Sunrise and all now to be processed
and the Woodford/other massive new refinery/LNG complex at Darwin, if you look at the
map/link (few mins ago) 

Darwin already has a gas pipeline all the way from Darwin to Bayu Undan Gas field, the short
join the dots tie in of Sunrise to Bayu Undan would come right past us, giving us an even
shorter tie in to that production pipeline

In recent weeks several licenses have sprung back into action after years of delays due to the
politics, now all resolved, with multiple drills planned including by Santos and our own 
London Listed Adv Advance with another Aussie Carnarthon?

As part of the new license round TGS (Norway a world leader) commenced 2d cubed seismic over
the entire area 50,000 square KM, the first data according to its website last year was to be end of
July and all by October for viewing in a data room - bids for round to close late October

The Government in September announced the licences which where to be awarded in December
and issued in January was now being delayed to give bidders more time

Our now 85% owned Sundagas has been a leading contributor and organiser of multiple
local TL events and Oil and Gas conferences assisting the local NOC with CGG, so the expectation
was we might also GET one of the new bid licenses 

NOW
24th March we announce the current churn placing to take 85% of SundaGas equity
WHY NOW, we attempted to RTO them 100% shortly after they stole the license on the
cheap , nepotism lol, one of the 2 directors who invented and listed SG on the Singapore
exchange , related to one of our own BOD :))))

We in a tough market at the time could not raise sufficient funds and just took 33%
as said so why now the rush perhaps 

25/26th March - 3rd Timor Leste Oil and Gas Conference (this time online)
Again SG and CGG heavily involved and original announcement was 25th
then became a two day event (hmm)

Two agenda items of note
A major presentation by Sundagas on the Chuditch discovery and the prospects 
within the full license area
CGG had 2 big slots but most interesting the title on the 2nd slot
A presentation on the super resolution Seismic and the prospects it has revealed !!!

This surely could only be referring to the 2020 TGS 2D 50,000 sq KM data?

TGS are now currently reprocessing the 3d that includes our block and has been made
available to SG

Disney also secured rights to offer hundreds of older Sony films much sooner, including ""Jumanji"" and ""Hotel Transylvania."" The company said it will add a significant number of Sony titles to Hulu starting in June. Disney and Sony stocks open higher on Tokyo exchange.

Interesting timing right after Netflix missed subscriber earnings. With Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN , NFL, and parks having reopened may see strong numbers next month and increased guidance if they feel they've taken a market share.

Personally long on DIS as it's a reopening, tech, entertainment play all in one and I like their strong following on Wandavision, Mandalorian, and Marvel universe related content.

mvp0uf,,StockMarket,post,1619037959,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 21, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 21, 2021**

Stocks reversed on Monday, rising on Wednesday for the first day in three sessions, with small-caps leading the way after a terrible run of performance in April. Despite Netflix (NFLX) sharply missing earnings expectations in terms of new paid subscribers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), while the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) remain near record levels. 

After a recent spike this week, the CBOE Volatility Index sank back to near 52-week lows, a sign that investor risk appetite is increasing. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.”

While Netflix (NFLX) sharply missed estimates, this earnings season has largely blown consensus estimates out of the water, with more than 81% of companies that have reported so far beating earnings expectations, according to a study by FactSet. However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks (apart from today) have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies. 

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.
* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). 
* Ford Motor (F) is planning more downtime at five North American factories due to a global semiconductor shortage. 
* During yesterday’s virtual event, Apple (AAPL) announced a new slate of products set to include the companies own chip. The offering includes a new iMac, a new iPad, and a new tracking-device called Airtags.
* Gisele Bündchen, supermodel and Tom Brady’s wife was announced as a special advisor for the CEO and board of directors in DraftKings. This is just the latest in a series of high-profile moves by DraftKings to establish itself as the premier sport-betting company. 
* After gapping up after earnings, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) joined the ranks of healthcare companies worth $100 billion or more
* After a series of high profile accidents including small children, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission advised consumer to not buy the treadmill if there are small kids or pets at home.This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector. In response, Peloton (PTON) called the statements “inaccurate and misleading” and refused calls to recall their treadmill. The stock has been in freefall this week.

This is a big reason why companies kept working on their vaccines even when it became clear that several early ones would beat them to market by many months: because this is a vaccine that we'll need for a long, long time, and not just 1 year.

mw1c31,,StockMarket,post,1619085301,"The surging EV section | The logic behind the rise of 04/21 | ArkInvest substantially adjusted its positionsHello everyone, this is DK.

# Tesla in the tuyere of public opinion

**$TSLA** These days are caught up in the brake failure of the Shanghai Auto Show in China and the deflagration in Texas in the United States. DK told you on the 19th that if Tesla plummeted that day, it would be an opportunity to increase your position. Whether it is traditional diesel locomotives and EV new energy vehicles, the tragic events of braking and spontaneous combustion always exist. We should pay more attention to the accident rate, and all the behaviors that put aside the dose and talk about toxicity are playing hooligans. So DK judged that the fundamentals of Tesla have not changed, and all the sharp falls are opportunities for us to increase our positions on the premise that they are basically good. DK is still Tesla's diamond hand!

# Li Auto Inc. in the eyes of car reviewers

Here, let me show you a short video first.

[$LI](https://reddit.com/link/mw1c31/video/bf8zsvzd1pu61/player)

Let's put aside our emotions, whether you are long or short in **$LI** We all need access to more comprehensive information to help you adjust or maintain your investment strategy. 

DK thinks that EV is absolutely in the right direction in new energy vehicles at present. From a macro point of view, although hydrogen energy has the advantage of battery life, it has higher cost and more serious pollution in the process of hydrogen production, and there is more loss in the process of electric energy from manufacturing to consumer use. On the other hand, the most imaginative thing in the EV section is still Tesla, and DK believes that when making investment choices, one track layout and one of the best companies is sufficient, unless you are doing ultra-short-term trading.

# ArkInvest adjust positions

Many people think that the risk of the current ARK fund is too high, let's do some analysis first.  


It can be said that the return on ArkInvest investment is not directly related to ARK itself. ARK only charges a management fee of less than 1%. If Cathie Wood is not optimistic about the growth stocks she now holds, she can switch to stable, less risky technology heavyweights. What do ordinary investors pay most attention to when investing in funds? It must be past performance. ARK's performance last year was enough for them to sit for three or five years.  


Cathie Wood is still actively laying out growth stocks, so it can be seen that the future they see is the cognitive boundary of our ordinary investors. So our attitude should be to embrace actively, analyze calmly and hold firmly. The premise of holding firmly is that you know the company behind the ticker symbol of your position.

# Why did the stock market rise yesterday?

In fact, making an investment is the same as doing a company's business, it should be sensitive to data. Why rise, why fall, we need to give ourselves a reason, and then constantly verify their own judgment. DK believes that yesterday's short positions were closed, friends can take a look at their own position time chart, as long as there are stocks that began to rise at 9:45 in the day, they must have been shorted some time ago.

Since March 15, a large number of short orders have been laid out, and now they have basically made a profit of about 90%. The media all say that everyone has seen the overfall in Buy the deep lead to a rise. DK can tell you that ordinary investors do not dare to enter this position by a large margin, nor do long institutions, and only short-selling institutions are reasonable. So it's only a matter of time and way to break the new high. DK mentioned before that only when technology heavyweights lead the Nasdaq to break new highs can it be healthy, otherwise everyone can stop making profits.

# Cathie Wood big action

**$PLTR** *increases* the position of more than 1 million shares.

**$TSP** *increased* the position of 730000 shares.

**$DKNG** *increases* the position of more than 500,000 shares.

mvor9e,,StockMarket,post,1619037199,"Did a lot of shorts get punished today? Lots of 4%-7% gainers after starting negative this morning.Today, Apr 21, 2021, started out with the negative sentiment that we had yesterday. Just about everything was down. The futures just before open were negative, while the anti-NASDAQ ETF $QID started today positive and went up about 2%.

But then something changed about 1-2 hours into trading and just about everything reversed. Not only did stocks turn positive, but many had pretty significant gains.

I noticed that stocks with already-high short interest had some of the highest gains today, which I think came from the fact that many short investors were certain that today was to be a down day, so bet against the already highly-shorted stocks this morning. But when the prices rose, they had to cover, which means buying back shares today and just accepting their losses, or hoping for gains as the prices rise to make up for their losses.

I'd like to know what's going on with these markets. Over the past weekend there were articles in the business press about us being at a peak, May being a month where retailers cash out and go enjoy the summer, many stocks are overbought, etc. 

But then some articles today said that people were just taking in profits yesterday and that's all that was happening to cause the drop and now people are back in.

But if it was just people taking in profits, why does it appear that there was very active short selling against highly shorted stocks this morning? How could so many people not know what's going on? Or maybe I'm just wrong and the highly shorted stocks just happened to rise so much by chance today?",['NDAQ']

I have absolutely no interest in charging for the use of the bot, but in the future I plan to leave an option for donations to help with the monthly payment of the server and the information it consumes (currently it is about 35 USD per month in total).

The use is very simple, just type in a discord channel ""$ticker"", either a stock or a cryptocurrency, and the bot will answer you. You can also talk to it privately and it will answer you via chat. Use it all you want, but please be aware that I am still testing what it does and how well it does it.

At the moment I don't have the list of supported cryptocurrencies and stocks, but you are free to try the ones you want. The call in case of cryptocurrencies is ticker+currency to convert. Example: the $BTCUSD. I hope to have the list during this or next week if all goes well.

To use it I leave you the link with which you can invite it to your servers, I have several interesting ideas for the future that I hope to be able to fulfill.

I'd love to know people's opinions on this stock (I've already bought some stock in it already)

Party City......

No one is talking about the Party City stock. It's low....granted this time last year it was at .02 and it's about 6 dollars now. 

I'm guessing it can only go up.  

If you look at the history it tends to go up right before a holiday and go down right after a holiday.

Specifically the biggest drop usually happens around Nov 10th....I guess you would think wouldn't it drop after New Years.....it does drop a bit but it just pops back up before Valentine's day....

Considering not just the holidays coming up we weren't able to celebrate last year....I've read alot of people calling the upcoming time period the roaring 20s....

What happened in the roaring 20s? PARTIES.....I imagine there will even be a Party City....

With the talk of history said, be aware...after the roaring 20s comes the great depression. 

I think this stock is good for now because of all of the possibilities stated above.

But I'd love to know the opinion of others...! Does what I say above make sense? I know you can only TRY to predict the market but this feels like a very cut and dry theory. Or....I could just as easily be naïve. All opinions welcomed",['NOV']
mvq2fg,gvdit22,StockMarket,comment,1619042241,"I’d be more concerned that you’ve been studying stocks for the past couple of years and your justifications are that of a speculator not an investor which is fine but it’s gambling and don’t try and trick yourself into thinking it isn’t. Stock choice aside.

“Can only go up”, “No one is talking about it”, “historical it did well therefore it must in the future”, roaring 20s? Parties? We are in a pandemic..., just because 1930s was a depression doesn’t mean 2030 will be. The last 2 market crashes were bailed out and although it did put people out of work and a lot lost money it didn’t cause a depression. 

Where is your analysis on the company’s financials? What’s their debt? Cashflow? Underlying assets? Is the industry growth or will it be made redundant by further advancement. Just because parties happen doesn’t mean an individual company will do well. What’s the intrinsic value of the company? What’s your target buy and sell price? What’s your investing strategy? Value? Momentum?

Ask yourself these questions, if you can’t answer them then you are speculating on a “feeling” and your “untrained” view, as in you haven’t lost really money in the market as though you are scared of something, money is made regardless of stocks going up and down. It’s about your position and ability to adjust to changes. 

There are people with 20+ years experience and full financial education who get it wrong. There was a chimpanzee with a 200% roi portfolio, no one can guarantee returns. You might of picked a good stock but remember this.

When do you actually cash in your shares during the big POP to get the maximum return? That answer depends on how many shares you own.

GOOD ADVICE: don't sell on the way up, sell just after the peak.
The problem is, we have no idea what the actual real peak will be. 

There will be fake outs, over and over again, think of it as steps, but you don't know how many steps there are. We also don't know how many days or weeks this will take to unwind.

If you only own a few shares, your best bet is to wait for a high number you like and go for it. Possibly leaving 1 share to see how high it goes.

If you own a large number of shares your better off spacing out your cash in point over different price points. That way your chances of getting a good price is much higher.  Leave a few shares in just to see what happens.

THE BIG UNKNOWNS:
1) how long the process will last, days, week's?
2) how high the price will go.

How is Bitcoin not futile? - r/Cryptocurrency didn't like this and deleted it multiple times, probably because I told them something they didn't like lolRelative newbie but have been researching Bitcoin lately. The long-term  costs of  transaction seem to make it such that there is a both a  decreasing   incentive to mine Bitcoin and a decreasing incentive to use  Bitcoin.   Both of which making Bitcoin futile in the long-run.

Specifically,   in order for Bitcoin to exist there need to be enough  active miners to   verify the blockchain and incorporate the new  transactions into a new   block. Each time a block is mined and added to  the block chain the  miner  that did so gets a present bonus of 6.25  Bitcoin. We'll call that  bonus  the Bitcoin Bonus.

The   miner also gets transaction fees that people transacting  Bitcoin set to   give an incentive for miners to prioritize their  transaction. We'll   call that the Transaction Bonus.

Since   there are a maximum number of Bitcoins that can be in  existence, 21   million, the Bitcoin Bonus decreases by half  approximately every 4 years   and trends to zero.

Thus,  in  effect, the Bitcoin Bonus must trend to zero meaning that,  when that    occurs, or when the Bitcoin Bonus is sufficiently small as  to be   neglible, the only incentive for Bitcoin mining will be the  Transaction   Bonus.

That  means that in order  to be economically feasible over the long  term, the  transaction fees,  or the Transaction Bonus, must be more  than the costs  of mining Bitoin.  In other words, in order for there to  be an incentive  to mine Bitcoin  over the long run, the Transaction  Bonus miners get  must exceed the  costs of mining Bitcoin.

The main, long-term continuing cost of mining Bitcoin, excluding the capital to actually buy the miners, is electricity.

Currently,   looking online, a Bitcoin Antminer consumers 1.50 kW per  hour and most   miners, presumably, are run 24 hours a day.  This gives  an energy   consumption of 1,080 kWh/month/bitcoin miner.

Average global energy rates, per Google are, 0.14 cents/kWh.

This means it takes $151.20 to run one Bitcoin miner per month.

Per this website - [https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/)\- ,which it appears is only a couple months old, Slushpool has  200,000   miners equating to 12% of the Bitcoin mining network. Thus,  100% of  the  network would be 1.667 million Bitcoin miners.

Accordingly,   with 1.667 million miners running, at $151.20 per  Bitcoin miner per   month to run, that gives energy costs for the entire  network of $252.05   million per month. In other words, it costs  $252.05 million per month  in  electricity costs alone to run the  Bitcoin mining network.

Thus,   in the long-run with the Bitcoin Bonus going to 0, that means  the   Transaction Bonus, the amount Bitcoin miners make for keeping the    network going, must amount to at least $252.05 million per month in    order to make it economically feasible to mine Bitcoin and keep the    network going.

Now, per [Blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com/),   each  block added to the blockchain contains about 2.1k transactions.   And, a  block is added to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes. There   are  43,200 minutes in a month, which translates to the Bitcoin network    processing 9.071 million transaction per month.

So,   9.071 million transactions are procesed per month, and it costs   $252.05  million per month to process those transactions. Thus, the   minimum  processing fee per transaction, in order to make it   economically  feasible for the network to run, needs to be **$27.78 per transaction**.

Notably,   this is what the Bitcoin transaction costs are trending  towards in the   long-term. That is, there is currently a Bitcoin Bonus  for mining but   that is continually decreasing. Put in other words, the  incentives for   mining are decreasing as the Bitcoin Bonus goes away  leaving only the   Transaction Bonus as the incentive for mining. Thus,  with the Bitcoin   Bonus decreasing, the reward for mining is decreasing  meaning the   transaction costs are trending up towards the $27.78 per  transaction fee   indicated above.

This   effectively prices out all normal, every-day transactions.  Want to   spend $5 on a beer in Bitcoin? You need to pay $27.78 to do  so. Want to   spend $100 on groceries in Bitcoin, you need to spend an  extra 27.78%  in  transaction fees to do so.

Add   to this the fact that it currently takes 10 minutes to verify a    transaction it makes normal, every-day transactions essentially    untenable for Bitcoin. High transaction fees and merchants would have to    wait 10 minutes for the transaction to be verified to give you your    beer, give you your groceries, etc.

With   normal transactions out-of-the picture, that essentially  defeats a   large theme of the proponents of Bitcoin. That it will be  the currency   of the future, widely used, widely adopted, etc.

Instead,   the only way Bitcoin is really feasible is for large  transactions,   likely international transactions, and transactions  where the parties   want to be anonymous.

In  essence,  you're effectively left with the only incentive to keep  the  Bitcoin  network alive is for international money-laundering, lol.

Not   to say that the Bitcoin network will die since there will  always be   illegal activity and, thus, a need for an anonymous  money-laundering   network. But as far as Bitcoin being the currency of  the future, it   seems pretty futile.

Not  to  mention that if it were to actually be widely adopted and  the common   currency for everyday use, governments would almost  certainly outlaw   it. Governments need money to function - e.g., pay  for road,   infrastructure, schools, police, etc. - and, if their  citizens are using   a monetary base that is anonymous and untrackable,  governments will   have no way to assess and collect taxes and, thus,  governments will be   unable to function. Thus, governments would have  to outlaw it to the   extent it actually became a mainstream currency.

That is, from both an economic and regulatory perspective Bitcoin seems futile in the long-run.

Too long, didn't read: Bitcoin futile. Economic costs too high. Governments will regulate it away.",['GOOGL']

mvd9na,,StockMarket,post,1619003137,"Bullish on Enphase Energy - 5 Year Growth - $ENPHNASDAQ: ENPH

Current Share Price (as of 4/16): $150.01

5 year price target

* Low: $255.62; ROI: 70.4%
* High: $277.21; ROI: 84.8%

**Thesis I: Natural Disasters Highlight ENPH’s Importance**

**Competition:**

* Tesla has created more than 100 megawatts of energy storage 40 miles outside of Houston

**Uniqueness:**

* Enphase’s technology is more focused on the needs of individual homeowners 
   * Plenty of room for growth in this space regardless of the competition in utility-level/large scale battery storage space
* Grid-agnostic technology - IQ 8

**Opportunity:**

* Enphase’s micro inverter technology stands to grow from the exposure provided by the grid failure
* Texas Attorney General’s office investigations into Texas Electrical Companies
   * Consumers are losing faith in current companies
   * New opportunity for competitors to enter the energy market
* In times of disaster, the price of electricity shot up from $18 to $300 per megawatt hour  

   * Natural gas went up as much as 4000%

Enphase experienced a drop in stock prices that corresponds with the grid failures in Texas. Since this drop, the stock has been able to regain some of its value, but it has not been able to completely regain its original value. This has been an overreaction on the part of the market due to increasing distrust in energy sources. The rising yield rates coupled with the power outages in Texas created a scenario in which the stock prices for enphase were being unrealistically decreased.

**Thesis 2: Unprecedented, Favorable Political Environment**

Favorable Policy Desires from President Biden as well as Political Consensus for Renewable Energy foreshadow an incredibly advantageous environment for ENPH’s growth and wider integration in our near future post-Covid.

* President Biden has included a 10-year extension for the ITC as well as the PTC for both clean power generation and energy storage within his recent $2 trillion infrastructure plan 
   * Which ultimately implies  ENPH will see an assured growth in investment as well as production 
* Furthermore, this plan cuts electricity bills and carbon emissions related to power generation  

   * Which should in effect lower ENPH costs 
* Public Signaling via Biden’s view for Federal gov’t buildings
   * Biden mandating federal gov’t building to procure clean power for all of their supply needs 24/7
   * This necessitates energy storage and sets the best example for how the process is feasible and better for households/buildings and energy consumption  across the nation 
* Politically there is consensus that renewable energy is necessary and desired despite different reasons
   * Democrats prioritize curbing climate change, while Republicans are more motivated by reducing energy costs. Nevertheless, both are achieved via Biden’s vision and with ENPH integration
   * Increased consideration as a way to rebuild and stimulate the economy as well as increased necessity to strengthen infrastructure due to Covid collapse

**Thesis 3: Enphase’s Superior Technology**

Microinverters, release of the IQ 8, new battery storage technology

Enphase is overwhelmingly dominant in the space of microinverters and this approach easily beats out competitors in terms of technological superiority

* Three approaches: string inverters, string inverters with power optimizers, and Micro inverters 
* Micro inverters are technologically superior and current trends have already proven them to be the best solution:
   * Durability - only one to have a 25 year warranty
   * The technology is very scalable and upgrading is easy - this allows consumers to gain exposure to solar energy while not having to worry about being able to accurately assess their energy needs both now and in the future
      * Mass adoption of electric vehicles will precipitate a spike in consumers needing to install new solar panels
      * Pandemic proves energy consumption can be unpredictable
   * Safety concerns raised over home fires have pushed regulators in Australia and the US to favor micro inverters

The IQ 8 micro inverter is a game changer for off-grid solar systems

* Allows for homes to maintain some power in the event of a grid-wide shutdown
* Traditional off-grid solar systems that have batteries are expensive and reduce margin of profit substantially

Release of the Encharge battery storage systems

* Expansion of product offering brings greater diversification
* At full charge both battery and full PV capabilities are at your disposal
* Expansion of partnerships with different solar installers (Sunnova - one of the largest solar providers, Momentum Solar - an Inc. 500 fastest growing private company, Solar Optimum - targeting Southern California, etc.)

Expansion of digital offerings and tools via Sofdesk acquisition and acquisition of DIN’s Design Services Business will accelerate expansion of the Enphase Installer Network (EIN)

* In 2020, the EIN was expanded to Australia and, this month, it was expanded into Europe

**Conclusion:**

Enphase Energy is a strong growth investment opportunity within the solar PV space and is poised to offer substantial returns in the long run: 

1. Recent events in Texas and the continuation of natural disasters in other parts of the world open up a unique opportunity for battery storage to surge in popularity due to its independence from the grid and durability to continue providing electricity to homes in the case of disasters and grid failures
2. The current administration’s push for historic renewable energy investment bodes well for Enphase’s long term prospects - especially as Congress finally reaches consensus on the extension of the investment tax credit to battery storage technology
3. In addition, Enphase is poised to take an increasing piece of the pie as the pie continues to grow due to its superior technology and consistent evolution of its business

mvk5en,,StockMarket,post,1619024475,"There is one common denominator between the companies in this release from Bloomberg can you guess what it is? 😉There is a 5G company that currently has deals with AMZN (AWS), MSFT, VZ, GOOG, TMOB, T, DISH and Samsung just to name a few. Most of these deals were inked within the last 4 months. Obviously do your own DD and this is definitely not investment advice. One hint, the company was once the largest handset maker in the world and has completely changed their business model. The company is not revealed in the release so good luck but I’m thinking most of you know who it is already.... post is from Bloomberg.

Dish Network Corp. signed an agreement making Amazon.com Inc. a key partner in the development of its planned 5G network, advancing the company’s efforts to compete in the wireless business with incumbents like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.

Under the accord announced Wednesday, Dish will use Amazon’s cloud software and equipment to run core elements of the 5G network now under development. The company’s first 5G service will launch sometime in the third quarter using Amazon Web Services in Las Vegas, the first city in an eventual nationwide expansion. No financial terms were given.

The agreement is a crucial piece of Dish’s 5G strategy and comes nearly four years after Chairman Charlie Ergen said he was seeking a key partner that shared his vision of putting the company’s treasure trove of airwaves to use in a futuristic wireless network. Dish, a pay-TV provider with 11.3 million subscribers, is spending $10 billion to transform itself into a cloud-based wireless carrier to challenge giants like AT&T.

Shares of Dish rose as much as 4.4% to $39.61 Wednesday in New York, a 52-week high and their biggest intraday gain since December. New State Research called the deal “a ‘foot-in-the-door’ with a critical partner that provides strong validation of the opportunity ahead for Dish.”

Dish has the fourth-largest holding of wireless airwaves in the U.S., but almost none of it is in service yet. By using a so-called cloud-native network, Dish will be able to nimbly scale capacity up and down, depending on traffic, and deliver a range of applications, from heavy-data processing for businesses to simple texts to consumer phones.

Later Start

“We definitely share the same vision with AWS,” said Marc Rouanne, Dish’s chief network officer.

Dish is entering the 5G race behind T-Mobile US Inc., Verizon and AT&T, which already offer the service. But there are still very few 5G users, applications or revenue, suggesting the market remains wide open. Promoters of 5G services say they will enable innovations like immersive gaming and self-driving vehicles.

AWS will serve as the core of Dish’s network, allowing the upstart 5G provider to outsource its data operations in much the same way other businesses have turned to outside IT and cloud-services providers for data management. For Englewood, Colorado-based Dish, this means that mobile traffic picked up by a tower antenna will be immediately connected to the AWS cloud.

While AWS has tinkered in wireless, including a 5G edge-computing partnership with Verizon, this move with Dish is the first attempt to replicate core elements of a telecommunications network in the cloud.

AWS, the largest seller of cloud-computing services, has worked in recent years to make its products more valuable to customers in potentially lucrative fields like telecommunications, health care and defense. The division had $45.4 billion in revenue last year.

“A cloud partner like Amazon a gives us a low starting cost,” Rouanne said. Unlike the massive hardware and network-operation expenses of traditional carrier networks, “we will connect devices in a very cost-effective manner. This will make a big difference in the market.”","['AMZN', 'DISH', 'MSFT', 'VZ', 'TMUS']"

Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has  grew by 3% as one share is being traded for $5.44.

A lot has happened since the last outlook.

In the last outlook we've expected to the price of ZKIN to continue move higher, correct to the upside. As the gains were capped at $5.32, the price failed to attract selling pressure and waiting, sideways game has begun.

What happened after is called a long/shorts liquidation move, or a stop loss hunt for those who trade ZKIN.

Losses were capped at $4.87, so we may say we have a double bottom bullish pattern.

Luckily for the bulls the price has then returned to previous levels. The first try to break above $5.40 was unsuccessful and a bearish momentum has arrived.

The gains were then capped at $5.76 and we may speak about this move as a test of $5.80, a strong resistance.

As the price stands now, it's key to confirm previous resistance at $5.40 as a support.

The overall trend has changed into a strong uptrend.

RSI shows an uptrend, but bullish momentum is not active.

MACD is about to test a breakdown to a corrective, selling wave.

Overall we remain bullish and we look for a test to $5.80

As of writing this analysis, the price has tested $5.80 and a break above it will result in extended gains to $6, while break of $6 can lead to further gains to $6.50 area.",

But the Korean company, which now gets more than 95% of revenue domestically, wants to boost its international presence. To help with that, Naver is considering more dollar bond sales after its debut deal last month, and it’s also eyeing a possible future U.S. initial public offering for a unit, chief financial officer Park Sang-jin said in an interview. 

“To grow, it’s inevitable that we go global,” according to Park, who’s been with the firm since it was founded in 1999. “We should find business opportunities and meet capable partners to supplement our assets.”

Naver rival Coupang Inc.’s U.S. IPO last month was the biggest by a Korean firm in more than a decade. It underscored the drive by companies to expand globally, as well as investors’ willingness to provide funds for that. Naver has made investments overseas recently including taking stakes in Spain’s virtual marketplace Wallapop and Canada’s Wattpad. Park said the firm is looking for more opportunities in Japan, where its Line messaging service is popular, as well as Europe, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.

mvnmrn,,StockMarket,post,1619034037,"ELI5: Who can clarify my doubt on the REPO market?Hello everyone, I was reading about the REPO operations done by the Federal Reserve. From [here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements) you can see that in a REPO operation the FED *""purchases Treasury, agency debt, or agency mortgage-backed securities  (MBS) from a counterparty subject to an agreement to resell the  securities at a later date""*. From the FED point of view, this is a [Reverse REPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp) and therefore they should receive the interest on the cash lent.

From [here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details) you can see the details of the REPO operation. To enter in a REPO with the FED, the minimum Bid rate is the Interest On Excess Reserves (10 bp) + 5 bp. This to me makes sense, as if the rate was lower than the Interest On Excess Reserve, a counterparty could enter a REPO, pay the FED the REPO rate and invest the obtained cash at the Interest On Excess Reserves, getting free money.

However, [here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/bgcr) you can see the REPO rates. And it is just 0.01%! How is it possible? And if an institution enters in a REPO with the FED and pays 0.01%, couldn't they just exploit the arbitrage mentioned above?

Final doubt: in [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-repo-explainer-idUSKBN2C32AI) from Reuters, they say that since the REPO rate has gone negative a few times, investors prefer entering in a Reverse REPO at 0%. But why bothering doing the operation at all at 0% and not keep the money on the account?",

mvgibz,,StockMarket,post,1619014250,"ZoomD Q4 Results Technical Analysis**ZoomD (TSXV:ZOMD OTC:ZMDTF) is a cool martech/SaaS pennystock I’ve been holding onto for nearly a year at this point.**  Since I first bought ZOMD shares initially last May during the big COVID dip, its value has increased by some 70%, with similar growth metrics for ZMDTF (take a look at the chart below).  **After reviewing the company’s Q4/2020 financials, I’m confident that this is a stock to hold onto in expectation of significant growth potential.**

For those following innovative or disruptive martech tickers, here’s a bit of DD/financial analysis on ZoomD (see chart below).

Some key findings from yesterday’s press release:

* **YTD, ZOMD share price has increased a whopping 132%, with 185% growth over the past 6 months.**
* **ZoomD forecasts an increase in 2021 revenues by between 30% to 40%.**  This estimate is based on projections for a bullish “great re-opening,” expanded products and services, acquisitions, and the onboarding of new clients.
* **Gross profit margins increased by approximately 3.5% over 2020**, reaching a margin of 33% compared to 29% for the same period in 2019.  This increase has been attributed to the firm’s streamlining of operations, expense cutting, and redirecting focus to its most profitable customers.
* **The company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 million, with no deb**t (as of Year-End 2020).
* **SG&A expenses for Q4 2020 decreased by 6% relative to Q4 2019**.  This suggests the adoption of a more efficient and cost-saving internal business model.

This is NOT financial advice, but rather my personal analysis/DD.  I’d welcome comments or tip-offs for any other worthwhile mar/adtech stocks with solid financials and long-term growth projections.

So I have recently stumbled upon a dilemma while investing and wanted to ask if you sometimes face the same problem.

Let's say I want to invest in Apple because in general I know they are an innovative company with a strong competitive advantage and in terms of business would I perceive it as a good investment. However, as a customer, I don't like that they sell a product and an overpriced charger separately.

https://asiatimes.com/2021/04/chinas-digital-yuan-displaces-the-dollar/

For anyone who knows anything about finance, this article is nonsensical. Just two quick points then happy to elaborate.

1) A digital RMB is still the RMB; no one is going to want to use a currency that is not freely convertible. Can you imagine if you are from X country and got paid in digital RMB, only to find out that you cannot convert it to your home currency and take it out because of the existing currency controls in place? You will not want to accept that form of payment and instead demand that you be paid in your local currency, the USD, or another.

2) Where does the author suppose deposits will go? If I have digital currency, I will still put it into a digital bank that will create digital deposits. If the author is instead saying that the central bank will hold / warehouse all currency, then that’s the dumbest thing ever since that means banks will have no deposits and thus be able to make no loans. In that case, either the economy grinds to a halt or the central bank has to make commercial loans (no way they do that since the government is then opining who is creditworthy or not and has to get into the credit game).",
mvaove,gvbcysv,StockMarket,comment,1619007377,"Let start with basics first. What is money? Money is used for transactions instead of barter because two parties don't have any goods or services the other needs; hence money.

Governments issue money to facilitate transactions. With some countries there is a difference between the official exchange rate and the more realistic black market exchange rate. 

If digital currency is not accepted for transactions, then it is worthless. Has anyone tried to convert their digital money into government issued money? At the present time, not many businesses accept cryptocurrency for transactions because the exchange rate is so volatile. And then there is the question of which cryptocurrency to accept.

Personally, I am bearish on cryptocurrency. Companies like Coinbase or SOS that mine are like a printing company that prints money. Is it possible to print money like wallpaper so that the value goes down?",

The author is right to this one. CBDC are centralized, that means that the central banks has to control it, therefore it is required that your deposit account is in central bank, not a commercial one. That is the biggest issue central banks face. Both because by law it not allowed for individuals to hold accounts in central banks (therefore we must first have a legislation change) and because banks wont be able to give out loans in the traditional way. Thats why the pilot phase (at least for europe) is happening only for government trades. They will find a way around this drawback, but the author is right. You read the ECB CBDC whitepage for more.",
mv0bm9,,StockMarket,post,1618952524,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 20, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 20, 2021**

Stocks fell Tuesday, with all three major indexes dipping for the second straight session. Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  

Despite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it’s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, ""Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.""

In recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it’s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. 

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.
* Senior executives with Alphabet's Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel said on Monday.
* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The stock pulled back sharply
* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.

mun7ti,,StockMarket,post,1618913794,"[Mining stocks Thread] Set me straight. What stock are r/stockmarket mining bulls currently looking at?With the exponential  rise of EV’s, we are all aware of how high mining stocks have become bullish in recent years in the likes of $BHP, $VALE, $FCX and $RIO. But with the rise of these huge mining stocks, other mining stocks with small market cap can’t be overlooked.  
Over the past few years, I have managed to make some good gains with these so-called small mining stocks through growth catalysts. Up to date, this is what I’m bullish on:  
[$STHC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/sthc/) \- Southcorp Capital Inc

* Had a huge reverse merger with Ameca Mining/Group looming. Awaiting 43-101 report (delayed due to Covid travel restrictions) to validate findings in eastern Sri Lanka prior to finalizing reverse merger. $4.4 billion in high grade graphite being the biggest finding. Off take agreements already setup. Graphite demand exploding with EV battery market’s exponential growth. Ground level entry here under $30 million market cap.  


[$LODE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comstock-releases-shareholder-letter-embarks-104500170.html) \- Comstock Mining Inc

* Was a bit frustrated when Spruce Point tried to short them forcing me to sell 50% of my holdings but probably we’ll see the stock rise again with the revival of Green shift.

[$SLSSF](https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-reports-922m-of-0-point-94-percent-cueq-from-surface-in-continued-expansion-of-warintza-central) \- Solaris Resources Inc  
   This one is interesting;

* In order to expand its shareholders’ investment opportunities, $SLSSF has recently begun exploiting new mining fields, the latest being [Warintza ](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/)project in South-eastern Ecuador, thus making solaris an acquisition opportunity. 
* The reason why I’m bullish about this company is because I have been able to consistently gain from their stock since 2018 though, in the past 5 days it has dipped by a margin of 2.65%. 
* Moreover, this acquisition has significantly been de-risked by being fully funded and availability of drilling resources.
* Also, a report from the [geophysical](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) investigation shows that  the copper in the ground is worth four or five billion and the market cap is only 1 billion.
* It is $25 to $30 Rio Tinto or BHP stock on sale for $9.25 today. This asset simply can’t and won’t exist in a standalone entity, when this cycle is over

mv2qti,,StockMarket,post,1618959538,"Trying to better understand the bear case without everything getting oversimplified.TLDR: saying stonks only go up is as dumb as saying stocks have to go down just because they've been going up?

I swear when I look around reddit the only thing I see is either people trying to squeeze a stock, or people saying that everything is about to go bearish. I'm sorry but the mean reversion argument BY ITSELF seems incredibly dumb.

 In the last 5 months more money entered the stock market than the entire last 12 years combined. Why should long term averages be so heavily prioritized without evidence for any specific catalyst when the moving averages include a covid crash that estimated a pandemic lasting 2-5x what it's going to take us to get everyone vaccinated, probably more stimulus than anyone expected, and huge demand coming back much faster than analysts forecasted originally. Why isn't the current high valuations being looked at through the lens of we actually artifically suppressed stock prices during COVID and earnings rather than they truly deserve to be this low. Unemployment is only high because benefits have monstrously ballooned and people aren't going to go back to some shitty job that would probably pay less when the government is literally going to give them money to do whatever the fuck they want. 

The Fed absolutely has to keep rates low and they've said many times they will even if prices rise they're not going to change anything. They've already said they're going to focus on employment which will be very slow to change as previously mentioned and there's actually other reasons too but they've got more than enough justification to keep rates low and all the motivation in the world because markets represent everyone's retirements and no president is going to suffer people losing their retirement money on a rate hike its literally akin to reducing social security at this point. Inflation won't actually mean higher interest rates because the fed will keep them low forever.... 

Tax focus has so far been them mentioning a global minimum... so fucking what and yeah fucking right good luck. 

The US is like 1 and a half months from being at herd immunity and red states are already fully open and getting rid of mask mandates and it's big fucking nothing burger. 

Average savings are still historically much higher than normal in US as well last I saw or heard...

So stocks have to go down during a time when lots of industries have already corrected because some of the larger indices are so well averaged that they benefited from lockdowns and now they benefit as reopening gets more realistic. What gives with the bears I realize people feel things are overbought but they can literally remain over bought for entire 12 month periods.... I actually get ready to puke when people mention the buffet indicator as if it doesn't take just looking at stock videos on YouTube for a few minutes to get exposed to it. Stocks are forward looking into the future and there's been record amounts of money put towards propping them up Why is it such a given that they must drop without any actual negative events occurring. Just because they're hitting high on charts for like a month. I haven't seen anything about record levels of margin market wide maybe in a few meme areas but still. Maybe there is a lot more margin than I realize propping up the indices? Doesn't seem like it. 

Record stimulus, record low rates, high savings still, herd immunity being reached in 1st world countries, Unemployment certainly under no real dire threat of greatly rising. 

I'm not a permabull but I really can't understand the bear arguement just for the sake of it hit overbought for a week or a month. I actually feel like the only reason the more mid size companies not in the indices are doing poorly is just retail got super fucking bored and decided to start only throwing money at random squeezes instead of random stocks. Sure it hurt some companies but it's kind of done and over and it actually made a lot of valuations more reasonable. 


I would gladly go net short the market if I thought there was a reasonable upcoming catalyst to time but I look really far and wide wide don't see anything. Even the J&J blood clot issue looks like it's not going to have any real impact and real or not they're not going to let it hamper distribution apparently. Are there any legitimate catalysts to look for for the bears? Anything besides just stocks being above moving averages that are artificially low because the pandemic was priced to last 2.5-5 years instead of the 1-2 years that it's going to? 


Love you all no matter what plays you're into I get aggravated by some stuff sometimes but I really wish the various WSB/stocks/investing communities could get over the various differences in culture and priorities and just share information better because we really are better off when we all gather in the same place and can absorb the most arguments/information.",

That should have stopped you in your tracks. You have record high prices due to massive amounts of capital moving in to the market. Now what?

Where is the next wave of stock buying going to come from? More new money appearing from thin air? 

If you pay attention, the big banks have been unloading equities by the billions over the past few weeks leading into earnings. They know there is no more liquidity to come rushing in at this moment to extend the run. So they slowly unloaded on retail traders hoping for a big earnings run.

Once they shake out all the retail traders, they are sitting on billions to buy back in and profit off the next run.  It’s pretty simple really. You just made it complicated.",

Okay, cool, you’re open to there being a bear market. 

>but I really can’t understand the bear argument

Oh, okay, so not open to it. 

Well you’re set on your side and that’s okay, but you haven’t linked to anything from the Fed, any well-known economists or any outlooks. 

Most of your argument appears to be  based on what you’re seeing and feeling, but not on data. 

The Fed has to keep rates low or they ruin the market. That’s prop#1. 

>The last 5 months more money entered the stock market than the entire last 12 years combined. 

Oh, good, so you see that, too. 

>Why should long term averages be so heavily prioritized without evidence for any specific catalyst when the moving averages include a Covid crash that estimated a pandemic lasting 2-5x what it’s going to take us to get everyone vaccinated...

The same can be said for 2008, or 2000 or 1987. And yet they all followed the same average trend. Interesting, huh? 

You may ask yourself, “why is today’s high not next months low, and just repeat that forever?” 

One, people get worried. Stocks are risky. Once they make their millions on stocks, much of the money will be transferred into bonds, gold or other “boomer investments” that may now generate crazy returns but will be extremely stable. The bond market is much MUCH larger than the stock market. 

Imagine this happening many times over, at the same time, with people worth billions who have all made extreme amounts of money. They’ll sell their risky inflated stocks (which increases supply and drops stock price) and transfer to other instruments.

Two, there will always be a natural pullback. Why can’t it go up forever? It will go up in the long run as long as the company generates more revenues and stays relevant. But going up in the long run doesn’t mean there won’t be periodical pullbacks. 

The NYT wrote home refinances rose 42% in 2020, in a super hot housing market that people say there isn’t enough inventory for. The housing market will slow eventually, but the amount out on mortgages will still be considerably higher (hopefully not higher than the home’s valuation as was the case in 2008). 

When BlackRock’s chief investor is on major media outlets unafraid of telling everyone who will listen that there is too much liquidity in the market today, it should hold some weight.",['BLK']

mumhxi,gv6pjfl,StockMarket,comment,1618914009,"Couple years ago, when BTC had its first real surge  around xmas time reaching its first $20,000 mark.. BTC got its first taste of the mainstream media coverage. The fact the surge was actually due to a well coordinated pump n dump, it still served as a tide-like catalyst, wherein all the boats in that harbor rose with with it. There was some iced tea company that changed its company name to include Blockchain - while making zero changes or using anything related to  the block. Regardless, they got a solid 20%-30% bump to their price just by hijacking to the hype and swimming in the BITslipstream (for lack of a better term) 

Reason I’m mentioning that is - If the crypto stocks you bought into are legit and not just random fractional penny stocks hoping people buy shares because it has Blockchain or BIT in its name or ticker. If they’re sound mining operations or other legit crypto stocks, hold em. Because right now, there’s a catalyst for price surges happening almost every other month, if not faster. With the main difference being, this time - the surge due to manipulation. It’s all a byproduct of the slow (Although fast for their usual industry standards) adoption of BTC, ETH, NFT’s, and smart contracts by large financial institutions and market trend setters. 

Don’t be discouraged by red tickers or negative ROI just yet. Make sure you’ve chosen a solid company that is run well and has a positive outlook for their future growth mapped out and you believe it is attainable and reasonable. Past that, be patient and continue to monitor their growth, success - don’t concern yourself with the day,
Week, or even months prices. Crypto stocks are a long term investment generally. And if you’re hesitant on their sustainability once they do take off, sell some of your positions to recoup your original investment in them - keep the profits there and let them grow. Everyone’s system and goals are different. Just trying say don’t be discouraged, be patient, and trust that you’ve invested in a growth market that is primed to surge in the coming years.

SBUX went way down in March 2020 as we know. Those who bought at that time were smart, and those who sold...not so much. But let’s look into the future now. If you want growth potential, at what price would you guys buy SBUX at? At what price would you sell? 

I’d like to hear your thoughts. I’m not very knowledgeable about the plan, so I’ll have to make calls to Fidelity about it.",['SBUX']
mv42vv,gvacw83,StockMarket,comment,1618977574,"As a former Starbucks partner, I had the same questions you did. The 5% discount may not seem like much, but a discount is a discount. And, since it's taken directly from your check, you almost don't miss it (assuming you are not contributing a large percentage of your check). I didn't use this method to buy stock until I had already been with the company for a few years, but I wish I had started sooner.

The other thing I did was increase my contributions each year when I got a raise. I would keep a little bit of the raise for myself, but use the rest to add a percent or two to my contributions either for stock or my 401k. For example, if my raise was 3% (that used to be standard for most partners, though it may have changed now), I would increase my contributions for stock and my 401k by 1% each, and keep the last 1% for myself. Granted, I was a store manager working 40 hrs/week. Your financial situation might be different. But, even small contributions can add up quickly. Every 3 months, they will take your contributions and convert them to stock. I was usually able to buy 5 -6 shares or so each quarter (depending on the stock price at the time). Even with smaller contributions, you should be able to get a share or two. Again, not much, but it adds up.  For example, for my first distribution, the stock had recently split, and the shares I got were worth somewhere around $70. Obviously, they would be worth more now.

But, what was best about it for me was that after I left that job, I sold most of my Starbucks stock (for a decent profit), and I used that money to create a diversified portfolio with stocks of my own choosing. So, I was able to earn additional profit by investing in companies growing faster than Starbucks. Once the stocks are yours, you can do whatever you want with them. This seems to address your concerns about holding Starbucks stock long-term. Quite simply, if you don't think the stock will go up, sell it and buy something you like more. At least the Starbucks stock gets you into the market. Of course, you could just buy stock with cash, but this is where that 5% discount comes in handy.

You should also be getting free Starbucks stock grants once a year (each November, or at least it used to be), based on your position and how much you work.  They distribute this to your Fidelity account (the same place your purchased stocks will be, so set one up if you don't have one). Just make sure to accept the stock grants when they are offered. They take time to vest (1/2 in 1 year, the rest at 2 years), but once they vest, you can do with them whatever you want.

Also, don't forget to contribute to your 401k. Starbucks will match (it changes from year to year, but is between 4-6%). Again, it may not seem like much, but it adds up.

mupjoi,,StockMarket,post,1618922927,"Bank of America Initiates Coverage on $FSR ($31 PT), $GOEV ($6 PT) and $RIDE ($13 PT) (Bloomberg) -- 

U.S. electric-car startups Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Canoo initiated at BofA, as analyst John Murphy said that it is “without question that the advent of electric vehicles has arrived.”

* Said that while EVs will likely be on a slow penetration curve globally over the next decade, it would still translate into significant volume growth in absolute terms, from a low base
   * This is more of an opportunity for EV-centric automakers -- such as FSR, RIDE, GOEV)-- versus a risk (and opportunity) for traditional automakers, the analyst wrote in a note
* However, added that the competitive landscape among incumbents/entrants in the march toward electrification is becoming increasingly fierce, which is an under-appreciated risk for any EV maker
* Initiated FSR with buy, PT of $31, saying the company’s key competitive advantages are interesting product and its platform-sharing and contract-manufacturing agreements
* Initiated RIDE with neutral PT $13; sees RIDE’s underlying technology as less of a differentiating factor versus competitors, although its niche target market of trucks/vans/SUVs for fleet customers is logical
* Initiated GOEV with underperform, PT $6; noted that GOEV’s business model is increasingly in flux, with several significant pivots/changes just recently announced",['BAC']

On April 19, NIO co-founder and president Qin Lihong said during the 2021 Shanghai auto show that the company has already built its first marketing team in Europe, according to [Tencent News](https://new.qq.com/omn/20210420/20210420A021OW00.html).

Qing said NIO plans to hold a launch event in early May to introduce the company's European strategy.

He added that NIO is no stranger to the European market, having completed a global-based R&D layout in 2016, with branches in the UK and Germany.

NIO will build its first flagship showroom in Norway, and it now appears that it is expected to open in September this year, local media outlet Bilbransje24 quoted Marius Hayler, CEO of Nio Norway AS, as saying.""

mupj7d,,StockMarket,post,1618922881,"Fundamental Analysis of ZoomD’s 2020 Performance&#x200B;

As I’ve been reading through the 2020 year-end reporting/results for firms in my portfolio, I wanted to take the opportunity for a bit of due diligence on Zoomd ($ZOMD), one of my winning microcap/pennystock tickers.  (FYI: I’m not your financial advisor, just another ape, so don’t forget a grain of salt).

&#x200B;

Zoomd is an adtech mover-and-shaker whose services include a site search engine for publishers and a mobile app featuring their state-of-the-art user acquisition platform.  The  platform unifies more than 600 media sources into a single, integrated dashboard. Through this service, Zoomd saves advertisers  significant resources that would otherwise be spent consolidating data sources. Furthermore, Zoomd is a performance-based platform that allows advertisers to pinpoint marketing towards target audiences using a performance indicator-algorithm that is focused on achieving the advertisers' core goals and objectives. 

&#x200B;

Despite global economic disruptions, 2020 was a great year for Zoomd’s fundamentals.  They witnessed sizable geographic expansion by clinching deals with clients as far-afield as India, Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and Japan.  Over the course of the past year, the company also successfully closed a number of profitable mergers and acquisitions, most recently with Performance Revenues in February 2021.  They also announced the launch of a self-serving SaaS platform that is complemented with a white-labeled DSP (Demand Side Platform) programmable advertising service.  

&#x200B;

I came across this clip that expands on some of the agenda-items I mention above:

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8DVInA2NI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8DVInA2NI)

&#x200B;

Though ZOMD share price has witnessed periods of volatility, its glowing fundamentals earmarks these guys as a power-player on the rise.  I recommend potential investors and SaaS/marketing enthusiasts read through the Q4 results and do some further background research on these guys.",

A newbie here. I'm trying to figure out my strategy for the earning call at 6 pm EDT tonight. One thing I don't get is that looking back at how the stock reacted after the earnings call last year, it went down after Q1, Q2 and Q3. But it went up after Q4 earnings call.

Looking at the EPS, it looks like they missed it every quarter. So why did it go up after Q4 call? What did I miss?

Q1 2020 Missed by 0.08

Q2 2020 Missed by 0.22

Q3 2020 Missed by 0.20

Q4 2020 Missed by 0.20

Also, any strategies you can share with a newbie would be greatly appreciated :-)

Thanks!

mvb6hk,,StockMarket,post,1618993432,"SAFEMOON CRYPTO HELPI’m new to investing, I learned about safe moon. Wasn’t sure how to get it but I was highly interested in investing. I happened to meet someone else who also told me about it and told me how to get it. He told me to get TrustWallet and buy SmartChain, then swap it for SafeMoon. The problem is that it was not available every time I tried and he said to keep trying. So I did, I finally got through and bought $50 worth of smartchain on trust wallet. I’m already having two major issues. 

First, the Smart Chain isn’t showing up in my wallet. It still says my balance is zero on the app. This was about 30 minutes ago. I got an email saying it was approved and I should receive it instantly - I didn’t. Any help on this? 

Second issue. Assuming I get my SmartChain that I paid for (maybe it’ll take a day or so), how do I swap it for SafeMoon? My issue is that I went to transfer just to check to see how I could do it, and when I select I want to swap SmartChain that works fine. When I go to select what I want to swap it for, SafeMoon isn’t an option. The only option I get is BNB. Now he also mentioned pancake swaps. So I thought okay, I need to swap my SmartChain for pancake swap. That works out in my app it lets me do that. But then if I select pancake, it only lets me swap it for BNB again. No SafeMoon! On the main Wallet page (not the transfer page) I went to the full list of cryptos and selected SafeMoon so it would in fact appear on my main screen and I can see it. But it does not give me the option to swap for it!

#1 my purchase gave me nothing

#2 I see no option to swap anything for SafeMoon",

$10c @ $4.70 - $14.70 - 638% - 47.9%

$15c @ $3.00 - $18.00 - 833% - 27.1%

$20c @ $2.075 - $22.075 - 964% - 16.4%

$25c @ $1.50 - $26.50 - 1000% - 10.5%

$35c @ $0.975 - $35.975 - 412% - 5.3%

It needs to get above $52 for your strike to have been the better-paying returns compared to the $25c. The breakeven on the $25 is only a 212% increase from close, versus the $30 breakeven that needs a 250% increase. I don’t think the added risk to reward (especially since I think hitting $40 to begin with is ludicrous) is worth buying anything over a $15c. 833% gains versus 816% gains, and the lower the price from $40 at expiration the more disproportionate the 15c’s returns will be compared to the 30c’s.",

mvn91c,,wallstreetbets,post,1619032973,"VIAC bull thesishere is why i think VIAC (ViacomCBS) is one of the most undervalued, cash flow positive, high-growth potential stock that i've seen in a long time, generating the same revenue and net income as NFLX, but trading at 10x discount.

VIAC generates 40% of it's revenue from advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

VIAC is transforming their business into a streaming giant, with PlutoTV (43 million monthly active users) and Paramount+ (launched in March this year, 30 million CBS AllAccess subscribers were moved to Paramount+). VIAC acquired PlutoTV 2 years ago for 340 million (now worth billions already).

next earnings is on May 6 (first time Paramount+ user growth will be reported).

&#x200B;

[VIAC price back to pre-COVID levels](https://preview.redd.it/rtoepeqkiku61.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d0979e1292a4d9341a959348311196cea32d1c)

VIAC is back to pre-COVID price levels after it announced a $3bn equity raise for content production end of March and after millions of shares got dumped on the open market after Archegos  blew up.

[A: NFLX, B: VIAC](https://preview.redd.it/jjv6xuzvlku61.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=251a483a42aa4460ca81b0622c6591d5e3d6aa54)

VIAC annual revenue was $25.29bn (NFLX was $25bn), while VIAC net income was $2.31bn (NFLX was $2.67bn).

VIAC trades at 24.9bn market cap while NFLX trades at 244.6bn (that's correct, 10x more). NFLX posted pretty disappointing earnings yesterday, also mentioning slower user growth for 2021.

&#x200B;

VIAC domestic streaming rev outperforms ROKU total rev by over 40% (credit to [@AlanSoclof](https://twitter.com/AlanSoclof)) while VIAC trades at 24.9bn market cap and ROKU at 47.9bn.

VIAC owns Paramount, a  film production company that produces titles like Titanic, Mission Impossible, The Godfather, Star Trek, Top Gun, Spongebob, Transformers, you name it.

Paramount owns distribution rights for even more titles, including all recent Marvel universe movies (all Iron Mans, Thor, Avengers, Captain America, etc), Southpark, etc.

# Financials

VIAC lost $1bn rev in COVID 2020 year, but managed to maintain nearly equal operating income by executing strong cost cutting measures. provisions for income taxes cut deep into EPS YoY growth, nothing directly related to operational inefficiencies (good)

Theatrical rev decreased 67% YoY. once cinemas open again, rev likely to recover close to pre-COVID, adding $360M revenue.

VIAC boosted cash reserves by $2.3bn while only growing long-term debt by $1.7bn (good), deferred rev growing too (good)

Note: that's my own research and i'm long VIAC at avg 43. i'm not trying to pump VIAC, but would rather like someone to deconstruct my logic and find flaws.

Update:

mvgz0c,,wallstreetbets,post,1619015598,"The market is only giving blackberry a total valuation of 1.5 - 2 billion, ivy, qnx, spark everythingPatent sale could bring in any where from 1 to 2 billion, they already have 800 million cash

Let’s just say it’s 2 billion for now + 800 million 2.8 billion

BB market cap this morning was 4.6 billion

4.6 minus 2.8 billion cash on hand = 1.8 billion

They are giving blackberry the WHOLE company, with 68% ev market, spark security, Amazon partnership with ivy, qnx in 175 million vehicles, 700 - 900 million revenue per year a valuation of 1.8 billion

Let me say it again, the whole company for only 1.8 billion valuation (some people here say 3 billion when factoring in debt, either way it’s low)

After the covid crash last year BB market cap hit 1.7 billion, so after including potential cash on hand BB is trading at the same market cap today right now as it was at the bottom of covid crash


Edit: people in here talking about debt, blackberry has always had debt and is an ongoing part of their valuation, it doesn’t change the fact of what the valuation was 12 months ago to what it is now when you include the patent sale, they have less debt now than they use to and they are also going to have more cash than they use to. The market cap is still extremely low valuation to give the company after you factor in the cash they will have soon. From what I was able to find it seems debt was only 459 million in November

I have seen the FUD and 🌈🐻 Chads on the Roam.

Ignore all that fuzz and dig this DD.

None of the Fundamentals have changed since February and that the biggest thing.

I honestly believe they will continue on with the S2 Flight Schedule and head for the Moon.

Here are a few simple reasons

1. They want to begin sales in 2022 and the S3 won't be ready by then, the S3 really only has minor improvements anyways. One of them being turn around time. I personally think the S3 is not nearly as ready as people think it is ( hence the CGI interior, which may be why LAND ROVER is partnering with them for some Dope Comfy Interior's ), and it still needs a lot of work.
2. They already invested a ton of money into a working S2 Ship/Plane, they are going to want tomake their money back on that. They may even use both the S2 and S3 next year to maximizethe amount of Flights they can do. Building these planes isn't fast and each individual planeneeds rigorous testing.

They have put a ton of work into the S2 and the S3 has been around for awhile now they didn't build it over night. If they planned on canceling this May flight they wouldn't have said anything about flying at all. They aren't stupid even if we don't respect/like their decisions.

Could they use a better PR department and someone to handle their Social Media? Yes!

They just announced a partnership with Land Rover. ( Which I think isn't getting enough attention )

SpaceX would do the same thing, they would use their working models while they test on newer models and rotate them out when they are no longer efficient to use.

This is not financial advice I am a low tier tard with big dreams and smol memes.

mvknrs,,wallstreetbets,post,1619025874,"Why I am shorting GoPro (GPRO)Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of GoPro and have been since the release of the GoPro Hero 2. 

But although I like the product and the GoPro Hero 9 is my current go-to action camera, the stock price far overvalues the company. The stock saw around a 520% increase to the peak of recent prices from last March. What justified this increase in price? 

GoPro’s recent turn to selling subscriptions and their high 2020 subscriber counts was the good news for investors. They had a total of 760,000 subscribers by the end of 2020,  a 145% increase in subscriptions from the previous year.  Those who follow this company closely know that this increase in subscription price was due to the release of the GoPro Hero 9 and the promotion of $200 off a bundle package with the purchase of a GoPro subscription. Users know that the grammar of the subscription details was very sketchy and it was unclear if users could immediately cancel their subscription after purchase without being charged the $200 they saved because they didn’t hold their subscription for a whole year. Their subscription numbers hold just based on their GoPro Hero 9 release, few GoPro users turn to GoPro for accessories. Most GoPro users will go online where they can purchase an accessory mount from a different brand for more than 70% cheaper. GoPro’s strength in versatility has always relied on third party gear for custom mounts and specialized attachments. GoPro users who are looking to mod out their GoPro with a mic, ND filters, or stands, turn to companies such as Rode, Polar Pro, or other companies that are cheaper and higher quality than the modifications GoPro provides.

The company also turned to its Quik app to attract anyone who does video and photo editing/storing, not just GoPro users. GoPro has always been releasing apps but the apps themselves were finicky and never worth using from my experience. It will definitely be interesting to see the report on the success of the app when the company reports its earnings on May 6th.

As a GoPro user, as much as I like the company, I see that the product line is stagnant. GoPro releases one new camera a year (plus the MAX) and it’s users can barely justify the upgrade due to minimal change between models. Many youtubers and influencers commonly tell consumers to wait for the next model to upgrade since differences aren’t very significant. GoPro’s latest release was a pair of floating black sunglasses. They have tried multiple times in the past to get into lifestyle gear and it never caught on with their consumer base but they continue to release lifestyle gear, an indicator of how little the company is focusing on change. The moat of GoPro used to be HUGE but now, every other company has an action camera that is cheaper, similar in design, and often does more than what the GoPro offers (DJI, InstaOne, Garmin). 

The company is stuck on its GoPro Hero line and for the most part it is trapped. It tried to expand into making drones but DJI snuffed them out quick. It relies too much on third parties to provide accessories for the users that their accessories don’t make them enough revenue. Their software apps have always been substandard. GoPro is not a long term hold and I would argue they are not a short term one either. Earnings report on May 6th!","['DOW', 'GRMN']"

mv813r,,wallstreetbets,post,1618978549,"BB is the underdog, no question.**Ok, fellow Apes I admit.** I have been holding the blackberry bag since 20 bucks; but I am still faithful. I am faithful because blackberry is the underdog that wall street has casted aside (and given the fact that a loss is only a loss if you sale!) and berated BB as a profitless tech co. and has soured their legitimacy. It is deeply undervalued for reasons unbeknownst to anyone.

It is leading the tech industry in 5G in South [Asia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-will-power-baidu-technology-for-future-chinese-evs/); BB has partnerships with tech giants like Baidu--- securing a contract to run Baidu's mapping tech on their infrastructure for autonomous vehicles -- a partnership that will pay dividends as that market is only projected to grow in the future. I ask again why do Boomers hate BB? I don't fucking know.

Not to mention, BB has a very respected and competent CEO who in my opinion is being [overpaid](https://financialpost.com/investing/blackberry-ceo-chen-gets-128-million-award-to-continue-revival), but has the potential to bring the stock to 30.00 by the end of this year.  He has a proven track [record](https://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/blackberry-ceo-john-chen-turnaround-interview/).

oh, and by the way, BB is not a fucking smart phone company. At least not anymore. Maybe this is why they are not respected? That's a bullshit cop out; there's real money to be made with BB if we give it the proper evaluation. This [ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0ujm0/is_blackberry_bb_actually_undervalued/) was absolutely correct.  BB is a tech co. that develops secured communication systems, cyber security infrastructure, and works to secure these systems through AI.    It is deeply undervalued and is a underdog.

**Lets give BB a hand.**

Qualtrics is definitely NOT that type of company. So what do they do? They operate in a new SaaS (software as a service) category that uses AI and deep learning to bridge the experiences between business, employees, consumers and products. It’s a cloud platform that helps businesses grow, engage employees in a positive work culture, customers spend more and companies develop better products. Right? BORING.

Here’s what you need to know: they IPOd last year and are severely undervalued. Over 13,500 companies and organizations use XM, including more than 75% of the Fortune 100 companies. Q1 subscription revenue is up to $186M, up 46% YoY. And forward guidance is super juicy. Remaining performance obligations total $1.1B, which is up 77% YoY. If you don’t already know, performance obligations are contractual agreements to delivery services for revenue, a peek into future earnings. Fair value is $154.71 according to DCF modelling.

And BTW don’t confuse this ticker with Sirius XM Holdings LOLLLL

mvww2b,,wallstreetbets,post,1619064188,"Why $PTON is going to bounce back hardWith current events of negative light coming to Peloton due to operator negligence, their stocks have dropped significantly. I want to remind everyone why their stocks will not only soar back up to the $150 mark, but why it'll go even further than that. 

First off, as the pandemic hit and caused everyone to be forced to stay at home, the desire for residential fitness equipment skyrocketed. Even till today, residential and commercial customers are still having a hard time getting their hands on new dumbbells and strength equipment. Peloton monopolized hard on this pandemic not only by selling a shit ton of residential equipment such as spin bikes and treadmills, but by also requiring a pretty hefty subscription based service to use them. Something around $39 a month. 

Second off, during late last year they made the financial decision to buy out a MAJOR fitness company that has been making commercial treadmills, ellipticals, upright and recumbent bikes, and several different strength equipment for 40 years. Peloton bought out Precor, along with all of their factories. Gyms will still be buying Precor simply for the name. Most gyms once they have a brand they like, keep buying that same brand for everything. Precor will still be a heavily demanded product. 

Peloton now has their hands dipped into a massive chunk of the fitness market, both residential and commercial. And with their residential side also pulling in all those subscription based fees, they aren't short for money anywhere. 

As for the recent accidents involving Peloton treadmills, all treadmills are dangerous and can kill you. This isn't something unique to Peloton. I don't care if they have roller guards on them or not, there is not one single treadmill out there that will protect you, a child, a pet, or any item from being sucked underneath the belt. 

If you want to prevent unnessary injury or death, remove your safety key from the treadmill when not in use if you live with children. Fitness equipment are not toys. 

Peloton will bounce back from this, and when they do, they will still be neck deep in both the residential and the commercial markets.",

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000156459020042442/kcac-ex103\_63.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000156459020042442/kcac-ex103_63.htm)

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520326213/d53940ds1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520326213/d53940ds1a.htm)

The lock-up period for QS New holders (but not officers/directors) expires April 24th and the first market day after is Monday, April 26th.

The last lock up Expiration of the PIPE shares on Jan 4th led to a slide from $84.45 to $49.96 (\~40%)

In addition, QS has the Scorpion capital short report going against them.

It appears pretty damning overall, not that QS is a scam as Scorpion claims but that QS is certainly hiding issues with the technology (dendrite formation, the thickness of membrane, failing to disclose Columbus ratio, etc).

I don't want to go into personal feelings on shorts, but as a biochemist and student of battery tech; the complaints certainly have some merit.  
On the other hand, a company working on battery tech with BILLIONS of $ in potential earnings would certainly be secretive about some things, especially new solutions to old and expensive problems.

Market Cap 12.763B with no sellable product and their own timetable (heavily challenged by experts) is a claimed 4 years with experts weighing in at 8 years min and 10-12 likely.

History:  
Up 9% today  
Down 17% over 5 days  
Down 43% over 30 days  
Up 136% over 6M  
Up 239% over 1Y

Down 60% YTD

I purchased some puts (they are not cheap due to IV) 5/21 33p with plans to unload late next week as lock-up Expiry crashes the price. They were a slight discount today IMO due to the stock being up 9%.

I am not overly interested in the long-term prospects and my doesn't really consider the long-term technology value, just the lock expiry and the recent short report as well.

If the holders are 100% confident,, it wont go well.

If the current employees feel anything close to previous employees/Scorpion capital, it will pay quite nicely.

A 40% drop would put it at \~20$ and a 33p would print at over $900 profit (intrinsic+ value - premium).   


Probably unrealistic due to the deep-pocketed backers but even a 10% drop would put it at 29.70.   


Current prices o options are pricey due to IV and my breakeven is $28.59 on 5/21 (but I plan on dumping next week.

mvn13j,,wallstreetbets,post,1619032351,"Blackberry covered calls warning...be carefulBe careful with writing covered calls for blackberry. They(institutions and shorts) want you to write these covered call. Total short on stock is about 60 million or 10% of all shares. They realized that blackberry has a monopoly in connected and EV car operating system with Blackberry QNX and IVY, and they also have monopoly in Cybersecurity with Blackberry Spark for protecting critical iot devices (government computers and phones, drones, trafficlight, meter, all smart city infrastructure). This is a very critical monopoly that Blackberry will not admit to yet because Congress will then break them up. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in cybersecurity for IOT?  
If you look at all hacking that happened since December on government and enterprise(30,000 companies), none using Blackberry Spark were impacted!!! After Department of Commerce was hacked they immediately switched to Blackberry Spark. Same with Airforce and Canadian Government.  Crowdstrike will be a joke in coming years. Only blackberry has a zero trust architecture out of all cybersecurity company, and that's why they are able to protect governments from hacks like Solarwind and others can't do it. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in Car EV and Connected Cars?  
The Blackberry QNX software is THE ONLY car operating system authorized for connected cars. This is why every car company is signed up with Blackberry. Even Tesla's component coming from NVDIA uses Blackberry. The NVDIA controller used by Tesla for their autonomous driving is running on QNX. QNX is inherntly the most secure operating system in the world!!! The proof is in contracts from every car company to blackberry. The Rev will be about $50 per car in coming years. The Blackberry IVY will add about $10-$20 recurring revenue per car per year in coming years. 

&#x200B;

So why not write covered calls?  
The institution and hedge funds and shorts will trigger them soon. The Patent sale will be minimum of $15 billion for 25,000 patents. Patent is bread and butter of any company. Chen said ""most patents' that's why i'm thinking he's selling more than 20k patents. $15Billion automatically takes the price to $40!!!!!! overnight!!! you will lose your shares to hedge funds that're short and institutions.",['TSLA']

muvxgc,,wallstreetbets,post,1618940600,"George Floyd Play of the CenturyListen up retards, we have the absolute play of the century on our hands.

I've been playing very close attention to the George Floyd trial, and anyone with a brain can tell that this Chauvin guy is probably going to get off. Regardless of how you feel about that, there is an opportunity to make massive amounts of money.

Everyone here except maybe the 7+ million members who joined since June 2020 remembers the [massive protests that took place](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) when that event first went down. These protests largely started out peaceful, but many escalated into violence targeting local businesses. One of the most targeted businesses during these events was CVS (ticker $CVS). [CVS got his so hard they were forced to close some locations!!!](https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs-closes-some-stores-looting-protests-2020-6) Let's look at what happened to CVS stock over the same period of time:

&#x200B;

[See that Drop???](https://preview.redd.it/jr83oz706du61.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=a464465a4ed3279cac2c39dfd8063576aa82dcd6)

You guys see that drop??? CVS dropped 10% in a couple of weeks right when all this was going on! So what does this have to do with the trial??? By my estimations, the outcry from an acquittal will be roughly 10 times larger than what happened in June 2020. Doing some napkin math here, 10 times of 10% is 100%!!! Meaning if Chauvin is acquitted, CVS will be going all the way down to $0/share!!! The market is clearly not pricing this in, as CVS is currently trading at about $76/share, $76 more than it is actually worth.

With a verdict expected by the end of May, there is still time to get in on this once in a lifetime trade!!! I only wish I had enough capital to make (almost) unlimited gains on this play.

Edit: Positions. Short $10k shares of $CVS

mv8zg3,,wallstreetbets,post,1618982793,"Nintendo - underrated Value? (sorry for bad English, I'm from Germany)In this post, I want to discuss the hidden values of Nintendo.

1. We start with a short fundamental analysis

\-Nintendo has liabilities of round about 32,5$ per share

\-on the other hand there are 119,5$ equity

that means we have 87$ assets per share (we can subtract this amount for the further analysis, because this value is available in assets)

one share cost round about 580$ - 87$(in assets) we get a price of 493$

If we use the predicted earnings for next year, we've got a PE-ratio of 15,5.

That's a normal PE-ratio for a Japanese Share, but what are the hidden values of Nintendo (in my opinion)?

As many of us, I was watching YouTube Videos in the Corona-Time. And I got addicted to Pokemon Booster openings. In this context I realized, that my generation, has a big emotional bond to Nintendo products. Nintendo still hold's the license for popular franchises like Pokemon and Mario Kart. The amounts of money, that flew, just for very old products of this franchise, give u a roughly estimate, of how big, the value actually is.

The Switch has been on a hot streak but they've massively slowed down on major releases. You'll certainly see an uptick when BotW2 releases but unfortunately they're a rather stubborn and traditional in their approach to video games. I'd jump on Sony tbh because of the chip shortages, PS5 being difficult to obtain and they seem to be only getting warmed up.

They settled most of the glyphosate cases now and are working on a solution for future cases. There will be a judge’s decision revealed on 12 th May. If the judge acknowledges the two billion additional payment on top of the 10 billion they already spent for the settlements. This stock will rally back because it trades lower than at times when analysts estimated costs up to 40 billion dollars. In reality it is much cheaper now. And here comes the next catalyst: Bayer produces the Curevac vaccines. So this will be Bayer/Curevac. Also they are in genomics and bought a lot of crispr tech companies. These companies alone could get a higher valuation alone if listed than the whole big giant Bayer is trading right now. I’m bullish and confident the company will manage a turnaround story.,

muyk1w,,wallstreetbets,post,1618947682,"Short Sellers Never Learn - They're Doubling Down on CLOV (DD)At this point, seems a lot of people know about CLOV. Just so happens that the catalyst was a data error, but the opportunity is still quite strong even though the short interest isn't 144% of float. After all, it's now estimated at over 43%, making CLOV still one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market (if not THE most shorted stock).

Now, I actually bought into this at $7 several weeks ago. I first became aware of CLOV in the midst of the January hype, but I don't like buying high, so I stayed away. Came back a few weeks later and started watching for bullish signs as it dropped, saw that sweeeet solid bounce happening after tapping $6.50, and bought in around $7 myself.

https://preview.redd.it/5v5jbsepycu61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=8804c928fbb1e9bcff4269a4808a906c2ff376bb

A few reasons for this initial bullishness from that point:

* I think the ""DOJ Investigation"" accusations are a bunch of hogwash and were causing a temporary and factually empty hammering of the stock.
* The average price target among analysts was at something like $13.50 at the time, with no analysts labeling it a sell. That is super promising for long-term holds.
* The market opportunity itself. CLOV is one of those ""will make it big or will die trying"" kind of stocks. I think they can make it in the space, but it's uncertain enough to give fuel to detractors, keeping the price down until their results start showing.
* The continued support shown around $7 weeks later just confirmed my bias, so I was watching closely to add to my position at the first sign of bullishness.

https://preview.redd.it/ebpjsdb00du61.png?width=198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f114a359f0333b9f693cdcffefe1aee139e748d1

Needless to say, seemed like a home run, a nice value opportunity for a long-term hold. Then, I became aware of the short interest.

Friday I saw my position exploding and had to look into why. Saw the 144% short interest report and increased my position by like 10x. This was no longer just a buy and hold for a high long-term gain, but could really explode up quickly! Turns out, the short interest wasn't quite accurate. But, ironically, this inaccurate short interest report actually did result from CLOV going from a top 10 short interest stock to quite possibly THE most shorted stock on the market in terms of float. Here's where it stands now according to Ortex. 

https://preview.redd.it/g7oobj1tqdu61.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa2960f93772aaee400260dc35a6fcd12df4da54

With a 90% util rate, just about every share even available to be lent for shorts is taken up at this point. Shorts have basically maxed out their position, making up about 43% of the technical float. 

However, a large portion of the float is not actually ""available"". Given the information available on their most recent 10-K, it appears that roughly 87 million shares are owned by insiders/controlling investors. This leaves less than 60 million shares actually available for the ""real"" available float. This is likely why the util rate is at 90% despite less than half of the shares being on loan. We're at an ""effective"" short interest of roughly 75% and rising.

Y'all, I liked this stock before this whole thing, but now I love it. This is a pretty unique opportunity to squeeze some shorts. I don't want to say it's the ""next GME"", because obviously GME actually was shorted all the way past 100% of float and was a turnaround story itself. GME also took a super long time to actually take off and make that squeeze happen. I was in GME in Feb and March of 2020 and actually had sadly taken out my money when the stock hit like $24 in Dec (I never imagined it might go into the $40s, much less $400+).

I don't see this as a ""turnaround story"" so much as a stock that has been massively underestimated by the market due to some hammering of Chamath and general SPAC distaste. For me, this is a value play that's been enhanced by the potential for a pretty massive short squeeze.

Full disclosure, I currently hold:

* 300 shares
* One 21 May 7.5 C
* One 18 Jun 7 C
* One 20 Aug 12.5 C

I'm also waiting on a deposit to clear, with which I plan to purchase a LEAP. I may roll my May call into something with a later expiry as well given how hard it can be to time these things.

P.S. To top it all off, I'm a giant fan of the Wyckoff Method. The daily chart looks like a great Wyckoff setup right now, with today's pullback to the neckline area providing a promising potential LPS.",

mun1ng,,wallstreetbets,post,1618913033,"#BlackBerry DD 🚀Time to put some news on the table about one of the most undervalued stocks. It still blows my mind why wall street hates this company.
We know the boomers are retarded, but you literally cannot be that much retarded to undervalue this goddam stock. But enough with chit chat. I am talking about our favourite fruit #BB.
 
Just to put it into perspective… Blackberry has a market capitalisation of 5.12B and a total valuation of around 6B. Total turnover was around 890 million.
Just for comparison cloudflare inc. has a total market cap. Of 23B with a total valuation of 21B while having a total turnover of approx. 430 million. I know this isn’t the best comparison, I just thought it would be interesting.
https://de.wallmine.com/nyse/bb
https://de.wallmine.com/nyse/net
 
This company has transformed itself from a lost hero that made phones to one of the best, if not the best company making security software, yes. Security software, not only cyber security software.
 
Currently BB makes several interesting products.
QNX
QNX Hypervisor
Spark
IVY
AtHoc
And they even make a new phone (manufactured by OnwardMobility)
Information about the phone currently is kinda scarce but still interesting
https://en.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/blackberry-5g-smartphone-2021/
 
As you can see there is plenty of interesting stuff going on…
 
There are plenty of DDs posted on WSB for BlackBerry already and I would only tell the same news again so here is the link for the best one if you want to know more about their products.
Thanks to u/_MoveSwiftly for that great post.
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/
 
So what has changed since the DD I posted above?
 
BlackBerry released their earnings, which led to a big dip, that keeps dipping. Reasons for the dip? Honestly I don’t get it. There are literally only positive news for the future. But the boomers don’t care, they are probably still salty their favourite phone company from the good old days is gone and they don’t like the new touch tech.
 
Now the good… And there is plenty good.

mv43dh,,wallstreetbets,post,1618963907,"$VIAC Bananas 🍌🍌🍌**TL;DR**. 

*Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at* **$37.83.**  
*And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at* **$65.26.**.   
*And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping* **$86.23**   

**VIAC offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of a current market in-efficiency.**   
As we all know by now a series of events lead to Archegos getting margin called. The Archegos fund was extremely aggressive and was operating under 5x leverage, heavily concentrating on Chinese and Media Stocks, such as BAIDU, BILI, TCEHY, IQ, VIAC, DISCA. There are many articles that explain how this margin call came to be. I won’t be discussing it here, because I want to discuss the opportunity this presents.

Whether you think Paramount + is good or not. I still think there is still an opportunity to cash in on VIAC’s assets. VIAC has a strong balance sheet and many assets that are valuable in the content business regardless if Paramount + takes off or not. Let’s address the elephants in the room. Can Paramount + compete with the top players like NFLX, DIS, or even HBO MAX?
I don’t think it matters if they can successfully compete or not because they have a huge library of content they can sell licences on and this makes them a valuable target to be acquired by the likes of AAPL or AMZN who are trying to pave their way into the streaming business. Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I’m sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they’re extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.

**The Valuation:**

I will present you with 3 different valuation all of them assume Paramount + is a flop and does not take off so I assume zero growth on their streaming service.   

Scenario one: Bullcase, I assume they will grow their total revenue by 3-5% for the next 5 year.  
[Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/78x276u).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/s6TOmhj)

Scenario two: Bearcase, I assume their total revenue will be shrinking by  (-) 7-3%.  
[Revenue Calculations](https://imgur.com/JUWIXuz).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/gra7R5E).  

Scenario three: I used an old school valuation method to value the business, Earning Power Value (EPV). In the EPV method it takes away the requirement for trying to predict the future and only takes into account the present business earning power. This method of valuation assumes no growth to the business. This method of valuation is a good valuation metric for valuing mature non growing businesses.   
[EPV Valuation](https://imgur.com/un2fh7u)

**Conclusion:**

Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at **$37.83**.  
And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at **$65.26**.  
And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping **$86.23**.
