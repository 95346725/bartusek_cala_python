Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Don’t listen to the big media platforms too much!So lately the market has been going down and people might have gotten some bloody days in their portfolios. The correction has affected tech the most as the Nasdaq is about 8% from its all time highs.

The correction has happened because of number one: Rising treasury yields and number two: Sector rotation. Reopening plays are currently the trend that big money likes and money has gone there recently. 

This doesn’t mean that tech is bad in the long term. Stocks go down sometimes and this is the moment that it’s happening. But there is a silver lining to this story...

This gives us a good opportunity get your favourite stocks at a cheaper price. Averaging down is a very delightful thing to do and this is a perfect opportunity. And even if we continue to go down, it’s ok, since you can average down even more.

Another thing that I want to say is that you shouldn’t listen to the media too much. It’s their job to create havoc and drama in the stock market. Their opinions change every week almost, and it’s kinda funny sometimes. One week they say that you shouldn’t sell and another day CNBC reporters tell us how big tech is in a bad place and you should move to industrials, travel, etc. 

You have YOUR own plan. Do your plan and don’t listen to those whose job is to dramatize things. The stock market needs patience. Investing is for the long run.

Don’t look at the 1 day chart all the time. It can be very toxic for yourself, especially during a red day. So just chill and remember that your time horizon is in 10 years, not tomorrow.

That’s my 2 cents, have good one everyone!",['NDAQ']

mdorgy,,stocks,post,1616765668,"Remember, it doesn't matter how much a stock goes up, what matters is how much more it goes up than the indexI've seen a lot of comments along the lines of ""tech stocks are down, but they'll go back up, there's no reason not to buy them"" but that line of thinking is flawed. Of course tech stocks will go back up, but what's important to your returns is if you think they will rise faster than whatever index you choose to compare them too. Because if they don't, you could have just bought that index fund, had less risk, less work, and better returns. You should always be thinking about your stock purchases in the context of ""Do I think this will beat the index?"" *not* ""Do I think this will go up in the future?""

Edit: this post is not to advocate for index funds, it is to educate about how to measure stocks returns. This is stocks 101,  how well a stock has performed is measured in reference to an index, the difference in returns between the two is called Alpha. Honestly if this concept is new to you then you need to do a lot more research before you try to start picking stocks.",
mdorgy,gsaqov4,stocks,comment,1616770734,"This is so important to keep in mind. And I totally get what you mean when you say you’re not necessarily advocating for indexing, but are rather just reminding people of how to benchmark and analyze their gains. It’s really just opportunity cost, which far too often is unmentioned and unrecognized on here. The idea of “I never need to sell because eventually it’ll go back up” is in general wise because it keeps people from actively trading, which research shows decreases performance in the long-term, but it’s an unfortunate adage because if it takes your equities a year to bounce back, you did not necessarily benefit from keeping them, in the same way that you didn’t make the right choice to hold something that bounced back 10% when the NASDAQ is up 20%, for example. It’s also tied in with people somehow thinking a stock is inherently more likely to go up 10% if it’s recently dipped, when in reality, the likelihood that a stock that just dipped from $40 to $30 goes back to $40 is the same as the likelihood that the stock goes from $40 to $53. Both are 33% increases. 

Basically — the fact that your favorite stock dipped 20-30% does *not* mean it’s much more likely to go back up 20-40%. The market is pricing in a *lot* more information, and billions more dollars, than the average investor, and if it were as simple as “a stock that dipped is super likely to go back up even quicker than another one”, then hedge funds would just adopt that ridiculously simple strategy: investing in hot momentum stocks when they dip 25%, then selling when they “quickly recover” for a 25-35% gain. It can’t be that simple. We just want it to be because we hate realizing that yes, getting back to where you used to be after your stocks dip 25-30% means you need to make a 30-35% return.",['NDAQ']

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street’s institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don’t have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

“Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn’t have before,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. “It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.

 SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It’s common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don’t typically offer them to the everyday investor.

mdfswd,,stocks,post,1616729630,"$HGEN - short term COVID play with Phase 3 data release by end of march and 5-10x possible ROIHumanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”…  “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”

Here’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success
4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]:  “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID – getting worse**

As many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx). Humanigen in collaboration with BARDA to increase manufacturing capacity
2. License agreement with KPM Tech/Telcon RF Pharamceutical company for Lenzilumab production in South Korea and the Phillipines. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005167/en/Humanigen-Executes-Licensing-Agreement-for-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-in-COVID-19-with-KPM-TechTelcon-RF-Pharmaceutical-for-South-Korea-and-the-Philippines)\]
3. Partnership with Thermo Fisher to scale up manufacturing. \[[Source](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/humanigen-thermo-fisher-reach-agreement-to-scale-up-manufacturing-monoclonal-antibody)\]
4. Partnership with Emergent Biosolutions for development and manufacturing. \[[Source](https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humanigen-and-emergent-biosolutions-announce-contract-0)\]
5. Partnership w/ Avid Bioservices for manufacturing agreement. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210203005204/en/Humanigen-and-Avid-Bioservices-Enter-Into-cGMP-Manufacturing-Agreement-for-COVID-19-Therapeutic-Candidate-Lenzilumab-in-Support-of-Potential-EUA-Filing)\]
6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

**Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well. 

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

My ex wanted us to buy a house. I was hesitant. Wasn't sure if I was ready. And I was always per-occupied with stock trading and investing. She started cheating and left me for another man.

Anyone else have similar stories of your SO getting disgruntled because you were addicted to stocks/investing? 

Sometimes I miss being in a relationship. But at the same time, I'm scared of getting involved with somebody else because I'm being cheap and don't want to kill my financial future. Buying a house, having kids, would basically have me live day-to-day which I am not used to.  (I only make 45k a year)",
mdp8k9,gsaq5el,stocks,comment,1616770494,"You could legit get taken out by a bus at 34 bro. Start enjoying your life. Have fun. My dad got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer at 58. My wifes grandmother died of cancer at 57, three teammates from my high school football team are Already dead before they made it to 30. Anything can happen any day. You've got a baller start, You've got to learn to balance life and retirement. You can choose to be a bachelor and not have kids so you can retire young...But that life sounds super sad to me.   


This is going to sound mean. So I appologize ahead of time and if you are someone who is overly sensitive to criticism and advice I might just not bother reading it.   


You have no savings/cash but you've got 150k in your retirement? Where the fuck is your emergency fund? 6 months minimum. Still living with mom and dad keeps your costs down but you're eating theirs. Get out of your damn parents house, you're being selfish. Here's how I would play it if I were you, Before you change your life and start enjoying being alive.  


step 1: Half your contributions. Maybe even only invest a quarter of what you are currently putting into the market.  


Step 2: Save up 5-6k, out of what you would have contributed to the market. Make that your current emergency fund. (Just incase medical expenses, car expenses, You don't have to have a ton because you don't have adult problems right now you're still living like a kid)  


Step 3: What's the cost for a house in the area you want to live? Step 3 is probably make more money running side hustles while you have free time by not having a wife and kid and save up 20% of a downpayment on some type of house, even if all you can afford is a condo you need to get out of mummy and daddy's house. if you live in an area where 44k is chump change You need more money or to find a significant other and team up on investing on buying a house. If you live where 44k is plenty of money then I would still do the side hustles to speed up the process at which you can save 20% so you get out of mom and dads house sooner, because you're a grown ass man with 150k invested living with mom and dad. I can't stress that enough. You could have bought most of a house in a shitty state by now instead of invest.   


Step 4: If you want to stay the bachelor life and all that find a nice small pad to live in and buy that once you have the money saved up. Get one that isn't going to make you house poor. 25% of your net income. This is why if you're making shit money a significant other could be financially beneficial. Because one person making shit money probably can't buy a house. two people making shit money can buy a house. You would team up on an ""investment"" that you currently can't afford. If you live in an area with a high cost of living this step might be where you consider moving to a cheaper area.   


Step 5 increase retirement contributions to a respectable affordable amount that still give you enough money to go do stuff and have fun.   


Step 6 go live your life. Investing is supposed to help you turn your money into more money with minimal effort, with the effort it sounds like you are putting into investing you could have made way more than you did by just getting a second job and investing twice as much in VOO. You aren't an investor if you are letting it ruin your life. You're a gambling addict. Go get help.",

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-friday-march-26.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

> * Dow and S&P 500 futures Friday added to Thursday’s late-session comeback, which saw Wall Street break a two-day losing streak, putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 at about breakeven for the week. The Dow closed up 199 points, boosted by economic comeback stocks, after losing as much as 348 points earlier Thursday. Nasdaq futures turned lower Friday after the index closed slightly higher. However, it remained 1.8% lower for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up Friday but still below recent 14-month highs.

> * The Commerce Department is out with personal income and spending figures for February at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect an income drop of 7%. Spending is also seen dropping by 0.8%. In January, income jumped 10%, its biggest monthly gain since April, as Americans received stimulus checks approved in December. Spending in January increased by 2.4%. In the coming months, another round of stimulus checks, approved in March, could start showing up in the data.

*****

> # 2. Office-sharing company WeWork signs new deal to go public

> * WeWork, which pulled its IPO in 2019 after a dwindling valuation and resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann, has reached a new deal to go public. The office-sharing company agreed on Friday to merge with special purpose acquisition company BowX Acquisition Corp. The transaction values WeWork at $9 billion, a fraction of its one-time valuation of around $47 billion. Following the announcement, shares of BowX rose 2.5% in Friday premarket.

*****

> # 3. GameStop shares to open higher after soaring over 50%

> * GameStop shares jumped roughly 10% in Friday’s premarket, the morning after snapping a five-session losing streak and closing 52% higher. There was no apparent news Thursday. GameStop has been the most high-profile “meme stock,” popular among retail traders on Reddit and other social media platforms. The stock lost about a third of its value Wednesday after the video game retailer delivered disappointing fourth-quarter results, failed to give in-depth detail about its digital turnaround plans, and acknowledged it’s considering selling more stock.

*****

> # 4. Tesla ordered to have Elon Musk delete anti-union tweet

> * The National Labor Relations Board told Tesla to make Elon Musk delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers within the company. The independent federal agency also ordered Tesla to reinstate a fired employee, Richard Ortiz, a union advocate. Tesla must also compensate Ortiz for loss of earnings, benefits and adverse tax consequences that resulted from his termination. The NLRB decision was largely in line with an administrative law judge’s ruling from 2019, which Tesla had appealed to the full board.

*****

> # 5. Suez Canal blockage delays estimated $400 million an hour in goods

> * The Ever Given, a stranded mega container ship in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million per hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that move through the key waterway every day. That’s according to shipping data and news company Lloyd’s List. Lloyd’s values the canal’s westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world.

They're barrowing the stock.  Thus, at some point, they're going to need to return them.  If not, they pay interest, but just like with a credit card, they'll garnish wages if you don't pay up at somepoint.

How long can one theoretically go without covering?  Let alone tacking on more?",

md6n7q,gs8ac3g,stocks,comment,1616713406,"Borrowing assets to sell makes the world go round.

If you borrow money for the purposes of spending it, you have shorted that asset in some sense.  You have short sold cash (in a very small, almost totally insignificant way).  You carry that balance as long as you want to keep paying interest on it or until your lender calls it back in.

You buy a house?  Well, you're short cash and long real estate.",
md6n7q,gs8jpdr,stocks,comment,1616718128,"There needs to be a catalyst in order to make them cover their positions. Some catalyst’s:
- Gamma Squeeze 
- High Borrow Fee
- Margin Call from DTC
- Share call back and reverse split
- Failure to deliver Squeeze",
md6n7q,gs8bb90,stocks,comment,1616713897,"Until their equity is overshadowed by their debt. That's what normally triggers a margin call. The new DTCC rules should help, if they enforce it. However, I think that's unlikely. IMO, the more plausible scenario is they cover a little at a time and drive it back down, repeatedly, to get the best price. 

The million dollar question is how many synthetic shares and FTDs are in play? In the case of GME and AMC, Melvin Capital underestimated retail traders, and doubled down on the naked shorting. If either, or both, squeeze, they're destroyed. So who is left with the remaining balance, after they fold? Citadel, and any other MMs that participated and backed Melvin. 

I think most people are looking at this whole thing the wrong way. It's not retail traders vs. hedge funds. There is no loyalty amongst thieves. What we're seeing is war among the upper ranks of institutional investors. They're betting huge against each other. Look at the institutional holdings of each stock and how they've changed over the last couple quarters, especially Fidelity, BlackRock, and Vanguard. All three participated heavily in the initial momentum of WSB, and currently hold huge positions in both. 

Robinhood, Webull, and TDA all stopped buy orders (to varying degrees), but not sell orders. Fidelity did not. Why? First, Fidelity is so enormous that it's its own MM. This is a large reason they didn't halt, because they didn't want to wreck the market they've created. Second, Fidelity was holding a large stake for themselves, not to mention other institutional/accredited investors. Third, the other three ""brokerages"" never really possess your shares. They make money by scalping the orders, acting as dropshippers for investments. They're middle-man organizations that do the paperwork for larger and/or parent MMs/broker-dealers, skimming small profits off each order. This is why you usually make a little less or lose a little more trading with these ""brokerages."" Additionally, they sell your data to institutional investors that are willing to pay for an advantage. Free trades aren't free.

I don't comment much in this sub, but I watch a lot. There have been a ton of posts lately where people are losing faith in the market and beginning to panic. This war of elite investment houses is what's causing the red fallout in the broader market. A lot of people like to laugh off WSB (the same people scoffed at Amazon, Tesla and Bitcoin, also), I did too, but this is moving the entire market, not just meme stocks. Thankfully, I had the foresight about a month ago, to sell all my holdings and go all in on AMC. I saw it as a defensive hedge, and I should have done it sooner. Sometimes it costs less to go with the flow, rather than erode your principal trying to fight the tide. 

If the squeeze potential is real, these HFs will have to sell their profitable positions and find new short-term shorts. They've been doing that for a month and a half. This is what caused the market volatility, not WSB kids buying and holding. If it squeezes, to the anticipated levels, me and my entire family can retire. If not, there's no reason AMC can't return to the $20-$30 range. I'll take that double or triple over some of the ridiculous losses people have been taking in other stocks, lately.","['TSLA', 'AMZN', 'BLK']"
mdn2uy,,stocks,post,1616760193,"NIO and XPEV are oversold, will have a very strong bounce - BUY THE DIP! These stocks are getting hammered because of 2 reasons - semiconductor shortage and Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act

1. semiconductor shortage is temporary and is a non-issue. It will go away in a week or two
2. HFCAA - the main thing this law does is to prevent companies being listed that are associated with Chinese military. And even then, companies have 3 years (!) to comply and can only be delisted after 3 years of non-compliance. Neither NIO nor XPEV has anymore connections to military than Tesla. And you can be sure that if these companies are pressured to delist, China is gonna respond with banning Tesla from China, and thats never going to happen!

mdcpjo,,stocks,post,1616719211,"PSA: It's okay to sell at a lossLately there has been a lot of ""diamond hand"" mentality out there, and not just with meme stocks. It seems to be a general sentiment about the market as a whole, that we must buy the dip and hold through it. This is a good strategy for your long positions that you are planning on holding for 10+ years, but most people have at least a few positions that are not long-term 'ride-or-die' equities. And yes, there are times when it's fine to sell the dip as well.

The prevailing argument is that, if only everyone would stop selling, the market wouldn't crash. But this is the prisoner's dilemma. The fact is, people will sell. No matter how bonded you feel to your cohorts on Reddit, they will turn against you and sell as soon as they see enough commas in their portfolio. (Or enough blood)

If you are holding shares of some company, and you believe the price of those shares will continue to drop, then what's stopping you from selling? Is it fear that you'll sell at the absolute bottom and miss out on gains? Isn't it just as possible that you'll sell right before an even bigger dip, and be able to buy back in at an even lower cost basis? Both choices are worth considering. It is not rational to simply dismiss the option of selling as inherently bad.

Bottom line: It's OK to buy high and sell higher. It's also OK to sell low and buy lower. Stop trying to get the perfect timing, because you never will. If you're watching your net worth drop to unrecoverable levels, it's time to think about selling. Don't fall in love with your positions. It's a lonely hill to die on.

EDIT: I'm not a financial advisor, but if you're looking to rotate into less risky investments as a hedge, I would recommend learning about SPACs. Most of them are trading at their rock bottom right now, which means you are pretty much guaranteed not to lose money if you know what you're doing. Used correctly, they can be like savings accounts with infinite upside potential. Selling at a loss can suck, but it sucks less when you're putting that money it to something that won't make you poor and might still make you rich. Just my two cents.",['PSA']

md828q,,stocks,post,1616705371,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 25, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 25, 2021**

Stocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet another volatile trading session. Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. 

In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency."" This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. 

However, despite Powell’s consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, “This will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it’ll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they’re most needed.” 

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

We agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, [insisting the vaccine was “strongly effective” against the virus. ](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d)

mdlh1s,,stocks,post,1616753717,"Portfolio discussionHey guys! Been lurking here for a few months and thought I might get my feet wet with a post. I’ve been investing since January and have been through meme stock FOMO, penny stock mishaps, and now a down market. All that aside  and although it’s only been a few months, I’m having a good time learning and feel as if I’m developing a pretty solid foundation thanks to time spent on here (and other resources of course.) Thanks to all of you! 

Thought it might be fun to share my portfolio and open it up to any sort of discussion. A lot of these were admittedly bought based on recommendations from my coworker when I first started out. I would tell him some sectors I’m interested in and he would give me companies he would buy if it were him. Now that I’m learning more about the market and my own personal style, I’m reassessing these positions and deciding which to keep and which to sell. I definitely realize that I am not diversified at all. There are also two stocks that I can’t post about due to sub rules. 

AMC - 42 @ $16.64 (-34.27%) I started investing a few weeks prior to all the meme stock hype and naturally got swept into it lol still holding on to this one to see what it does.

AAPL - 3 @ 120.51 (+0.07%)

NET - 3 @ 75.35 avg (-11.54%)

CRSR - 5 @ 32.83 (+0.38%)

CRLBF - 6 @ 15.58 (-16.9%)

FSLY - 3 @ 74.27 avg (-11.89%)

FLGT - 1 @ 72.27 (+44.07%)

LMND - 1 @ 144.77 (-38.53%)

PINS - 5@ 72.32 avg (-5.69%)

VFF - 5 @ 17.04 (-19.57%)

Future prospects : Nintendo, Activision, Spotify, Tencent, Logitech, Sony, SiriusXM, Lovesac.

Would love some recommendations from you guys on ETFs so that I have a strong baseline in my portfolio. I’m definitely thinking in the long term now. Also interested to hear about green energy, EV, retail, travel, etc. Pretty much open to anything so I can keep expanding my own knowledge!

I currently own AAPL, PLTR, NIO, XPENG, VACQ, ARKF, ARKG and am down significantly. Sure the recovery stocks may have a 10% upside at the moment but long term, they are stagnant and can’t expect much growth from them if they don’t drastically change their business plans.","['TSLA', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ']"

The Suez Canal connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean via The Red Sea. As much as 30% of the world's shipping container freight typically passes through the Suez Canal every day. That is a shit ton of tonnes.

There is some money to be made but my thesis is the worlds shipping lines will see inflated freight contract prices in the short term if these ships have to start sailing around the Cape of Good Hope (that is the southern tip of Africa). [Currently 200 ships are backed up waiting for passage through the canal](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/suez-canal-ship-blocked-traffic-jam_n_605de99fc5b65d1c2814f17f) which is holding up about $400M in goods per hour.

According to my estimates (calculations here - [https://i.imgur.com/mRAPmqr.png](https://i.imgur.com/mRAPmqr.png)) it gives an estimated 5yr value of $127/share for $APPH, a potential 7X increase from todays share price of $17.81!

mdedab,gsa3et2,stocks,comment,1616758502,"Thanks for linking this. Does AppHarvest discuss the strategy on how they plan to successfully grow their business to $467M run rate?

For example, BYND has three go to market strategies:

1. Direct consumer sales - They continue to expand how many stores will carry BYND product

2. Restaurant/FastFood relationships - They recently partnered with McDonalds to offer a green veggie based food line. https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-announces-strategic-global-agreement-mcdonalds

3. Consumer Staples partnerships - They have announced a partnership with Pepsico to offer plant based protein snacks (ie. Frito Lay chips?): https://www.beyondmeat.com/whats-new/beyond-meat-and-pepsico-establish-and-introduce-the-planet-partnership/

I haven't dug into Appharvest, but I agree that AgTech is going to be interesting in the next 10 years. Chris Hadfield was interviewing James Cameron back in November 2020 and James Cameron said that he's focusing his attention on AgTech and technology to solve food insecurity. He said that there is so much mindshare in the EV/cleanpower space that he instead is directing his attention to a space that doesn't have so many eyes on it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOgs1VO7dA

(Its a long interview but enjoyable)

Also, why is APPH being shorted?

Most stocks have a political or macro reason to be shorted. TSLA was shorted for political reasons, as HF's that were loyal to traditional energy (ie. coal, oil/gas) had vested interests to see TSLA falter. GME was shorted because it was seen as a dying legacy business model in a digital industry. AMC was shorted for similar reasons, as more movies shift from theatres to direct-at-home.

Whats the logical behind APPH is being shorted?

BYND is volatile as the plant base protein space has two head winds:

1. Meat is still seen as a luxury good. And as incomes rise around the world, eating meat becomes a status symbol of wealth. This has been evidenced by the BRIC nations seeing higher meat consumption. Plant based proteins are good for the world as an aggregate, but most people are still concerned about the status symbol that meat provides.

2. Price and economies of scale. Its still cheaper to raise meat in many ways. 


Moreover, just perusing through AppHarvests' website: https://www.appharvest.com/

It looks like they're not focused on the actual go-to-market workflow that BYND is focusing on. They seem more focused on the actual growing. So I don't think this is an apples-to-apples comparison? Why are you comparing BYND to APPH? They don't seem too close to each other in market segment or industry.","['PEP', 'TSLA']"

> (i) authorised or regulated to operate in the financial markets; or

> (ii) a large undertaking meeting two of the following size requirements on a company basis:

IBUK may treat Clients as Elective Professional Clients if, based on an assessment of the Client’s expertise, experience, and knowledge, IBUK is reasonably assured that, in light of the nature of the transactions or services envisaged, the Client is capable of making its own investment decisions and understand the risks involved. Clients who do not meet the requirements to be categorised as Per Se Professional Clients can still request to be categorised as Elective Professional Clients.

This is absolutely absurd. Restricting access to something not inherently complex due to the above is absolutely insane. So beware anyone attempting to invest from the EU/UK, IBKR is an interesting platform for sure.

If anyone has an alternative brokerage that will ACTUALLY allow for the trading of US ETFs, that would be great.

[Bloomberg: Volkswagen as the next Tesla is firing up stock investors](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/volkswagen-as-the-next-tesla-is-firing-up-stock-investors-1.1581434)

Excerpt:

> The stock started taking off last week as investors bought into the Germany company’s plan to supplant Tesla Inc. as the global leader in electric cars. Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess made a series of announcements on his strategy to beat his California-based rival, emulating his counterpart at Tesla, Elon Musk. In return, VW common shares picked up a bit of Tesla’s cult status, soaring 60 per cent so far this month.

Also:

> Sell-side analysts tracked by Bloomberg factored the new prospects for the company’s EV plans into their models, leading to the average price target rising alongside shares. Yet for the moment only about 7.7 per cent upside is left in the preferred stock if the 12-month average target is any guide. Hence, no surprise that the number of analysts rating the stock a buy is right where it was when the rally began.

And:

> VW is a giant compared to Tesla when it comes to sales volume. The German carmaker sold more than 9 million cars last year versus just half a million for Tesla. And while VW is still trailing Tesla in terms of EV sales, the gap is closing fast with Volkswagen accelerating its growth from the low base. Yet Tesla’s market value is almost four times greater than Volkswagen’s after a stunning 743 per cent share price rally last year.","['TSLA', 'GPS']"

[The official press release said they hoped to close the merger by the end of the first quarter.](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public) That's next week.  No shareholder meeting has been scheduled.  No vote has been taken.  No additional guidance has been issued publicly by either company.

Enter CNBC, who had SoFi Anthony Nodo during the 11am hour today for an interview to discuss IPO's.  Promoted all morning, this would have been a great opportunity for host Jon Fortt or reporter Kate Rooney to ask for an update, right?  Eight minutes of discussion later, there was a great infomercial for SoFi's new service to allow retail investors to buy into IPO's, and of course there was the obligatory question about Gamestop now that CNBC has determined that's all their young demo cares about.   Guess what they didn't ask him?  About his own damn merger.  After eight minutes of air time.

At least the informercial diverted from Fortt's usual dump on social media in general, and often Facebook or Reddit specifically, but it failed in basic practices of journalism.  What is going on with SoFi's merger?  For that, you have to ask them yourself.  Apparently the preeminent network covering these things can't be bothered when the HAVE THE CEO SITTING RIGHT THERE.

If you email SoFi, you'll get the following:

>**Thank you for reaching out. We now expect the merger to close in April, although we do not yet have an exact date.**  
>  
>**IPOE shareholders are encouraged to reach out to Jonathan Gasthalter of Gasthalter & Co. at** [**SCH@gasthalter.com**](mailto:SCH@gasthalter.com) **with questions.**

If you email Mr. Gasthalter...crickets.

Maybe he would respond to CNBC.  If you actually want them to provide you news instead of company PR, however, you're apparently going to have to do the work yourself.

Going long and short on NDX at the same timeHello, I’m pretty new to day trading (I’ve been investing in ETFs for quite some time tho) and I’m not sure if what I tried in the last days makes sense or it’s just a newbie stupid mistake so I decided to ask more informed people here.

In the last days I tried, with paper trading, to open a long and a short position of the same amount (leveraged) on NASDAQ 100 in pre-market, just a few minutes before market opening, with a small SL.

The idea behind is that the big volatility at the market open will trigger the SL of one of the two positions and let the other one run long enough to cover the loss and gain a profit.

For now it worked, at least on paper trading. The profit, except for one time, wasn’t anything remarkable but I didn’t lose any money either.

So what I’m asking is: would it be risky/stupid to try it out on the real market? Is there something else that can go wrong except that the SL doesn’t trigger in time or that the movement is so fast that it just triggers both SL and leave me with a loss?

mdekqi,,stocks,post,1616725415,"What are your BEST strategies to avoiding emotional trading?**Quick background:**

So, I've been a long-term investor for nearly a decade now. I was of the mind-set of just ""set it and forget it,"" and would only look at my portfolio maybe a few times a week. FAANG still comprises the majority of my portfolio. Many of my positions are safe blue chips, some growth and value stocks that have rewarded me nicely over the years. I finally started taking profits on some of those investments.

I didn't start actively trading until January when the meme stonk craze brought me in...since then, I've been neglecting my day job (thankfully I work for myself) and trading incessantly. I've spent the past few weeks researching options and learning various strategies. I find myself excited for 4am to start the trading day. Some days I'll have my eyes on the market from 4am thru 8pm...active trading sure is a lot more fun than passive investing, but it's taking a toll...

**Emotional trading:**

Lately, I've noticed that I'm becoming more and more emotional with my trades. For example, when I'm loosing on a trade or taking losses, I'm itching to try to win it back. I find myself gambling and chasing stocks that are running...holding bag after bag...

It's been a stressful past 2 months since...I lost money on GME last month. I made the mistake of taking sizable positions in ARKG and ARKF at their absolute peaks. I liquidated a lot of my FAANG stocks to pick up hyper growth stocks that pulled back 30-60%...Suffice to say, my portfolio is seeing a lot of red these days, when historically it's been mega green.

Currently I'm also riding the meme stonks heavily and have been doing pretty well with my positions and options up until the massacre earlier this week. Now I'm looking for ways to negate my recent (soon to be) losses and throwing whatever dry powder I have into the market. I've gone from a patient, Warren Buffet style investor to a crazed WSB ape investor. I can probably use some balance at this point.

mdbpzi,,stocks,post,1616716043,"Finding the best buy (basic DD/ discussion): AMD, AMAT, NET, QCOMNET=  $67

-52 week high= $95.77

-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate -0.13, actually -0.12
-PE= Unavailable 
-ROE= -15.2%
-Net income= -120M
-Operating cash flow= -17M
1 year growth= +197%

I know everyone is saying that NET is a buy and that its a steal at this price... but when you look at the financial profile i just dont see it? I see its up 197% over the year which is a ton. Am i missing something? Outside of it being hit hard by the correction we are in i feel its very high risk

AMD= $76

-52 week high= $99.23
-BVPS= 4.82
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 1.23, actually 1.29
-PE= 237
-ROE= 58%
-Net income= 2.5B
-Operating cash flow= 1.1B
1 year growth= 67%
 
This is one im watching pretty heavily. I feel that the only downside i see to this one is that the PE is so high. However everything else looks solid. They have a heavy hand in the chip/ semi world too. Looking at the one year chart it had a massive upward spike around august/ September and now appears with this dip to be back on its normal trajectory. Its currently running below the 1 year 200 EMA also. And is running at the 5 year 50 EMA. this one to me seems like a for sure buy. Though i suspect this to still fall with the rest of tech for a little while longer. 

QCOM= $127.28

-52 week high= $167.94
-BVPS= 6.5
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 3.93, actually 4.19
-PE= 21.74
-ROE= 95%
-Net income= 5.2B
-Operating cash flow= 5.8B
1 year growth= 95%

Of the 4 listed this one has the lowest PE. It definitely took a little hit with this correction and is down a good bit. This one also had a large run up in 2020 and appears to be normalizing down on its trajectory sitting right above the 50 EMA for the 5 year and below the 200 EMA for 1 year. This company will have a heavy hand in 5G and while last year in my opinion priced a lot of that in i think itll still have a consistent growth which is what i want. It also has a dividend of 2.6 as a nice bonus. 

AMAT= $119.72

-52 week high= $125.8
-BVPS= 12.5
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 4.07, actually 4.17
-PE= 28.63
-ROE= 39%
-Net income= 3.62B
-Operating cash flow= 3.8B
1 year growth= +167%

AMAT is a backside play on the semiconductor world. They compared to the rest of the group have removed the best from this dip. I would almost say people are viewing this as a value play since its a manufacturer with a reasonable PE. I am curious if this will actually dip or not since its current running above the 20 EMA for 1 year. But i think this will continue to run as we are in such a massive shortage of chips. 

My order of buy would be

Anyway, I sold 2/3 after the run up but I'm still holding a normal size position for me (100 shares at this price) .  

QCOM is solid,  all the companies that deal with them hate the way they sell IP separately from chips and can therefore sell chips at a discount. However,  QCOM survived all the court challenges and have the only functioning 5G capability after IBM dropped out. When AAPL capitulated they signed a five year contract (going off memory here because it's late).  They are very powerful and make money,  lots and lots of money. 

Risks, well,  now that all the legal stuff is settled and they have long term contracts and are the undisputed leader in mobile tech, all that is priced in,  why would it do anything other than go up slowly paying a pittance for dividends (was 5% before).  

Also,  medium term,  IBM could make a better 5G chip (haha), or AAPL could make their own chips ( after the contract expires because they're well-known for making chips haha).

I bought my first set of shares in March of 2015 when their CEO made comments about starting to look at ways to cut costs (this is a normal part of every other business,  but They make too much money to care before that) so the last risk is that they don't have an culture of cost control and the stress is gone.   I held onto a double sized position until after the last earnings call when they didn't raise the dividend.   Dividends impose discipline. 

So yes,QCOM is the best out of the group,  but I'm only keeping it because I want to keep a little exposure to tech.","['AAPL', 'IBM', 'QCOM', 'IP']"

mczt4d,,stocks,post,1616683320,"$FNKO – Their Future of Margin and Revenue Expansion**TLDR** (posting at the top since this is a long post and I am occasionally a nice guy): FNKO sees the future of the collectibles market and is preparing for it. The company will see much better margins and likely a higher multiple as they become more tech-driven, which should make the stock go up to reflect their pivot. I believe the margin of safety is solid while the potential upside is very high, thus giving this an excellent risk/reward profile.

If you have ventured into your local GME store or visited their website then you are likely aware of or even potentially a fan of Funko’s products. FNKO obtains licenses from well-known franchises including movies, sports teams, comics and more in order to make their very recognizable and unique collectibles as well as apparel, games, and accessories.

Before talking about the future, let us look at the present. Their last quarter was fantastic, here are some of what I consider are the key things to be aware of:

* Net sales increased 6% to $226.5 million
* Gross margin increased to 37.2%
* Cash flow from operations increased 69% to $46.9 million
* Net sales of non-figure products grew 30% compared to 2019, primarily driven by strength within its Loungefly branded products which increased 51% in the quarter
* Funko's direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to prior year driven by continued strong demand on its e-commerce sites
* 68% of sales were attributable to evergreen content

**Here is my interpretation of the points above:** Sales are up and direct-to-consumer is a growing share of their sales as well as ‘evergreen’ content which essentially represents their products that are not tied to fleeting events. Additionally, they are growing revenues in product areas outside of the collectible figurines that they are known best for. The business as it exists today is healthy, which gives us a positive outlook for the future as it is as well as a good margin of safety for the stock price because of this since it appears to have a trajectory towards continued success and stockholder returns.

**But we are here for the big wins, now aren’t we? Let me pose a few questions:**

*If you wanted to take a healthy company with a loyal fanbase and have it earn more money without straying from what makes the company successful in the first place, what would you do?*

I would say that you would try to delight your customer base with new options to choose from to keep them happy and boost revenues while also doing what you can to not let those new options turn inventory management into a nightmare.

*If you had a company that made its money from physical products, what would you do?*

The way to make more money from physical products is to increase margins by cutting manufacturing and/or selling costs or by increasing prices.

*Who are FNKO’s primary customer types and what are some key characteristics of those customers?*

FNKO has a mix of customer types from people who like specific products that relate to a specific license to collectors who build complete collections of products to either keep or sell for a higher price. For either type of customer, I’d say FNKO is quite able to encourage multiple purchases over time (seriously, I haven’t seen an owner of a FNKO product only own one FNKO product) but the collectors are who I want to focus on for this post. Collectors want to build and complete collections, so if they are passionate about doing so with FNKO products, it would behoove FNKO to provide new ways of doing so in a way that makes it easier to verify and trade those collections if desired.

*Bro, what the fuck. Are you ever going to get to the fucking point?*

Now that I have shared the key things that I think is important to the environment FNKO is in today, I can now share what I believe will make FNKO rapidly grow their earnings: **NFTs**

*The fuck is a NFT?*

I think of NFTs as digital collectibles with built-in verification systems. These verification systems are essentially digital receipts that use blockchain technology to make forgeries more difficult and reduces the time it takes to check the legitimacy of a collectible when exchanges are desired. These are built into the collectibles themselves. For collectors, this is big. NFTs are still not very mainstream but amongst the collector community, I think these will be the future and will become extremely relevant. I personally do not collect things myself but it doesn’t take more than a couple brain cells to realize that collectors would want it to be as easy as possible to know that what they are buying is legit and as easy as possible to show people that what they are selling is legit. NFTs enable this to be done much more easily and quickly, leading to less fraud and a less painful experience for those who are into building/trading collections.

*How would NFTs help FNKO?*

As briefly discussed above I would say that if you want to improve upon an already-successful business, you would want to keep your customers happy while expanding margins and opening new revenue possibilities.

If FNKO begins to tie NFTs to limited-run physical items or sells limited numbers of the NFTs themselves, they could create a win-win for both themselves and the segment of their customer base that likes to collect, while also pulling in new customers who see a well-known company with well-known licenses creating content to collect and trade. With NFTs, FNKO can delight customers with new ways to collect while also streamlining the experience and solving some of the issues that make collecting difficult (verifying goods and trading them).

For FNKO, items tied to NFTs can be sold for more money which increases their margins since digital goods do not cost as much to build and scale (that is why tech companies trade at high P/S and P/E multiples). Because items are digital, it becomes easier for FNKO to react to trends in what customers want and can create limited release items and sell the NFTs right away and build/ship the physical items at a later date. Hell, they could also become a middleman between collectors and hold the physical items on behalf of whoever owns the NFTs and deliver at the request of the NFT owner (while picking up storage fees along the way for saving the NFT owners the trouble of holding/shipping the physical product while they wait to trade the NFT to a buyer. I do not know exactly how FNKO will implement NFTs into their business but you can see that some massive potential for fantastic customer/business win-win scenarios exists.

**Conclusion:** Because FNKO has a healthy business today, I believe that it has an excellent risk/reward profile because even if they totally botched the NFT rollout their existing business will be fine. I think NFTs provide a very enticing opportunity for the business to keep current customers happy, bring in new collector-customers, and increase margins while increasing revenues which would logically make the stock price go up due to both better earnings per share and a more tech-related multiple on those earnings.

*Is FNKO even planning on using NFTs?*

You’re damn right they are: [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html)

*Are there other NFT-related stocks?*

Yes, but most of them are just penny-stock garbage and none of them to date have a combination of track record plus logical business sense anywhere close to FNKO.

**Disclosures:** I am not a financial advisor, I’m just an everyday idiot like everyone else here. The only difference is that I drink so much coffee that I occasionally become a functioning human. I am long shares, 4/16 20c and 25c as well as some 11/19 20c. I personally consider $50 my minimum target (both because I firmly believe it plus it is a lucky number for me since I had the same minimum PT for GME back when it was below $20). I have no idea what the ceiling is, but I just know that NFTs have way too much synergy with the existing business for me to ignore. I like this stock, my opinions are my own and I should probably be ignored because I ran out of coffee halfway through writing this.

Good luck to all, please have some semblance of logic with your plays if you decide to pick up some FNKO positions.",

I don't think this is the same deal as Beanie Babies or Troll Dolls. They've tapped into a completely different market, first with gamers, then with a wider general audience, licensing recognizable characters from popular franchises. Beanie Babies doesn't have a video game or marvel movie demographic. And at this point, they've been around long enough to have a captured fanbase of their own that will remain loyal as long as there are new IPs to license.

**\[Very Long Post\]**

# What’s the story of the company?

[TSM](https://imgur.com/0IJCk3R) is the biggest chip foundry to provide 7 & 5 nanometer chips that became very popular after Apple moved their chip design in-house. Apple isn’t the only company that works with TSM with other big names like AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Qualcomm and even companies that also build their own chips like INTEL & NXP use TSM do increase their capacity.

Late last year the company also received approval to build a $12B chip plant in Phoenix, which will be a welcomed by the US, as chip demand has far outpaced the supply currently available around the world.

I know it might sound weird, but guys, in my opinion, I believe this $500B [company](https://imgur.com/gMPb0Pb) which has risen by more than 150% in the last year after the 2020 lows, still has some room to grow 

# Competition & Product 

I believe that TSM has a great advantage compared to companies that operate in their industry, as they have invested huge amounts of money in capital expenditures to gain competitive advantages compared to Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Broadcom & others.

We can also take a look at what Seeking Alpha Quant Factor [grades](https://imgur.com/KIQyCtO) the company, and we can see that TSM does pretty good in all 5 categories, Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum & EPS Revisions.

One other thing we can see here, is that after the huge spike in price, the dividend yield of the company still has room to recover, as the 4-year average yields stands at over 3%, second only to Qualcomm

# MOAT – Easy to replicate? Branding value? Dominance over Marketplace? TAM?

You are also probably wondering what is the MOAT of the company? Do they have a branding value or some kind of dominance over the Marketplace?

Well, from my point of view, TSM has a significant MOAT against most of its competition as they’ve been able to collect huge amounts of knowledge from its diverse base of over 500 customers which have helped them leap ahead of other companies since the 7NM move in 2018.

TSM pretty much [supplies](https://imgur.com/l5ekttM) all the big companies I mentioned earlier which later pass on the technology to their customers, so it’s very likely that you are using one of their chips in some of your devices, maybe your iPhone, your car, computer or anything else.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/M9MMUfn), the MOAT TSM has over Intel, as Intel is still a long way back, working on older generation chips, while TSM is leading the pack.

I believe their market dominance in the 7NM & 5NM chips will continue to keep TSM as the preferred manufactured for most fabless companies just like Apple which currently [represents](https://imgur.com/TkAR5kR) over 20% of TSM revenues, it seems to me that TSM is the best foundry to own for the next decade, as the worldwide revenue of semis [topped](https://imgur.com/X9iqLlY) $40B to start 2021, with [TSM](https://imgur.com/3unNxtB) being the only one of its pears to see a significant growth, with a big chunk of that coming from the huge demand Apple will provide them for the 5NM chips, which accounts for over 50% of their 5NM [sales](https://imgur.com/OyfFsEN).

Friends, this is just my opinion, but I even dare to say that their total addressable market it’s pretty much limitless in the foreseeable future.

Semiconductors are here to stay as technology will only continue to evolve, with smaller & smaller chips in the future and competitors still struggling to catch up with the 5NM technology that TSM already has, so TSM should be poised to remain one of the biggest companies in the world for the foreseeable future

I believe now is the time we need to get to some of the company’s financials & metrics

# Company Growth & Balance Sheet

Revenue/ Net Income Growth? Profitability?

Let’s start by taking a [look](https://imgur.com/mvUGLnO) at how the companies revenues and gross profit have evolved in the past years, and we can see that with the exception of 2018, TSM has seen a continued growth with 2020 being a booming year as gross profit increased by more than 50% with operating income also increasing by more than 60%, which in my eyes is pretty remarkable given the size of the company.

[TSM](https://imgur.com/jHWdJrY) has managed to post a positive net income in the last 10 years, seeing an increase of over 400% in that same period, so, I hold the opinion that this will continue on the same path for the next 10 years as well 

# Cash / Debt / Net Debt & Dilution

Looking at the balance [sheet](https://imgur.com/MUCFRtx) of the company, we also find that TSM has an excellent financial situation, with over $38B in current assets, which can easily pay off the $22B in current liabilities or the $32B in total current & long-term [liabilities](https://imgur.com/kE1mKDV), so the company is way more than solvent.

# Lastest Earnings Reports & Predictions of Revenue Streams / Cost of Sales & Others

It seems to me that TSM [posted](https://imgur.com/mmqloyJ) some terrific numbers yet again in Q4 of 2020, delivering almost $13B in revenues up 22% YoY with 5NM technology already accounting for 20% of wafer revenue as the 5G technology and super-cycle is just starting, with telecom companies struggling to keep up with the increasing demand.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/ZGM9b2N) that the 5NM was already the 2nd biggest revenue stream for the company in the 4th quarter and I would say that it’s pretty likely only going to increase, as this only accounted for 8% of 2020’s [revenues](https://imgur.com/RJmakFU), especially as Smartphone [account](https://imgur.com/B7UHPHO) for almost half of TSM revenues from last year, with only the automotive sector seeing a small decline, which was expected, but should recover in the next years, as cars had a bad year given the events of 2020 and they will also very likely contain more & more chips as companies continue to innovate.

TSM also provided a revenue guidance similar to last quarter as gross profit margins are still expected to come in at over 50% 

# Dividends?

One last thing that we should look at before moving on to future projections is how the company is continuing to growth their [dividend](https://imgur.com/Kxhyy2b). 

As far as I am concerned, dividend investing is not really my favorite but this is an important thing to look at when looking for companies to buy to maintain a balanced portfolio.

TSM only offers a $1.79 dividend but this has seen a 13.5% growth rate in the past 5 years and given that things are only getting better, I think this can continue as well.

I guess now’s the time to move on to what is the current upside and the long-term potential for TSM

# Current Upside / Long Term Upside?

First, let’s start with my [expectations](https://imgur.com/r87yUGF) of the revenue streams, costs of goods, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

I believe we can continue to see a steady growth in their total sales, that will end up doubling by 2025, reaching over $108B. On the other side, I also believe we can continue to see a gross margin of 54%, similar with what we saw last quarter.

The other operating expenses from R&D and SG&A I pretty much expect to remain the same, as this has been steady over the years, so, a 2.7% of the revenues should go in SG&A and 8.3% should continue to go into continued R&D to keep the companies MOAT.

I would say that TSM is very likely to continue to invest a lot of money in Capex to keep up with the increasing semiconductors demand, so this should continue to grow at around 2.5%/year.

All of these numbers should get us an operating income of almost $27B for 2025, though, there are other things like interest income & expenses that we should account for, but for TSM, this should add up to a slight gain of $400M in 2025.

Finally the effective tax rate of the [company](https://imgur.com/pkOEifS), has stood under 12% for the last 3 years, but, for safety reasons I will imply a small increase each year, which would [result](https://imgur.com/KbtxhZG) in TSM having a net income of just over $24B in 2025, paying out a dividend of $3.24, while also not diluting their shares, as TSM hasn’t [diluted](https://imgur.com/oflEVtF) their stock significantly since 2005.

# Price to Earnings (PE) Valuation

PE Valuations are my favorite way to quickly & pretty accurately determine reasonable future prices for stocks. 

Taking into account all the numbers we went through earlier, my [view](https://imgur.com/gwgvpXI) is that we can see TSM trading anywhere between a 25 and a 40 PE by 2025, which given the $4.64 EPS for 2025 would mean the stock can trade between $116 and $185, but, before moving on to the final price targets let’s also take a quick look at TSM discounted free cash flow valuation.

# DCF 

I [implied](https://imgur.com/hNWP9E2) the same growth rate for TSM revenues and actually lowered their EBIT as a % of their revenues each year by .5%, and after taking into account their effective tax rate, their D&A, capital expenditures and net working capital I arrived at a $71.5B free cash flow by 2025.

As always I also added their net assets and used a 3% long-term growth rate just to be conservative and for the perpetuity approach we got a price target of $86, meaning the company is potentially overvalued at the moment, though, on the other hand, the EBITDA approach, using a 20x multiplier, would results in a price target of $178. 

I like to use an average approach of this numbers, which would results in a price target of $132, or a 21% upside in the next 12 months for the company, not including any additional dividends received.

# Technical Chart

Looking at a short-term [chart](https://imgur.com/qgvPpXM), we find that TSM is pretty underbought right now with an RSI of 36, but the volumes in the stock are slightly increasing.

It seems to me that the next support level for TSM stands at $103 while the next resistance is just above my 12-month price target for the company, as TSM had a fake breakout over $135 in the middle of last month.

# Wall St. Opinion

I always take a look after I’ve finished my DD to what analysts say, and in this case, they have a $137 PT for the [company](https://imgur.com/xAVfqN4) slightly higher than my own DD, so it seems I was pretty accurate with my expectations.

[Analysts](https://imgur.com/l6EndWo) also expect a 72B on average, while my estimates are the top end of their range, but on the other hand, I only have an EPS of 4.64$ in 2025, compared to $5.6 expected by them by 2023.

# Weaknesses

When looking at what companies you should invest in, it’s recommended to also take into account their potential weaknesses.

I have no doubt that TSM does have some weaknesses, but probably the biggest one is that they really so much on their Apple revenues, though, it’s hard to believe Apple will move away from TSM anytime soon, or even if that happens that TSM won’t find other customers in need of their products in a short period of time, especially now with the huge worldwide chip shortage.

While writing this post, we also received [news](https://imgur.com/MCjAWXZ) from INTEL that they are planning on building 2 new foundries in Arizona. This might provide even more pressure on the current price of TSM, but, in my humble opinion, i think this just more buzz, with Intel still laggining behind in technology, not even having the 7NM available, while TSM is already working on 2 & 3NM developments. So, i'd take this as another opportunity to ""buy the dip""

# Short Selling? Institutional Holding?

The company has such a solid future that the percentage of [shares](https://imgur.com/wl06zGs) sold on the short side is under .3%, which is one of the lowest I have ever seen in a company.

Though, on the other hand, the stock isn’t that largely [owned](https://imgur.com/ndoKXcs) by institutions, with JP Morgan leading the pack with under 1%, buy, my guess is that’s because this isn’t a US based company, which does make it less attractive to big investment banks & funds.

I bet that you are just waiting to see the final price targets and my final opinion, so let’s jump to that right now

# Final Opinion & Prediction!

In my [opinion](https://imgur.com/P7OQKtb), TSM is a must have stock in most portfolios, brining some balance, with good growth ahead of it. TSM might helped lower the beta of most portfolios that are way to heavy on the overhyped tech stocks right now.

Remember, this is just my humble opinion as a retail investor, this is not an investment advice, but my view is that we can see TSM moving towards the $132 range by early next year, with TSM likely to be jump-started again around their next [earnings](https://imgur.com/ClXzJZG) report in April 

Regarding the long-term [view](https://imgur.com/dgQTLy7), my base TSM target is $150 by 2025, meaning an ROI of 38% which is not that great, but when taking into account the expected dividends received from TSM, that can jump to over 50% 

Speaking personally, my 2025 Price [Targets](https://imgur.com/9ZWdcb5) for TSM range from an average of the 25 & 30 PE multiple, my base case from the 30 & 35, while my bull case averages de 35 & 40 PE multiple prices.

It used to be that I’d come across down right nonsensical (worse than bad) posts or comments every other week. However in the past month that number has increased to once every other day....and sorry but it mostly comes from the dividend investing crowd and the TSLA fan-Boiz. 


Edit: Apparently I need to explain this to the TSLA fan-boiz. First, I’m not saying Cathie is dumb, where in this post do you see her name? Second, I’m mostly referring to the boiz who say “I’m new to investing and I already made ____ in profit with TSLA (or other meme stock), you just don’t know how to invest.” 


Today I was trying to explain to someone what Dividend irrelevance theory is...and somehow this person determined that you can have a 13% “guaranteed” rate of return no matter what the stock price does; meaning the stock can crash 90% and your rate of return is still +13% or more for the year. Well turns out this guy calculates his rate of return by the number of shares bought buy his DRIP per stock....rather than growth/loss in the value of your investments. And ofc he felt like he cracked the investing code of ancient wisdom that us plebs don’t know. So his idea was to buy high yield stocks, hold on and never sell....according to this user it was impossible to lose money with a dividend stock because it always pays a dividend.....I think this takes the cake for worst advice/logic I’ve seen on this sub and that’s saying a lot. 


So I think it’s a great time to remind people. Be careful whom you take advice from. Especially on Reddit and YouTube. There’s a few users out there that are good, but the majority don’t know what they’re doing half the time.",['TSLA']
mcoy9k,gs5gyo3,stocks,comment,1616664055,"You should be careful with what everyone says. This is why rhetorical thinking matters. People are very biased and will try to convince you into thinking in a way that best suits there own agendas. The color of the candles are forms of manipulation. Stocks imo are a big psychological game.

Wanna know my recent example? With the Chinese delisting fears once again being brought up. My friends who are NIO bulls will say the SEC delisting fears are nonsense. Then my same friend will sell and try to time the bottom and try to create fear by making a big deal about it. But once he buys back into the stock he goes around saying it's no longer an issue and it's just ""noise"". 

Another example is all these articles being posted. This is why I always want to know where investors are coming from. I wish there was more transparency. I don't use WSB like I did years ago. But I loved the ""position or ban"" rule. Then you can see why someone is bullish or bearish on a stock. It makes much more sense why someone says certain things.

Also, most  people started investing this year or last year. So I am always extra careful. I have had many interesting conversations today.",

md96rf,,stocks,post,1616708503,"Price corrections and pullbacks are normal. Don't panic.Too many idiots and doomers here are thinking that this signals the ""end of tech stocks"" or that it's a sign that you should invest in some Boomer stocks, bonds, or something excessively safe. No. It's a price correction, and the end of highly overpriced valuations. If you have rational faith in a company and its future growth, then just fucking hold and buy the dips when possible. If you're down even 50%, as long as you aren't in some very risky, iffy positions, you will make it back in time. It might take even a few years, but hopefully, the new retail investors/traders have learned their lessons now.

Just because NASDAQ is suffering a correction on the order of months, it doesn't mean that tech or growth stocks overall don't have a future on the order of years. And anybody who tells you otherwise is either salty because they bought high or just wants to feel better about their slow-growth positions. Just avoid speculating and do your own DD.

Anyways, to put this into personal context, I've probably lost more than the majority of you on this subreddit (over 30% of my port), but even I think that the lessons I've learned during this past few months will make me a much better investor and trader from here on out. I started investing late and missed almost all of the tech/growth stocks rally during the past year. I jumped into my positions about a month before this recent price correction started and lost a massive amount of money, largely also because I borrowed off of margin. So in other words, I borrowed off of margin during basically the worst time possible, and I also used it on some of the most meme-y, fad stocks (including EV, ARK ETFs, you name it), so I suffered some of the largest losses. But I'm not gonna lose hope, and you shouldn't either, because I know that time in the market beats timing the market anytime. 

Just wait and you'll make everything back as long as you've learned from your mistakes, whether that be buying when things are high, FOMOing into growth stocks when they're long due for a pullback, or being scared to just hold or buy through the dips. And ofc, if you don't want to trust me because I'VE made some shitty moves in these past few months, then you don't have to, but this post also paraphrases loads of advice given to me from much more experienced investors and traders. Take it as you wish. Think of me (or at least who I've been) as the example of what not to do.",['NDAQ']

mdl6jy,,stocks,post,1616752449,"OptimizeRx - long term stock, reasonably valued, good entryA company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx operates as a digital health company that provides communications solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads, therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration, sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information, lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms, and surveys. 

The most compelling part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to really cash in on this.

So traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products. They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their respective company to engage.

Well this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform, which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals, doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.  

""When a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc., to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way, businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR. Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

&#x200B;

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of 18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M. 

So what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with posting positive operating income.

OPRX didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call transcript:

*Analyst: ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type  revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get  there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should  scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep talking about""*

He also said: *"" In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4) they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient, further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

&#x200B;

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C), OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies, medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation. 

So TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2) business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the doctor in person.

(3)  outlook -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

&#x200B;

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales agent.

The business shifted into the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500% yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total addressable market.

It recently pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday. And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX does.

I would highly, highly not recommend buying or selling anything until you have an understanding of what you’re buying. Otherwise you risk losing a ton of your money.

Right now, educate yourself. Learn about ETFs and mutual funds first. They are easy to understand and (mostly) very risk averse. Index funds are among the most solid and stable investments there are. They will also provide very large returns over the years. 

The S&P 500 has returned around 255% over the last 10 years (not inflation adjusted, dividends reinvested). If $150k had been invested then it would be worth $532.5k today. Not a bad return at all.

mdajy7,,stocks,post,1616712427,"UCTT - DD - an almost ""value"" play in the semi conductor sector?I know PE is not the main thing when talking about tech/growth stocks, but finding a small cap company in the semis sector with a good PE that is also making good money? I think I just found one. Actually, I had this stock last year at some point, a couple of ks worth, and sold it after some 25% gain. I don't remember why.  But now to the DD

**Company profile**

(from yahoo finance)

Sector(s): **Technology**

Industry: **Semiconductor Equipment & Materials**

Full Time Employees: **4,355**

Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures production tools, modules, and subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment markets in the United States and internationally.

*It primarily serves original equipment manufacturing customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor integrated device manufacturing industries, as well as display, consumer, medical, energy, industrial, and research equipment industries.* Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Hayward, California.

**Customers (👍👍👍👍👍)**

As can be seen in the link below, some of the big names in semis are customers of UCTT (e.g. ASML, TSM, AMAT, LAM, Agilent, SMIC)

[**https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets\_glance.php?code=UCTT**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=UCTT)

&#x200B;

**Last quarter results (👍👍👍👍👍)**

Q4 revenue increased by 29.1% YoY to $369.6M, setting a new quarterly record for the fourth straight time. Non-GAAP EPS increased by 102.5% to $0.81. The GAAP numbers for Q4 FY2019 got skewed by restructuring charges and other fair value adjustments, which lowered EPS by $0.33 and $0.16 respectively, and resulted in a loss of $0.26 per share.

**Growth (👍👍👍👍👍)**

I will not bore you with the whole details here, but if you are interested you can check at the link below for growth comparison at the sector and industry level

[https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=UCTT](https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=UCTT)

some highlights from the link above:

Y/Y growth of 29%, and 5 year average growth rate of 24.4% (for comparison, corresponding values for S&P are -3.24 and 7.37, Tech:7.9% and 12.6%, Semis: 15.9% and 12.8%)

**Profitability (👍👍)**

Also, detailed tables here

[https://csimarket.com/stocks/Profitability.php?code=UCTT](https://csimarket.com/stocks/Profitability.php?code=UCTT)

Some highlights:

operating/net margin is considerably lower than industry (e.g. average 5 year margin of 6% compared to industry average of 21%)

**Market Outlook (👍👍👍👍)**

According to the most recent [world fab forecast](https://www.semi.org/en/news-resources/market-data/world-fab-forecast-report-highlights-q1-2021) report from SEMI, the WFE market is expected to expand by 15.5% to $74.6B in 2021. In comparison, the WFE market grew by 16% in 2020. It is expected to grow by 12% to $83.6B in 2022.

UCTT  has not given a guidance for all of 2021 (except that they will try to beat the WFE market by 10%), which they have managed to do in each of the last 5-6 years. This implies that their target is roughly 25% annual growth in 2021.

**Valuation (👍👍👍👍)**

As of today, the PE is 27.5. At first I thought this was so cheap because I was comparing to the big names in the semis (e.g. ASML: 57, NXPI: 1063 (WTF!),). But comparing to competitors it seems very close in valuation (e.g. ICHR:32, MKSI:27)

However, forward PE seems quite attractive, just 16 for next year (according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uctt/price-earnings-peg-ratios](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uctt/price-earnings-peg-ratios))

**Market share (??)**

Was not able to get proper information on how the market share is compared to competitors.

**Conclusions ( )**

I like the stock:-)

It is having a great run lately  (17% 1month, 70% YTD, 151% 6M), and still holding well in the tech pullback lately. The company is still only has a 2.1B market cap and provides an essential service to some of the biggest names in the semi-conductor industry. I won't be surprised if this one goes 2x or even 3x the next couple of years.

I don't own any shares yet, but planning to dip my toes in it soon.

With the new focus being growth in the American manufacturing market it’s a negligible concern but worth mentioning.

As for market share this isn’t my best work, but it’s late and didn’t feel like querying the raw data to filter semiconductor sales. So as a lose estimate their market share is modest, but improving fast. As a quick work around I just sampled two less valued companies SK Hynix (5.4% market share) and Texas Instruments (3.2%). Weighing this against their current market cap (I get it this is not a true estimate but it’s a ratio involving perceived value) SK is values at 97.19tr KRW or 85bn USD and TI is 164.75bn. I used both companies since if UCTT is undervalued then they’ll likely fall closer to a company that’s not on the US market they’ll be less inflated and weight it with a US producer. 

**TLDR** UCTT has a market cap of 2.11bn so that a loosely approximated 0.07% market share. However considering their still scaling it’s a good opportunity.

Their market share is modest, but it’s a big industry where major

md0fle,gs8l3se,stocks,comment,1616718848,"For a bearish argument, there's insurance companies to consider. Health insurance companies tell medical companies, like a hospital or your Dr office, how much it will pay them for the service/drug/procedure/exam, etc. If the company says ""a tele-health visit costs $100,"" insurance will counter offer $50. If you can't get insurance approval for certain things involving the operation of your business, then it becomes unsustainable to continue to operate in that way. 

This can work both ways for TDOC. If insurance companies decide it's great and will save THEM money, they'll be in great shape. Then new tele-health companies will have to compete for insurance approval against already established TDOC. If insurance companies decide that in person visits cost the same for them to reimburse so either is ok, then they're good to go too as long as the operating costs are less than the reimbursement for the services because the actual overhead of the company submitting the reimbursement request doesn't really matter. If another company comes in an under bids TDOC, or some other more nefarious shit goes on, there's a chance that insurance companies will choose to utilize the new, cheaper company and TDOC is out of that system. This already happens with system based coverage so it's not hypothetical (your employer provided insurance will pay for St. Helen's Hospital system affiliated providers, and your PCP is St Jude so you have to switch). 

Not saying telemedicine and tele-visits aren't the future, they are because the population is inherently lazy and will always, as an overall whole, choose convenience when it benefits them (see GrubHub, doordash, instacart). But competition will be harsh and the medical industry is jacked up. 

TDOC acquiring LVGO was huge for them, if they can utilize the assets. I'm long term bullish on TDOC. However, I don't currently hold any, they've been branded a ""covid play"" and the market don't care about TA or value analysis (good P/B ratio, fair book value per share, good debt/equity ratio). I'm guessing the pullback is based on their debt going from $470M to $1.4B and a negative EPS, negative profit margin, etc. from the merger, plus the fear that tele-health is going out with covid.

md10km,,stocks,post,1616686510,"Why Apple keeps dropping.Apple seems like a solid company and they keep punching - even when it seems like they're a commodity company with commodity products.

But why do they keep faltering?  I've taken some big hits and I kept wondering why my investments kept dying...until I zoomed out. Apple has retraced every single ATH gap up that I can remember since 2007ish. Apple has had plenty of gap ups, but the concerning ones are gap ups that take the stock to an ATH. On July 31st 2020, apple gapped up to new ATHs.

Back in July of 2020, [Apple announced a 4:1 stock split.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2020/07/31/apple-announces-4-for-1-stock-split-to-bring-in-new-investors/?sh=62ba0f2b5401) This was around the same time that TSLA did the same thing. There was a ton of market euphoria and guess what happened when apple announced its split? 95 > 108. Nearly a 15% gain in a matter of days. And the stock kept going up from there.

Take a look at the gap up back in July 31st of 2020.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/EjY0kYu1/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EjY0kYu1/)

If I had to throw some chips on Red it would a retrace to $100ish before earnings and then a steady climb to $150 following that.

md8gnc,,stocks,post,1616706464,"DKNG weekly callI’ve been buying stocks theses last couple years but really been trying to get into the game these last couple months.  Prior to today, I only had stocks but decided to play around with options with TD Ameritrade.   I purchased 1 April 1st call at a strike price of 67 for 1.88c.  According to TD’s risk profile my max loss would be around $188 and max profit would be $600 something.  

My question is what’s my next move?  I’m starting small so I don’t blow up the entire portfolio on my first options move. 

Apologies ahead of time for the noob question.

Current positions $CVNA $DKNG $GNOG $SCR",
md8gnc,gs83ov2,stocks,comment,1616710150,"You purchased a long call with a strike price of $67 for a debit of $188 = 1.88x100 and an expiration of April 1st. The maximum risk here is the debit you provided, $188, and the maximum return is theoretically infinite. The ~$600 max profit was being calculated for a given range, likely at expiration. The breakeven for your option at expiration is 67+1.88 = $68.88. Therefore, at expiration on April 1st if DKNG is at exactly $68.88 then you will make $0 (minus any transaction fees you incurred). If it closes under $67 then you will lose the entire premium you debited ($188) and if it closes above the breakeven then you would profit whatever the difference is between that closing price and your breakeven. (e.g. It closes at $71 on April 1st and you make 71-68.88 = 2.12x100 = $212). 

If you do nothing at all, your broker, or the Option Clearing Corporation (OCC) on your behalf, will automatically exercise an option that is ITM by at least $0.01 (e.g. DKNG at $67.01 or greater) and you will receive a credit in your account for the profit. All of this only considers the intrinsic value of the option at expiration.

You can also sell the option prior to expiration and it may have some additional value (extrinsic value) in addition to any intrinsic value it has. For example, if DKNG hits $70 tomorrow, and assuming constant implied volatility, then the value of your option might rise to $370, which is greater than just the 70-68.88=$112 you would earn if this took place on April 1st at expiration. However, this extrinsic value decays over time as you approach your expiration date due to theta decay until only intrinsic value is left at expiration.

For what it's worth, it wasn't a terrible long call to buy and I think you stand a good chance of making some kind of profit here, although who knows especially in this market lately. I suggest setting a profit goal, at which point you should sell-to-close your option. E.g. If it hits 50% profit at any point between now and April 1st you sell the option and lock in your gain. Also, I would suggest reading some more stuff online before spending more money on options. This type of out-of-the-money (OTM) call purchase with a weekly expiration is highly unlikely to succeed if repeated over time.",

md8gnc,gs84wmx,stocks,comment,1616710734,"1 call contract = you have the *right, but not the obligation* to buy 100 shares of a stock at the designated strike price x 100 until the designated date.

So, since you own an April 1st call at a strike price of $67, you have until April 1st the *right, but not the obligation* to buy 100 shares of DKNG for $67 each, so a total of $6700. This is regardless of the market price for DKNG. So, DKNG can hit $100 per share, and you'd still have the right to buy it for $67 per share.

This is how, in theory, you make money as a call buyer - the stock rises above your ""break even"" on the market, at which time you can buy the stock for the lower strike price you set, and then sell it on the market for profit.

Now, most options buyers won't be actually exercising their option. Instead, they'll be selling the option contract itself for a profit, once the underlying stock rises above the break even. This works just like a stock - your contract will rise in value as DKNG rises in price, and at some stage, you'll be able to sell it for more than you bought it for, at which stage you can decide to Sell to Close the contract and realize your gain.

But be careful - you only have until April 1st to sell or exercise the contract, after which it expires useless. Each day that passes where DKNG doesn't rise above $67, your option's value decreases. So most people will sell at a loss if they don't see any chance for DKNG to rise above $67 by April 1st. 

That then is the bet you're taking on - if DKNG rises about 2 dollars above $67, or around $69, by April 1st, you WIN and can sell the contract for a profit. If it doesn't, you LOSE and either the contract becomes useless on April 1st or you sell it at a loss before then.",

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-march-25.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures turn lower after Fed chief Powell comments

> * U.S. stock futures turned lower Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition” that Covid economic stimulus and vaccinations allowed the U.S. economy to recover faster than expected and that central bankers, at some point, may be able to pull back emergency support.

> * Late-day selling reversed gains and dragged the S&P 500 down 0.6% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped lower in the final seconds of Wednesday’s session. The Nasdaq dropped 2% after a slightly higher open gave way to a day of selling. Tech stocks were lower despite the 10-year Treasury yield holding below recent a 14-month high as a market rotation out of high-flying growth names continued. The Nasdaq last closed at a record last month. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs last week.

> * The Labor Department is set to report its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the stock market opens. Economists expect 735,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down 35,000 from the prior week, which saw an unexpected jump even as many states relaxed Covid mitigation restrictions on businesses.

*****

> # 2. AstraZeneca revises Covid vaccine data with lower efficacy rate

> * AstraZeneca late Wednesday issued updated Covid vaccine numbers from its late-stage trial in the U.S. and Latin America after U.S. health officials earlier this week questioned the accuracy of preliminary data. The U.K.-based drug giant now said its vaccine is 76% effective in protecting against symptomatic cases of virus. A release issued on Monday reported an efficacy rate of 79%. AstraZeneca reiterated its two-shot regimen was “well tolerated” among participants and no safety concerns were identified.

*****

> # 3. Biden to hold first news conference of presidency

> * The White House announced Thursday that it’s dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural communities. More than 25% of the entire U.S. population received at least one vaccine dose, including 14% who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two shots, while Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is only one shot.

> * Against the backdrop of rising Covid cases in many states and more than 30 million total U.S. infections, President Joe Biden is set to hold his first news conference. He’s expected to point to a surge in vaccinations, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the latest sweeping stimulus package. He’s also likely to face a wide range of questions from U.S.-Mexico border security to gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia.

*****

> # 4. Oil prices slide as Covid concerns outweigh Suez Canal disruptions

> * Oil prices fell Thursday as fuel demand concerns re-emerged alongside worries about steps back in the global fight against Covid. Prices of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude and the Brent international benchmark each dropped roughly 2%, one day after they both surged nearly 6% on the crude shipping disruptions caused by the grounding of a giant container ship in the Suez Canal, a major trade route. It could “take weeks” to clear, according to the CEO of a Dutch company helping with the salvage efforts.

*****

> # 5. Lawmakers to press tech CEOs over speech, misinformation

> * Big Tech leaders Thursday are scheduled to testify at a virtual House panel hearing on efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns Google and YouTube, will face increased pressure following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the rise in Covid vaccine misinformation. There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted online.

md20ir,,stocks,post,1616689090,"WMT DD best stock in my portfolio?\*disclaimer: this is my first DD... I'm taking time out of my office job to hear thoughts about my analysis.

Looking at my portfolio that I built in the past 4 months, WMT seems like the most undervalued stock.

I am not talking about any get rich quick stocks. Looking at you TSLA, PLTR, NIO, GME. (although I am invested $20k in these stocks and am about 20% down)

# 1. Why it will win in the next few years

The market volatility is here. We don't know if it's going to stay, but I am unsure about investing heavily in tech. I want a company that can weather the storm. Grocery/food retailer, especially low-cost chain, seems like a great place to invest in since their business model will bring even more customers in challenging times. The $1400 stimie is a boost that will flow into this sector while we move past the pandemic. 'WIN' here doesn't mean doubling stock price in the next few years. 'WIN' is beating the market. My goal is 4%+ annual.

# 2. On-line business model

Let's be frank here. Walmart doesn't have the greatest online presence. They are trying their best with Walmart+, but it's not there yet. Good news is that I don't think their online presence is 'priced-in', which means that the current valuation of the company doesn't account for how big it can actually get. The company still makes great revenue and margin in the space and there's room for growth.

# 3. Current valuation

The stock is currently down about 10% since the ATH (all time high) in Dec 2020. Not gonna lie, grocery stores did get a boost during the pandemic since a lot of people cooked more meals at home, but look at the 50 day moving average. The stock moved higher faster than anticipated, but it's trending well with the average line in the right direction. In the past 5 years, the stock has dipped below 50-day moving average a very few times.

While we are at it, let's look at some of the fundamentals:

PE: 28.14

PS: 0.67

PB: 4.66

These are some of the lowest number I see in my portfolio right now.

# 4. Is there a bear case?

From what I can see, very little. If WMT is down, I am pretty sure the whole market will be down. I also don't foresee them making poor business decisions in the coming future that will cause WMT to inverse the market growth.

# 5. Is there a better alternative?

Maybe Costco? but Walmart fundamentals are better with higher performing chart data. (I own Costco as well).

TLDR: WMT has solid fundamentals, is down 10% for no reason, is seriously undervalued right now, there's no bear case, no rising competition, potential huge growth with online presence, it's a BUY.

Walmart could grow year upon year, but a P/E that high doesn't need regular growth, they need break-out growth. Keep in mind retailer's margins aren't tech company margins, even most of Amazon's profit comes from AWS.   

Is Walmart a good buy? I have absolutely no idea, but you're definitely betting on something big at the current price and there absolutely could be a correction (in particular as they're priced like growth rather than value).","['AMZN', 'WMT']"

This is terrible for investors. The economy opening up is the worst thing for businesses here in the year of our lord 2021. The best thing to happen to the market?

 Stimulus. Well, stimulus was amazing for stocks, until the media decided it wasn't. Now it'd bad. Which brings us to inflation. One day treasury yeilds inching up a tad to expected levels is the scariest thing ever (oh my God! Inflation! Where did this alien thing come from and?!) and the worst thing to happen to tech in quite some time. What happens when those yeilds start to plummet? Oh it's also bad for tech.

md0jln,gs6ik5n,stocks,comment,1616686136,"Use this (it may turn out that ""the dip"" is not enough of a dip):  


So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.",

This rate tend to reset monthly. Next month the rate may jump to 0.20 then next month now you pay 1.3% annualized.

Now if you are trying to short something that everyone wants to short or they just don’t issue so many shares (hard to borrow list) then the cost of borrow is even higher.

The stock has been on a downtrend for some time but I have done some DD and checked their financials several times and I think at some point they should rebound and their market cap should better match their EV / EBITDA and book value. They're at a very low P/E multiple now compared to similar stocks.

I see there has been quite a good resistance... let's say... around X value.

Even during the pandemic, they paid dividends in cash and in stock. They have a very sufficient reserve for future dividends right now sitting in their last financial report. I expect they could deliver around 4% of their current market cap just in cash dividends.

Am I safe to assume that then I have a safeguard in case their price drops less than 4%?

Note: I'm not talking about a US stock so please detach this a bit from the current correction situation. This should be just about considering this dividend strategy in a vacuum.

mcx8tv,,stocks,post,1616675865,"Coinbase IPO 

I think everyone at this point knows that Coinbase will be going public and there is a lot of interest in getting in on the action before they actually go public.

There is actually a german based crypto exchange FTX that allows you to create a smart contract which will be tied to fractional equivalents of the Coinbase stock once it goes live. So that is how people are already buying / trading the Coinbase stock. 

As of today these contracts are going for about $404 giving Coinbase a valuation of around $70B. o.O

I know this is confusing for a lot of people not familiar with the crypto world and if you live in America you are technically not even allowed to buy in on these contracts.

So here is another way to get in on the Coinbase stocks early

Cathie Wood the founder and CEO of ARK investments is known to be a bull on Crypto and especiallly Bitcoin.

One of the funds that ARK controls is their ARKF or ARK Fintech.

I think it is a very fair assumption that once Coinbase IPO's that this fund will be picking up a large cache of Coinbase stock.

So if you want to get in on Coinbase early I suggest you load up on ARKF it is a safe bet to get in early on Coinbase without having to mess around with smart contracts. Get in while the price is right!",
mcx8tv,gs63vqi,stocks,comment,1616679783,"Wow, do not load up on ARKF just because you think it might allocate a few % to a future crypto related IPO. If you want crypto just buy Bitcoin. Is there any reason to buy coinbase stock instead of just Bitcoin?",

Because it is so over regulated, great cryptos are not listed on coinbase until much much later, if at all.  American investors in crypto often have to jump through hoops to be able to get cryptos that are not listed yet on American exchanges.    I've been annoyed particularly at coinbase for not listing Theta token before it was 1 USD , therefore taking the opportunity away from investors in America to benefit from a tech based in America.

md5loi,,stocks,post,1616698743,"As a swing trader - what are some other ways to make some profit in this market?I realized in february that things were going to be dry for a while, so I pulled all my swing positions out, and decided to fix my webull account (i made it a cash account by accident, so it took forever to switch to a margin account) and in 4 days, I'll be able to day trade (yes, I pass the 25k threshold).

I personally believe this will all be over within a month - I strongly believe the bull market will return - but until then, I... don't know how to make money with swings. I'm heavily invested in swinging (*not so much day trading, but the few times i've done it, it was very profitable for me... minus the GME fiasco, lol. Haven't touched those meme stocks in a long time, never will again*) and I would say 80% of my profit comes from those, but now that the market isn't performing well, it feels like its best to wait it out. 

However, I'm trying to see if theres any way i could make SOME profit in the meantime. I'm not asking to make 1k a day, but is it possible to make something like $100 in 3 days? Maybe I get more invested into day trading? puts perhaps (I'm very inexperienced in puts, but i'd be more than glad to learn). 

Any advice is appreciated. If it happens that holding my money and waiting is the best option, I understand. however, I don't plan on putting much money at risk and I would love to learn what to do in this type of market.",

What is not a guarantee is what Carnival’s financial health will be by the time that rebound plays out. Even when everyone books, they can’t just take that money and pay off debt, they have to reserve it for refunds and to pay operating costs for future cruises. They missed basically an entire year of up front cash for advance bookings, which will take a while to catch up from.

Didn't have any clue about stocks, I lost around 100$ right away in stupid trades and commission fees. I started to learn slowly about, earnings, P/E radios, different sectors, indexes, some technical charter things ect. Now I'm still a noob, but have a much better picture of how stocks work. But this last month really killed me. I'm down -21% overall on my portfolio, I own mostly tech, renewable, and SPACs. Now I'm in a really confused place, 2-3 month ago during the tech all time high, I was reading how tech is the future, all those analysts giving price targets (example NIO, I saw a lot of price targets to 70-80$). I was reading how Palantir is the future of data analysis, and how it signing big contracts, I was reading how Biden will push renewables, and that renewables are the future, solar, fuel cells act.. Now over night, I'm reading how tech is overpriced, SPACs are in a bubble, you most rotate to value stocks, Palantir earnings are decreeaimg making bigger loses, workhorse is fake company, and lost a big contract. NIO is at a risk of being delisted because it's a Chinese company (like we didn't know this before), chip shortage will slow down the production ect..I feel like I'm being manipulated by all that news and lied. What should I do now, sell all my tech, renewable, and growth stocks and move my money to ""value""? Because, well.. tech is not the future anymore for some reason?

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

Bear Case: Niche retailer who took a large impairment charge in 2020 which took them to a sizable loss. Will face ever increasing competition from online mega giants, and they have a material debt overhang.

Bull case: Even the absolute worst retailers are trading at a 30%+ revenue multiple premium from JOAN’s current levels. Even at my absolute most bearish valuations, where they’d still be the cheapest retailer I can find in the market, there’s 8-10% easy upside. When you consider they’ve generally turned a profit, had been consistently growing revenue YOY, and it’s being reported will be offering a $.40 dividend this looks like it may be another CARR situation where there’s 100% upside just to normalize valuation.

mdkgaz,gs9zhpu,investing,comment,1616755452,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are pointing a bit higher as of 0635. Russell 2000 up 0.6% to lead the major indices. Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up 0.2%. Bonds are selling off, with the 10-year back up to 1.65%.

This follows a major reversal on Thursday. After opening lower, stocks rallied late in the day to book gains. Small caps led the charge there too, gaining 2.3%.

The whole thing looks like the virus on/virus off trade we saw most of last year. Each time markets resumed their rally. For the chartists out there, the 50-day moving average on the S&P has been the key support level.

Big picture: Things are just kind of quiet with lack of catalysts. Earnings season starts in a few weeks, which should provide some much needed context for how companies are dealing with the economic recovery. Expectations are pretty optimistic, which is partly what justifies the high valuations in many of these stocks.

Ultimately the economy is pointing in the right direction and monetary policy is ultra-loose. All things being equal, that usually results in money flowing into risk assets, ie stocks. Wouldn’t expect that equation to change.

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['SPGI', 'WFC', 'BLK']"

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.

But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic’s scarring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March. Data for the prior week was revised to show 11,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 730,000 applications for the latest week.",

mcpqqp,,investing,post,1616645951,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['TSLA', 'AAPL', 'TWTR', 'NDAQ']"

The companies has previously been run together with MSGS splitting MSGN off in 2015 and further splitting MSGE off this time last year. 

With MSGE and MSGN now merging back together. 

Conceptually it should allow MSGE, which is tangible asset rich but with bans still in effect on hosting events in their venues, to persist through until shows are back.

The combined company will also have more flexibility in pursuing sports betting avenues through both digital and at venue interfaces.

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

>  
>The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above. 

>An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

mcqwym,,investing,post,1616650283,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['INTC', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'QCOM']"

mc095v,,investing,post,1616572099,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably. Noting that MP (Mountian Pass) Mine is in California, we can assume they are doing their best to remain in compliance with a green energy future. MP NET INCOME Q4 2019: 1M MP NET INCOME Q4 2020: 24M

[March 4]    
>Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
>....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

My question is: what's the valuation and potential upside of LGL shares in this?",
mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['CRM', 'AMZN', 'NI', 'FB', 'GS', 'IP', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']"

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal *trial*s, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through *clinical* *develop*ment.""

""The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,"" said Robert Koenekoop, MD, MSc, PhD, FRCS(C), FARVO, a *clinical*\-scientist from the Montreal Children's Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surgery. ""Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients' biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal *trial* *develop*ment."" ",

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",

mbvs0e,gs1o9xi,investing,comment,1616592794,"~~Can you give the table number? Table 7 on pg 379 of the full prospectus is maybe what you’re looking at?~~

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']
mbvs0e,gs1qi8s,investing,comment,1616593860,"Honestly I don't understand it. What if you just bought a non-leveraged ETF with leverage. Let's say you are an individual investor and you get cheap margin or take out a loan on your real-estate etc and buy ETFs with that money. Surely this amplifies the return of the underlying and you don't need to worry about rebalancing yourself.

Now say instead of an individual investor, you pool together other investors and buy non-leveraged ETFs.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['JPM', 'ADI']"

mc8nea,,investing,post,1616599768,"Fluent (FLNT) - Highly volatile + Market Psychology play 

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

\- It has been recently (17.03.2021) **downgraded from 'Outperform' to 'Market Perform'** by Barrington Research, due to the slowdown in the growth for the fourth-quarter. The management claims that their decision ""... to limit its business to higher-quality advertising traffic..."" **may result in being beneficial in the long term** ([Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/why-fluent-stock-was-slammed-on-wednesday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)). Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

**Information worth noting;**

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

They also own a variety of other ventures including Wanlimu a   luxury consumer brand as well as 30% of Secoo with which they have a strategic partnership. Recently Qudian has invested in an early learning   education company (TAM $700B), as well as nearing completion on its   business park which will be completed this year.

Much like some other stocks was last year Qudian has been beaten to a pulp by the market. As of today (13/03/21) the company has a market cap of \~$490M. It’s shareholder equity? $1.655B. Yes, that’s not a typo this company has a price to asset ratio of 0.33. But now I hear you ask but what   about its earnings? In the three months to September 30 it made 87 million. Yuan? No, DOLLARS. Oh, and did I mention it has $219 million in cash?

The company has been through some tough times the last couple of years, with its regulatory   environment unstable and its earnings shrinking, that and its asset   quality decreased due to the rapid rise in delinquency rates during   COVID. I believe the company is turning the corner on this front,   however when you buy the stock you are not just buying a credit business, the CFO and CEO have stated they want to acquire companies   much in the same vein as Warren Buffet did with Berkshire Hathaway.

However   recently the CCP has stated that the next growth engine for China will not be an increase in factory capacity it will be from domestic consumption. What drives growth in an economy switching from production to consumption? Credit pure and simple. Qudian has outlasted a lot of   it’s competitors by tightening it’s lending policy, whilst this   conservative strategy has impacted it’s short term earnings it is now in   a place it in a position to capitalise on the new direction the government is taking on the economy.

They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I'd take this over a savings accnt anyday.

mb7dzn,grwejpc,investing,comment,1616478641,"LMT is about 10% of my portfolio and I have high hope for it, but there's really no guaranteed easy money. I initially bought at 370 and keep buying more and more on its way down to 320s, so now I just broke even.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['HD', 'NDAQ']"

Canadian Pacific is buying Kansas City Southern in a ~$25B deal - ~22% premium to Friday's closeKansas City Southern ($KSU) was the last class 1 railroad after the big 6 (BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific, and Canadian National) that had not yet been acquired or taken private. There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['NSC', 'KSU', 'CSX', 'UNP']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

I know this is a long post and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I don't really have a specific question, I would just like to hear any feedback (besides, your an idiot, and don't ever buy stocks again), advice, even similar stories.",

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

ma29dn,grsamuq,investing,comment,1616394655,"Perhaps my story can be instructive. I am 55 years old. I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above.",

That'll happen when you compare a global fund vs a US only fund and focus only on the US part of the US/ex-US cycle. I can almost certainly point to times where VTI would have been worse than IWDA.

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

m9dmdf,,investing,post,1616266670,"Financial Market PessimismFinancial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

Furthermore, taking a quick glance at their financial statements, marketing is by far the largest expense item on their P&L. A potential green flag is their marketing expenses are much lower for the T9Ms in FY20 vs FY19. But, has Management indicated they are going to cut back on that spending and think they are starting to get some stickiness in their user base? They managed to grow revenues soundly, despite spending less on marketing, which is why I'm curious what has changed in just 1 year, given these expenses increased over 50% from FY18 to FY19, while rev only grew 30%.","['EBAY', 'FB']"

Most Poshmark sellers sell their product through other marketplaces as well (ebay, mercari, grailed), that offer less fees for both seller and buyer.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",
m9adbw,,investing,post,1616257440,"Understanding China's economy & the embedded risks: This video has a surprisingly balanced and good take describing a lot of the risks and drivers of the Chinese economy.Watch the video here please [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg)

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

* Brazil
* India
* Russia
* China

The only one that is moving forward economically with much strength is China.  Those other three have fallen out of favor for a variety of means.  About 5 years ago, we we were seeing an exchange rate of 5.6 RMB to one USD.  Recently it's transposed digits to 6.5 RMB.  The same can be said of the Russian Ruble going from 56 to one USD, and now 74 to one USD.  

When your investments are analyzed and brought back, understand the FOREX component which can inflate (or deflate) your gains.  

The WSJ used to have an ""arbitrage"" portion in their paper to describe the cost of common goods like a cup of coffee or a BMW X5 (which was massive exported from the US market to the Chinese market for gain due to demand and currency price differences)  to let people know how much they're getting here, and abroad.",
m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",
m9adbw,grrytsx,investing,comment,1616385176,"Chinese politics aren't as one sided as folks might think.

- PBOC and other finance folks are the smart ones in the room.

- Military is filled with war mongers who don't understand economics. 

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0. US will fall back to Latin America for cheap labor, etc. 

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity. The island itself is worthless. You take Taiwan by force and you gain nothing but a small piece of land. Taiwanese will leave en masse.",

I didn't know about Ordos City the video talks about, so I googled it, turns out it's a city located in Inner Mongolia, which I know from my textbook back to high school, the extreme dry, windy weather and high latitude Plateau(ah, words might be redundant, but you got what I mean). I understand that the video might be true(as I said I didn't know the city, and I believe many Chinese don't know it either, and this is the point!), but it's biased to generalize the whole country, then talk about the economics of the whole giant China(financially, it's a complex, multi-dimensional system after all), this doesn't make sense to me, anyway, this is not the first time political motivated... But, seriously, people living in this side of the world(mainly America and Europe) should at least understand how big geographically china is, and why the northern west part of China is less developed.  Mostly, minorities live there with their own languages, majority people from southern/northern east part of China where full of mountains and rivers won't choose the live there, while all the youtubers like to take this special rare sample as prove base to show the world what China is like and will be, tbh, seeing modern houses/apartments building there is actually encouraging.

Like I said, I didn't know this city, but I do know a famous singer who is from Inner Mongolia, like many others coming to southern/Northern East of China for their career, seeking opportunities, making their stories known to everyday Chinese people like me. So we know how hard it is living there, and the government is promoting/making policies that keep encouraging us fresh graduates/investors to go there help the local economics by bringing the tourism, donation, building house, utilizing the wind resources for electricity generation and teaching/educating homeless kids/orphans there etc..  Of course their lives are getting better, and still because they are minorities, the weather is just not suitable for living  in long term, not many people would like to move to live there.

With that knowledge in mind, let's come back to the video and reviews, it just makes no sense to make any conclusions/judgments about the whole Chinese economics based on those rare less developing cities while they are improving, but people buying whatever those youtubers feed to their reviewers. I'm making this comment to pint it out, as I saw so many posts and videos use this same strategy to get the attention especially on YouTube, generating revenues for themselves, while brainwashing people who don't know about China, just keep it in mind, be open and the so called democracy is defined differently in different minds of people, although we all use the same word ""democracy""!

Please don't attack me or call me CCP bot whatever, it will hurts me, makes me sad, because I'm a legit human, I have feelings, I'm just here to provide you more information. All those hates and conspiracies are from misunderstanding, and I don't like to argue with people, always choose to be positive.",

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

m8o362,,investing,post,1616179606,"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )  

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m8o362,grjfujb,investing,comment,1616198653,"I live in Colombia and there are some key points worth knowing before entering this move:

1. **The regulation is volatile.** The government party does not support completely medicinal cannabis. President only supported it with the condition on being more strict on licenses (benefiting big producers as Clever) because his hated predecesor had a more progressive agenda on cannabis. Two years ago there were rumors about an official request looking for a reduction in our global quota. Never happened.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['PGR', 'UPS']"
m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

No debt

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers.

m8ugyr,grmpuy8,investing,comment,1616274792,"I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

It also appears they may not be able to meet upcoming long term debt covenants. It requires Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of below 5.5x by June. To me, they’re not going to meet this.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway. 

I don’t think theatres will be able to operate back at normal capacity for years with the move to streaming platforms and lack of big blockbuster productions during the pandemic year. It’ll be a steep uphill climb ... or a drop off the cliff.",

&#x200B;

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance. This ruling may have a significant impact on funds and investments classified under ESG and socially responsible investing.""

Were participants in these retirement plans not given the option to opt out of ESG investing? or are they now not being given the option to opt in?

However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

The recent sell-off in clean energy was a needed correction, but companies like Novonix will be severely undervalued soon in being that they are working to support the growing demand for Lithium-ion technology and the resources to support it.

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too.

Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between [Visa](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE) and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?   


Supporting this idea, [Apple](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ) is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, [Facebook](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FB:NASDAQ?window=1Y) is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak.   


What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech?

Seeing as I'm no millionaire this will be one of the few times I'm able to particiapte. I belive in their business model bigly and honestly think they have a very good chance of succeeding.

Up until now I've only invested in stocks and mutual funds so when it comes to investing in privately-held companies what pitfalls and financial key metrics should I look at / ask them?

The company today:

* Current outstanding shares: 6m
* Implied equity value: 23m USD

They are about to initiate another round of funding, this will be a large round where they are trying to raise 440m USD since they are scaling up substatntionally from local to national distribution and sales in order to supply demand , if sucessfull it will change the numbers to:

* Outstanding shares: 15.5m
* Estimated valuation: 440m USD

Estimated earnings/projections look good but what specific answers should I ask them before jumping the gun and what key metrics should I try and calculate?",

The second question you should be asking yourself is what is the available market and what chance do they have of capturing enough to justify the valuation. By 'm' I assume you mean million, not thousand. 440 million isnt exactly chump change. Plenty of public companies are valued lower. 

The third question you should be asking yourself is what is the exit plan. Going public? Acquisition? Selling your shares back? Profit sharing? 

Beyond that, you need to see audited books, projected sales, general business plan etc. You need counsel and accounting. Do these shares come with voting rights? Are you already under NDA? How easily can the product and/or business model be copied and improved upon? What have they identified as gaps? Have they had an independent consultant come in and what gaps did their report indicate?

Are you throwing f u money at a friend because you have a gut feeling or are you actually looking to invest? Because you turned to a serious investing subreddit I have an inclination it's the latter. You need to provide way more info to get more direct answers.",

But what people forget is you also don’t want to buy long-duration equities,” Bernstein, CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC’s “[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/)” on Wednesday. “What’s a long-duration equity? Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

I wonder if he had anything to say about oil last year when prices were depressed. I bought XOM and PSX between Aug and Oct on the way down as they were going towards March lows and the forecast was that they would only improve post-Covid which everyone was guessing would be sometime this year.

Greetings

**The narrative**

1. Chinese   energy production by source: Coal 58% Petro 20% Hydro 8% LNG 8%   Renewable 5%  Nuclear 2%. Renewables have had an amazing 10 years with   explosive growth, Liquids and Nuclear growth is more modest but Nuclear   curve is steeper. The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)
2. Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal. "" full  article [here](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210312A0AAON00)
2. The  stock is slightly overvalued and I have a hard time comparing it to  other stocks or indexes. (data source yahoo finance)Trailing P/E 	16.15   Price/Sales (ttm)	1.94  Price/Book (mrq)	1.46  Enterprise Value/Revenue  7.28  Enterprise Value/EBITDA  11.38

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?  


My  background: New to the channel and to reddit, I was brought here by  crypto.I  am looking into subject company, considering that the net-0  emissions  targets are only possible by nuclear energy. I have always  admired the clean and cheap features of nuclear energy, I always  supported it and I anticipate it's golden era.Now, on investing, I would  like your take on  this company, and to initiate discussions which will  circle knowledge  through.Bear in mind that there are some restrictions  to investing in  this company if you are an American at the time of  writing.Last, I  want to avoid the trap of replicating the returns i got  from crypto. My  thinking is long term >5 years and I give weight  both on the  narrative and on fundamentals.",

I think its overvalued because of the shit show that is nuclear power here, especially for a beijing based company. Utilities here are hooooooooooooooooorribly run, with nuclear being only slightly better than hydro electric.

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

*95% of the time, you’re underwater. The less you look, the better off you’ll be.*

**2. The Dow has compounded at less than 3 basis points a day since 1970. Since then it’s up more than 3,000%.**  
*Compounding really is magic.*

**3. The Dow has only been positive 52% of all days. The average daily return is 0.73% when it’s up and -0.76% when it’s down.**  
*See above.*

**4. The Dow has spent more time 40% or more below the highs than within 2% of the highs (20.6% of days vs. 18.4% of days)**  
*No pain, no gain.*

**5. The Dow gained 38 points in the 1970s**  
*See above.*

**6. Why am I using the Dow instead of the S&P 500? They’re effectively the same thing. The rolling one-year correlation since 1970 is .95.**  
*Stop wasting your time on this.*

**7. At the low in 2009, U.S. stocks were back to where they were in 1996.**  
*Stocks for the long-run. The very long-run. Usually. Sometimes.*

**8. At the low in 2009, Japanese stocks were back to where they were in 1980.**  
*See above.*

**9. U.S. one-month Treasury bills went 68 years with a negative real return.**  
*What’s safe in the short-run can be risky in the long-run.*

**10. At the bottom in 2009, long-term U.S. government bonds outperformed the stock market over the previous 40 years**  
*Stocks generally outperform bonds, but there are no guarantees.*

**11. Gold and the Dow were both 800 in 1980. Today Gold is $1,700/ounce. The Dow is near 32k.**  
*Cash flows > commodities.*

**12. Over the last twenty years, Gold is up 340%. Stocks are up 208%, with dividends.**  
*You can support any argument by changing the start and end dates.*

**13. Since 1980, Gold is up 153%. Inflation is up 230%.**  
*See above.*

**14.** [**CTAs**](https://portal.barclayhedge.com/cgi-bin/indices/displayCtaIndex.cgi?indexCat=Barclay-CTA-Indices&indexName=Barclay-CTA-Index) **gained 14% in 2008 when stocks lost 37%. Since 2009 they’re up 2.5%. Stocks are up 282%.**  
*Non-correlation cuts both ways.*

**15. If you had invested from 1960-1980 and beaten the market by 5% each year, you would have made less money than if you had invested from 1980-2000 and underperformed the market by 5% a year**   
*When you were born > almost everything else.*

**16. The Dow lost 17% in 1929, 34% in 1930, 53% in 1931 and 23% in 1932.**

*The stock market ≠ the economy.*

**20. In 1949, the stock market was trading at 6.8x earnings and had a 7.5% dividend yield. 50 years later, it reached a high of 30x earnings and carried just a 1% dividend yield.**

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much, it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grd5s0u,investing,comment,1616078801,Incredible.  I already posted this below your original post: it reads like the script for a Netflix docuseries.,['NFLX']
m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat. 

Looking forward to seeing the stock price go to less than a $1.",['TWTR']

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['EBAY', 'ETSY', 'AMZN', 'PYPL']"

It's a sinking ship currently, and they need a really big idea to plug a lot of holes. 

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['EBAY', 'FB', 'AMZN']"

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

With the massive influx of people into ""reddit investing"" I assume a significant percentage to be novice (I'm trying to keep it polite). 

That being said, the less sophisticated the  investor, the more likely they would be to act ""later"" and with less regard to risk and volatility. And yet I believed they WOULD act. 

I really feel as if the last 2 months has created a FOMO phenomenon and that there is significant, traditionally irrational buying. 

I just could not figure out a way to quantify and then be able to act on it. 

You've taken my simple idea and added a brain to it.

Thank you for sharing this!

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

(Market cap calculations used for 50 years out is multiplying by 29.45, which is 1.07^50)",['SPGI']

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings.

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['ED', 'PWR']"

I do NOT want this in any way, shape or form to turn into a Political Debate. But the fact is there is a new Presidential Administration in power and the differences between this administration and the last are so far beyond “night and day” that I’m not even going to attempt an accurate comparison. 

As we all know, the stock market hates uncertainty, and because this is the first year of a new administration there is more uncertainty. I expect the $DIA and $SPY to trade mostly sideways until Q4, when there should be much less uncertainty. If you want massive gains in $DIA and $SPY names, you are going to have to get your hands dirty and identify deep value. $QQQ names will naturally be more volatile given current growth multiples.

First things first, Europe has enacted severe Covid restrictions in the face of the new Corona variants. This naturally causes concern that other countries may have to follow suit, including the US. I personally think there is ZERO chance of new, severe lockdowns here, as we have higher vaccination rates than the European countries. \[[https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249). \]([https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249))

If you regularly scan the SEC and other government websites, ESG has been well telegraphed: \[[https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf)\]([https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf)), \[[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20)\]([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20)), \[[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42)\]([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42)), and \[[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52)\]([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52)) are a few important examples.

But it’s not just the SEC that will be enacting new rules and regulations for corporations, the FTC is also gearing up because, again, there is a new sheriff in town: \[[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group)\]([https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group)).

Additionally, there is a lot of talk about new taxes on corporations and on the ultra wealthy. This causes more uncertainty and makes corporations and individuals take pause and act more slowly and cautiously. \[[https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years)\]([https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years)) 

You have to remember that especially $DIA and $SPY names, large corporations are almost always slow to react and corporate Boards are hesitant to act when there is a lot of potential regulatory and tax rate uncertainty on the horizon. Interestingly, I expect $QQQ names to embrace and comply with any new ESG regulations more quickly than any $DIA and $SPY names, so look for FAANG type-companies to act first, loudly and perfectly in step with the new Administration.

TL;DR: A host of regulatory and tax changes are coming. This creates uncertainty and the stock market hates uncertainty. IMHO this is an important factor in recent stock market movements that have been overlooked on reddit.",
mdrbd7,gsaxu9g,StockMarket,comment,1616773885,"I was kinda wondering if it was dip buyers from a year ago waiting for the lower taxation rate for LONG sales, coupled with the need to pay taxes for this year.",
mdrbd7,gsayuo4,StockMarket,comment,1616774324,"This is absolutely not what is going on with prices.

The only rules they're talking about regarding ESG is to set standards about how companies report ESG risks to investors. That's it. But they're already required to report things that they know of that will affect stock prices, so this is a very small, marginal thing, that will affect a small number of companies per year. Perhaps it will lead to better reporting of major scandals. Perhaps. But investors are not trading on the assumption that all these companies have major scandals about to break

Remember also, when the election happened, stocks went up, because the business community knew the we needed a period of higher taxes to build infrastructure. These tax changes are already priced in; there is nothing new about this plan, it is the anticipated plan. That always means it was already priced in. It isn't news.👼",

mdjp65,,StockMarket,post,1616745919,"Question: Why is everyone (seemingly) bearish on oil?Sorry, I’m somewhat new to this and I think I must be missing something here. I do get that we are in the early stages of a green revolution but it’s definitely still early days for that.

I have seen a lot of posts of people claiming that they are avoiding oil completely. What I don’t understand though is why? And I mean aside from moral reasons.

If your goal is to make money, how is this something to avoid?

I can see that electric cars are slowly becoming cool and people are pushing for wind power and all that stuff. But when I look into the facts a lot of that tech is still further out than people believe.

I read an article stating that the current electrical grid couldn’t actually sustain that many electric vehicles. I read an article stating that it could take decades if not centuries for those types of technologies to be fully adopted.

I would even go so far as to question whether an electric car with parts made of plastic actually counts as green. We use oil for a lot more than just vehicles too. From cosmetics through to medicine. Clothing, shoes, building materials (coating) the list goes on.

In addition with the cost of living people are commuting further and further to work because if you don’t live in a major city you probably don’t live close to work. And if you do, you’re quite possibly a barista living with 7 people in a 3 bedroom apartment.

I remember there was a popular documentary on Netflix and I totally forget what it was called. But they were talking about the possibility of oil resources dwindling.

Of course politicians are saying they will cut carbon emissions because that’s what people want to hear. But they’ve been saying this for as long as I’ve been alive and I haven’t seen any real change.

And what about other countries? There are places in China where people still use coal to heat their damn houses. They aren’t all about to hop into their Tesla’s. They’re going to commute on busses or pile 7 people in the same car.

So in short, please correct me if I’m wrong here, the need for oil isn’t going anywhere any time soon. In addition there are going to be further supply problems and shortages.

Essentially, I just see a continued need and a bunch of factors that will drive the price of oil up. Especially in the long run. Yeah, don’t get me wrong, I really hope we can turn the world green and I would love to be able to breathe fresh air in my city like I could during lockdown when no one was driving. 

In addition I can’t resist saying that I feel a million times safer with a billion cars on the road than I would with a nuclear power plant next door. Remember Fukushima? It’s STILL leaking radiation into the ocean. So I hope when we go green we don’t take the dangerous nuclear route.

I’m all for green technology and a healthier planet. Sadly, though, I still feel like there is a lot of money to be made in oil and there is still a need that isn’t going to just disappear. So I might as well turn a profit.

But I am seeing a lot of people saying that they are avoiding oil completely and wouldn’t touch it with a 100 foot pole.

My question to them is, aside from moral reasons, why? Am I missing something here? Is it somehow a risky investment?","['TSLA', 'NFLX']"

md8ofw,,StockMarket,post,1616707055,"Just because a stock you buy is in a company that will be successful does not mean you will make a profitI am by no means an experienced investor but I've seen a lot of rationale behind buying some stocks like TSLA, PYPL, PLTR, etc. as, ""I believe in the company long term"". To be fair that is a good starting point and you should believe in the vast majority of your investments long term. However, just because a company could be very successful in 10/15/20 years down the line doesn't guarantee a profit for you because you bought shares years before that.

An example I will use is TSLA. Now I love their products and am fully behind the mission of the company. I myself have a Model 3 and I believe it is years ahead of any other car I've driven. Add on to that their solar and battery technologies and I can't help but believe that TSLA will absolutely be a successful and profitable company. However, if you bought TSLA recently you most likely bought at around a P/E of 1000. You are essentially paying 1000x earnings. Or in other words you are expecting TSLA to reach $690 million (2020 net profit) * 1000 = $690 billion in net profit. I want to emphasize you are already paying for that expectation today. In other words, for you to make a substantial profit, expectations around future earnings need to move even farther past this number. If competition changes the growth prospects for TSLA or they run into manufacturing trouble or anything else causes people to shift their expectations on TSLA achieving $690 billion in earnings the stock will most likely drop.

As a company TSLA may continue on profiting and being a very successful car manufacturer however, that does not mean your stock will keep going up just because their profit grows. Even if profit is increasing at a healthy rate.

Now, I'm not posting this to be bearish on TSLA or anything I just wanted to bring up the idea that just because a company will be successful doesn't mean they are a good investment. I know P/E isn't everything and especially when it comes to growth stocks a high P/E isn't necessarily bad I just thought it would be a good jumping off point to help conceptualize the price.I think way too many people are comfortably putting money in what I see as very high risk investments and simply defending their position with ""I believe in the company long term"" without even considering what the company will have to look like and achieve long term to get to the valuation that they bought in at.","['TSLA', 'PYPL']"

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-friday-march-26.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

> * Dow and S&P 500 futures Friday added to Thursday’s late-session comeback, which saw Wall Street break a two-day losing streak, putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 at about breakeven for the week. The Dow closed up 199 points, boosted by economic comeback stocks, after losing as much as 348 points earlier Thursday. Nasdaq futures turned lower Friday after the index closed slightly higher. However, it remained 1.8% lower for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up Friday but still below recent 14-month highs.

> * The Commerce Department is out with personal income and spending figures for February at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect an income drop of 7%. Spending is also seen dropping by 0.8%. In January, income jumped 10%, its biggest monthly gain since April, as Americans received stimulus checks approved in December. Spending in January increased by 2.4%. In the coming months, another round of stimulus checks, approved in March, could start showing up in the data.

*****

> # 2. Office-sharing company WeWork signs new deal to go public

> * WeWork, which pulled its IPO in 2019 after a dwindling valuation and resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann, has reached a new deal to go public. The office-sharing company agreed on Friday to merge with special purpose acquisition company BowX Acquisition Corp. The transaction values WeWork at $9 billion, a fraction of its one-time valuation of around $47 billion. Following the announcement, shares of BowX rose 2.5% in Friday premarket.

*****

> # 3. GameStop shares to open higher after soaring over 50%

> * GameStop shares jumped roughly 10% in Friday’s premarket, the morning after snapping a five-session losing streak and closing 52% higher. There was no apparent news Thursday. GameStop has been the most high-profile “meme stock,” popular among retail traders on Reddit and other social media platforms. The stock lost about a third of its value Wednesday after the video game retailer delivered disappointing fourth-quarter results, failed to give in-depth detail about its digital turnaround plans, and acknowledged it’s considering selling more stock.

*****

> # 4. Tesla ordered to have Elon Musk delete anti-union tweet

> * The National Labor Relations Board told Tesla to make Elon Musk delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers within the company. The independent federal agency also ordered Tesla to reinstate a fired employee, Richard Ortiz, a union advocate. Tesla must also compensate Ortiz for loss of earnings, benefits and adverse tax consequences that resulted from his termination. The NLRB decision was largely in line with an administrative law judge’s ruling from 2019, which Tesla had appealed to the full board.

*****

> # 5. Suez Canal blockage delays estimated $400 million an hour in goods

> * The Ever Given, a stranded mega container ship in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million per hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that move through the key waterway every day. That’s according to shipping data and news company Lloyd’s List. Lloyd’s values the canal’s westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world.

Like most people, I started out on Robinhood, but after that debacle, my friends and I decided to switch brokerages. They found Webull, and since then I have been using Webull. However, it has come to my attention that Webull surprisingly doesn’t allow trailing stop losses. Well, they *do* but they’re only GFD and not GTC. Personally I think that’s absurd. I frequently invest in growth stocks and although I am very confident in my dd, it bothers me that I can’t have that added layer of protection because after all, the market is unpredictable and emotional. So I would like to switch from Webull, but I have no idea where to go from here. Any ideas for the best brokerage for me? I need GTC trailing stop losses, fundamental analysis tools like market cap, p/e, p/b, free float market cap, etc. Also, I need technical analysis so the ability to look at charts in real time (it just interests me) with the ability to customize my indicators. Lastly, I need the ability to do covered calls and options. In the end, I am looking for a good UI that’s clean (similar to RH). Am I asking for too much? Does this brokerage even exist?

mdj8tq,,StockMarket,post,1616743862,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity. Note, I have links to news articles covering both issues below.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

Hey guys, I made a video of my DD on EEENF. Imo, this could be one of the next big runners. There’s currently alot of hype surrounding this stock, check out my video here: https://youtu.be/gGKMpp5HVt8

Here’s the written DD version:

https://88energy.com/about-us/strategy/[https://88energy.com/about-us/strategy/](https://88energy.com/about-us/strategy/)

So let’s talk about what this company does, if we go to there about page, they state that The company’s goal is to build a successful exploration and production company that delivers material benefits to its shareholders and contributes to the development of the regions in which it works.

https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/88E/02343638.pdf[https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/88E/02343638.pdf](https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/88E/02343638.pdf)

Currently there’s 12 billion shares and each share is currently trading at 1.4 cents at the time of this video, which means it has a relatively small market cap still at only 168mil and could grow relative to its massive catalyst.

https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02352252-6A1024039?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4[https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02352252-6A1024039?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02352252-6A1024039?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)

So this is the huge catalyst that I’m really thinking is going to make this stock absolutely explode. They just released this on March 11 which is basically an update on their operations. To summarize, they’ll be commencing their drilling into the Merlin-1 well at a cost of $4 million which is fine since they currently have $13 million in cash, so they’ll be able to finish this project for sure. They’ll be expecting the results from this operation within the next 4 weeks.

However, if we scroll down to page 2, we see that their total prospects for 3 of their wells is 1.6 billion barrels of oil. Currently, one barrel of oil is worth approximately $50-$60. I don’t know what their margins are for each barrel of oil, but if they were only making $1 off each barrel, they’d rack in $1.6 billion assuming they’re able to extract all the oil from these wells. So the upside is theoretically massive, but the risk is that they won’t be able to extract that much, and that they might not be as profitable as we expect, but still, if they’re only able to mine 1/10th of what their prospects are, I think it’d still be a really good investment. 

I think there might be alot of FOMO going on right now, since alot of people are trying to buy this stock and ride the wave, so just be careful if you see massive jumps of like 100-200% I’m not sure if it’d be worth buying and you could get burnt pretty badly, but I think this may be a pretty good play just due to the massive catalyst that’s going on right now. Anyways, that’s going to be it for today’s video, I’ll catch you guys in the next one.

mdrq70,,StockMarket,post,1616774132,SoFi to give amateur investors early access to IPOs in break from Wall Street tradition,
mdrq70,gsayi45,StockMarket,comment,1616774172," Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street’s institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don’t have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

“Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn’t have before,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. “It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.”

 SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It’s common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don’t typically offer them to the everyday investor. 

 Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter’s debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO “based on the access they get to that unique product,” he said.

“Individual investors don’t generate those types of revenues, therefore they don’t get access to the unique product,” Noto said. “The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.”

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a “reservation.” The app will alert them when it’s time to confirm an order.

Trading app Robinhood [is working on a similar platform](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/robinhood-building-platform-to-allow-users-to-buy-into-ipos-sources-say.html) to offer access to initial public offerings, including its own upcoming debut, according to Reuters. Robinhood declined to comment.

SoFi is set to go public by merging with a blank-check company run by venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya. The merger with [Social Capital Hedosophia Corp V](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IPOE%5E) valued SoFi at $8.65 billion. The company was founded in 2011 with a focus on student loan refinancing for millennials and now offers stock and cryptocurrency trading, personal and mortgage loans and wealth management services.

SoFi’s IPO product comes on the heels of record levels of new, younger traders entering the stock market during the pandemic. That surge has continued into 2021, marked by frenzied trading around so-called meme stocks like GameStop.

Noto said less than 1% of SoFi accounts are “active traders” that trade more than three times per day and the company has held off on offering margin or options trading. Still, he acknowledged the current risk appetite of some retail investors and the dangers of diving into new, unproven companies as they go public.

“Investing early is inherently ... risky, and those are less-proven companies,” Noto said. “In the same way as cryptocurrency, we disclose to people that these come with a higher degree of risk.”",['TWTR']

An account on Twitter @Capital__Gainz that was very early on $TKAT and $IMTE before they 🚀. He reached out to another company $CRTD and they confirmed that they will be addressing NTF’s at their next earnings call on the 31st of March. None of the large Twitter accounts have tweeted about this yet, they are reaching out to the company to confirm. If you don’t trust the email, you can email their investor relations and get confirmation yourself. The stock has only about 1300 followers on stocktwits, it’s still relatively undiscovered. If NTF speculation is confirmed, a low float and a fairly large short interest should make for a pretty good short squeeze. This would also be coupled with the massive push that NTF stocks are experiencing recently. This isn’t financial advice. I’m just saying to look into it.

Stocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet another volatile trading session. Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. 

In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency."" This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. 

However, despite Powell’s consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, “This will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it’ll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they’re most needed.” 

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

We agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, [insisting the vaccine was “strongly effective” against the virus. ](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d)

mdf2dx,,StockMarket,post,1616727086,"($OGI) Organigram —> Cannabis Backed by Big TobaccoOn March 11th, 2021 British American Tobacco ($BAT) [announced](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/tobacco-giant-takes-20-stake-in-organigram-for-c221-million/) a 19.9% stake in Organigram ($OGI) by buying 58.3 million common shares at a price of CA$3.792, based on a five-day average price on the Toronto Stock Exchange, portending similar tie-ups with US cannabis firms.

>Organigram believes BAT’s investment and the PDC will benefit the Company as follows:

* *Accelerates and strengthens Organigram’s R&D and product development activities, including granting access to certain BAT-owned IP. The Center of Excellence provides Organigram the opportunity to closely collaborate with BAT, a leading global consumer business with extensive expertise and experience in R&D, on the development of innovative and differentiated cannabis products, IP and technologies. The significant injection of capital from BAT also enables Organigram to further invest in its own R&D and product development activities. In addition, Organigram will gain access to certain BAT IP for the purpose of undertaking R&D activities under the PDC Agreement.*
* *Raises significant capital to invest in growth opportunities, including entering the United States and other international markets. With the significant capital injection, Organigram is even better positioned to expand into the U.S. and further international markets at the appropriate time and subject to applicable law. Upon closing, Organigram will have pro-forma cash and short-term investments of approximately C$296 million (of which approximately C$30 million will be reserved in order to satisfy certain of Organigram’s obligations under the PDC Agreement and the balance of which can be used, among other things, for growth opportunities and other strategic investments including advancing Organigram’s international strategy). Under the PDC Agreement, the Company will be granted a worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable, perpetual license to exploit IP developed under the PDC in any field. This license which is non-exclusive outside of Canada and sole in Canada will also enhance Organigram’s ability to enter markets outside of Canada, including through sublicensing arrangements with established operators.*
* *Allows Organigram to leverage BAT’s expertise for its wider operations through the Centre of Excellence and BAT’s representation on Organigram’s Board of Directors (“Board”). BAT is a leading consumer goods business with tremendous expertise and experience accumulated over more than a century in research and development and product innovation. Organigram will be provided direct access to BAT’s expertise through the Center of Excellence staff seconded from BAT (including members of the steering committee which will oversee the Center of Excellence, as well as a group of scientists, researchers, and product developers).*

**TERMS**

Contemporaneously with the closing, Organigram and BAT entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) providing BAT with certain rights including its right to participate in equity issuances to maintain its percentage shareholding, subject to customary exceptions, and periodic top-up rights to permit maintenance of its percentage ownership following exempt issuances.

The Investor Rights Agreement also includes customary pro rata piggy-back registration rights in favour of BAT, and certain share transfer restrictions for BAT’s shareholding interests in OGI.

The tobacco giant is taking a nearly 20% stake in Organigram – valued at 220 million Canadian dollars ($175 million) – and the two companies will develop the core intellectual property to be used for product development.

**Center of Excellence**

>“Both parties contribute background IP to the agreement, and all of the IP developed through the Center of Excellence will be registered under ownership by BAT. (Under their deal, the companies agreed to create a Center of Excellence to partner on product development, with an initial focus on CBD.); But we receive a global royalty-free perpetual license. It made sense for one party to manage that, said Organigram CEO, Greg Engel

The way the deal is structured, each company is free to commercialize products in any market globally.

>We both look at it from the perspective of creating the strongest products first, and the way we come to market would be very different in different markets and segments. In the near term in Canada with THC-based products, we’d be sooner to market than they would. You’re creating **IP**. You may further that IP and come up with a somewhat different product, but at the end of the day, you each have your independent brands and you’d each be independently marketing the products.

In the case of BAT and Organigram, both companies will contribute background intellectual property to the research and development process at the Center of Excellence.

*“And all of the IP developed through the Center of Excellence will be registered under ownership by BAT, but we receive a global royalty-free perpetual license. It made sense for one party to manage that,”* Organigram CEO Greg Engel said in a phone interview with MJBizDaily.

The shared IP would essentially be the foundation for products that could evolve in different ways for the respective businesses, depending on a variety of factors.

Engel is not worried about the two companies potentially competing against each other with the IP they develop together.

Some of the timing will depend on:

1. The products as they’re developed.
2. The timing of the regulations, depending on which market segment we’re entering and which jurisdiction we’re in.

>Pursuant to the PDC Agreement, Organigram and BAT have agreed to jointly develop cannabis vapor products, cannabis oral products and any other products, IP or technologies the parties mutually agree to develop. BAT will own all IP developed under this collaboration and will grant to Organigram a royalty-free, perpetual, global license to all such IP. Each party has also agreed to grant to the other a non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to certain existing IP of such party and its affiliates for purposes of conducting the development activities and exploiting the products, technologies and IP created by the Centre of Excellence pursuant to the PDC Agreement, subject to certain restrictions.

**Board Representation**

BAT’s board representation rights under the Investor Rights Agreement, entitle BAT to appoint (i) 20% of the Board for so long as it holds at least 15% of the issued and outstanding common shares in OGI from time to time and (ii) 10% of the Board so long as BAT holds at least 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Organigram from time to time.

**Technicals/Conclusion**

Organigram presents a unique opportunity for those interested in exposure in cannabis & a potential play on US legalization of cannabis.

Interesting play here, imo.. currently sitting at 50/50 on all charts, not oversold - not overbought.

Potential C&H pattern forming on the yearly. (handle looks like a beautiful bullflag, check out the 6mo)

Very strong support \~3.24 usd (closed @ 3.66usd) with a gap closed from early March (BAT collab). As price consolidation comes to an end, NOW would be a solid buying opportunity **in my opinion**

Initial PT —> 4.5usd (w/ buystops @ 4.8)

PT —> 7usd (3-5months)

Eyeing $4 9/17/21 Cs @ 1.00

The increased opportunity also caused the analysts, Rahul Sarugaser and Michael W. Freeman at Raymond James, to double their price target for its stock to $6 per share Canadian ($4.78).

>Sarugaser and Freeman are looking for Organigram's revenue to significantly expand over the next few years, hitting almost $87 million this year, $92 million next year, and surging fivefold by 2025 to reach $584 million. That sort of acceleration should help Organigram's share of the adult-use cannabis market in Canada to nearly double to 12.5% from its current 6.5%.

I searched for what info I could find and im still new so bear  with me lol.

Their revenue has increased year over year 13.55 percent for 2020.
However they still betged a 47.88 million loss last year.

The second hand resale is supposed to.increase to anywhere from 51 billion to 64 billion market in the next 4 to 5 years.
There were various different articles/reports I read on this hence the 10 billion or so spread.
With the Gen Z and Millennial fueling much of that growth.

And this I'd just my experience but I work with a lot of younger generation and I hear and see them buying second hand resale more so than new.
I also have quite a few friends who do so as well.

If they go public around the expected 12-14 dollar mark I may take a position.

Edit: I saw on their actual website the resale market to grow to 36 billion by 2024 which is lower than what I stated above.",

Good morning Traders, I spy a short squeeze... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things...[Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 3 26 21](https://youtu.be/qxDjfigz5k4) 

📷

I Spy a short squeeze...yep here we go with the pain trade. The line in the sand has been drawn by the bears, if the bulls can break thru it there could be a nice pop up. If not, we’re going down. I Have been looking for a true Trend day structure and it hasn’t quite happened. The line in the sand is 391 if we break thru that area it opens up a path to 393-395. Keep in mind the market makers expected move to the up side is 396.8 and 382 to the down side, there is a high probability we test one of those areas. However, beware of a wall of rejection being built at the 391 area, enough rejection could send us reeling down to 389 and below. Where internals open will be important, we open up at extreme highs and trail off lower we tread water for a bit before falling.  Internals open in the middle or at lows it may give the market enough strength to break thru the line in the sand. Let's look at the possible outcomes for the day: 1) We retest the 391-area resistance fail then consolidate between 391 and 389 area before breaking out. 2) trend day up structure, we maintain an opening gap up from yesterday’s close (389.65). In the first 30 min we get a try at filling the gap but hold above 389.65 then we go up breaking thru 391 area with a target of 393-396 area. 3) we test and break below 389 area. Look for retest of 391 to short.  

1) We retest the 391-area resistance fail then consolidate between 391 and 389 area before breaking out. **39% probability** 

2) trend day up or rounded reversal structure, we maintain an opening gap up from yesterday’s close (389.65). In the first 30 min we get a try at filling the gap but hold above 389.65 then we go up breaking thru 391 area with a target of 393-396 area. **41% probability**

mdbk8e,,StockMarket,post,1616715523,"RVP 25% shortedCheck on RVP (Retractable technologies), USA’s very own safety syringe making company which got 58mil$ contract from US Govt for delivering syringes for covid vaccination. 

It touched 21.50$ on feb 1st since they are exceeding their revenue snd EPS, and March 31st is their next earnings call (Apr 16th as per RH), and they r beating their revenue again by new deals.  

But it didn’t make any sense why it tanked to 10.96$ today till I saw shorts interest at a whopping 24.99% and it all made sense now. Hedge Funds are playing with retail investors hard earned money and bringing it down and we are helpless against them.

Don’t take my word for it, do your own research and due diligence and decide for yourself whether this is a good stock or not, and decide whether this Us company deserves to be tanked or deserves to fly high 🚀🚀🚀 

If the stock value goes beyond 25$ then take your cautious approach whether to invest or not, but below 20$ it’s still a great bet since it was at 21.50$ a month back and they have exceeded their revenues.  If there is a short squeeze then this $RVP deserves to be on top- since you will not loose money like other stocks because IMO it has great potentials not to fail, and with the medical syringes in great demand - this company will sky rocket if it survives this shorting attempt by Hedge funds...

Plz do your own research on this and decide for yourself and my be admin can take a not on this if this company along with PLTR , STPk etc deserves to be get noticed or not... A 5 min research won’t hurt anyone to check the facts on my words 👍",

mdbk8e,gs8fn4x,StockMarket,comment,1616716058,"This is as per my research. Please check with someone who knows about stocks and financials etc before you invest, as I did, and decide for yourself. I don’t want to mislead anyone just because I bought these stocks, but since I believed in bis company and I believe that without HF shorting -this is worth more than 22-25$ by March 31st or Apr 16 (as per RH eps dates). But after the earnings report it may slide down a bit (so take your profits a bit that time or before to safeguard your investment), and you can reinvest again. But, remember stock market is volatile and hedges always play around and manipulate the stock value for their personal gains. So do keep an eye on it always.

All the best 🚀🚀🚀",

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI Inc. is a medical technology company driven to transform cancer surgery with advanced, real-time, ultra-high-resolution imaging tools to address areas of high unmet medical need.

Perimeter’s ticker symbol “PINK” is a reference to the pink ribbons used during Breast Cancer Awareness Month by the Canadian Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society, driving home the company’s dedication to helping surgeons, radiologists and pathologists use Perimeter’s imaging technology and AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the fight against breast cancer, which is estimated to account for 30% of all female cancer diagnoses this year.

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI is transforming the specimen imaging landscape with its advanced in-procedural medical imaging tools designed to provide clinicians with real-time, ultra-high resolution, sub-surface image volumes across the surface of an excised tissue specimen. We are passionate about providing real time information that will allow clinicians to dramatically improve care while reducing healthcare costs.

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI Inc. is currently working towards getting 510K approval so that they can officially enter the commercialization stage and make their first sale. That is expected to happen in the first quarter of 2021

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI is developing innovative imaging technology embedded with AI to scan excised breast tissue in minutes in the OR with the goal of preventing additional surgeries.

mdbqoq,,StockMarket,post,1616716103,"NET, AMD, QCOM, and AMAT... are they a buy? (Basic DD/ discussion)NET=  $67

-52 week high= $95.77
-BVPS= 2.722
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate -0.13, actually -0.12
-PE= Unavailable 
-ROE= -15.2%
-Net income= -120M
-Operating cash flow= -17M
1 year growth= +197%

I know everyone is saying that NET is a buy and that its a steal at this price... but when you look at the financial profile i just dont see it? I see its up 197% over the year which is a ton. Am i missing something? Outside of it being hit hard by the correction we are in i feel its very high risk

AMD= $76

-52 week high= $99.23
-BVPS= 4.82
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 1.23, actually 1.29
-PE= ???
-ROE= 58%
-Net income= 2.5B
-Operating cash flow= 1.1B
1 year growth= 67%

EDIT- webull shows PE >200... other websites are showing anywhere from 37-65.
 
This is one im watching pretty heavily. I feel that the only downside i see to this one is that the PE is so high. However everything else looks solid. They have a heavy hand in the chip/ semi world too. Looking at the one year chart it had a massive upward spike around august/ September and now appears with this dip to be back on its normal trajectory. Its currently running below the 1 year 200 EMA also. And is running at the 5 year 50 EMA. this one to me seems like a for sure buy. Though i suspect this to still fall with the rest of tech for a little while longer. 

QCOM= $127.28

-52 week high= $167.94
-BVPS= 6.5
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 3.93, actually 4.19
-PE= 21.74
-ROE= 95%
-Net income= 5.2B
-Operating cash flow= 5.8B
1 year growth= 95%

Of the 4 listed this one has the lowest PE. It definitely took a little hit with this correction and is down a good bit. This one also had a large run up in 2020 and appears to be normalizing down on its trajectory sitting right above the 50 EMA for the 5 year and below the 200 EMA for 1 year. This company will have a heavy hand in 5G and while last year in my opinion priced a lot of that in i think itll still have a consistent growth which is what i want. It also has a dividend of 2.6 as a nice bonus. 

AMAT= $119.72

-52 week high= $125.8
-BVPS= 12.5
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 4.07, actually 4.17
-PE= 28.63
-ROE= 39%
-Net income= 3.62B
-Operating cash flow= 3.8B
1 year growth= +167%

AMAT is a backside play on the semiconductor world. They compared to the rest of the group have removed the best from this dip. I would almost say people are viewing this as a value play since its a manufacturer with a reasonable PE. I am curious if this will actually dip or not since its current running above the 20 EMA for 1 year. But i think this will continue to run as we are in such a massive shortage of chips. 

My order of buy would be 

QCOM
AMAT
AMD
NET

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-march-25.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures turn lower after Fed chief Powell comments

> * U.S. stock futures turned lower Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition” that Covid economic stimulus and vaccinations allowed the U.S. economy to recover faster than expected and that central bankers, at some point, may be able to pull back emergency support.

> * Late-day selling reversed gains and dragged the S&P 500 down 0.6% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped lower in the final seconds of Wednesday’s session. The Nasdaq dropped 2% after a slightly higher open gave way to a day of selling. Tech stocks were lower despite the 10-year Treasury yield holding below recent a 14-month high as a market rotation out of high-flying growth names continued. The Nasdaq last closed at a record last month. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs last week.

> * The Labor Department is set to report its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the stock market opens. Economists expect 735,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down 35,000 from the prior week, which saw an unexpected jump even as many states relaxed Covid mitigation restrictions on businesses.

*****

> # 2. AstraZeneca revises Covid vaccine data with lower efficacy rate

> * AstraZeneca late Wednesday issued updated Covid vaccine numbers from its late-stage trial in the U.S. and Latin America after U.S. health officials earlier this week questioned the accuracy of preliminary data. The U.K.-based drug giant now said its vaccine is 76% effective in protecting against symptomatic cases of virus. A release issued on Monday reported an efficacy rate of 79%. AstraZeneca reiterated its two-shot regimen was “well tolerated” among participants and no safety concerns were identified.

*****

> # 3. Biden to hold first news conference of presidency

> * The White House announced Thursday that it’s dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural communities. More than 25% of the entire U.S. population received at least one vaccine dose, including 14% who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two shots, while Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is only one shot.

> * Against the backdrop of rising Covid cases in many states and more than 30 million total U.S. infections, President Joe Biden is set to hold his first news conference. He’s expected to point to a surge in vaccinations, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the latest sweeping stimulus package. He’s also likely to face a wide range of questions from U.S.-Mexico border security to gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia.

*****

> # 4. Oil prices slide as Covid concerns outweigh Suez Canal disruptions

> * Oil prices fell Thursday as fuel demand concerns re-emerged alongside worries about steps back in the global fight against Covid. Prices of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude and the Brent international benchmark each dropped roughly 2%, one day after they both surged nearly 6% on the crude shipping disruptions caused by the grounding of a giant container ship in the Suez Canal, a major trade route. It could “take weeks” to clear, according to the CEO of a Dutch company helping with the salvage efforts.

*****

> # 5. Lawmakers to press tech CEOs over speech, misinformation

> * Big Tech leaders Thursday are scheduled to testify at a virtual House panel hearing on efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns Google and YouTube, will face increased pressure following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the rise in Covid vaccine misinformation. There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted online.

I recently began trading options. The meme stonks were some of my first purchases. I made out on some AMC calls while I had some expire worthless. Overall, I'm still up, but I have options that I will probably lose out on for this week. I bought a bunch of calls during the recent runup, and they've since gotten hammered when AMC, EXPR dropped over the past few days. I decided to buy AMC puts to hedge. As of EOD yesterday and even this morning, those puts were up 150% and I didn't sell them. F'ckn greed man...Idiotic of me not to sell. Now that I think of it, they were a hedge and I effectively hedged, but I didn't take the profit. Instead, those puts are now in the red. Complete, monstrous fail on my part. I know I failed and I need to be better.

I have issues. Going to get back to basics and work on bettering myself...",
md50hx,gs7aqlx,StockMarket,comment,1616697625,Yup. Greed will grab your ass off the moon and bring you back down to earth. My new rule after losing 93% of my portfolio (I only play options) is to sell if im up 40 to MAYBE 50% at any time. More than 50% is dangerous. Just as quick as it goes up it will come back down. Dont get greedy bro profit is profit. Ive learned the hard way. Learn from your mistakes.,
md50hx,gs7j3ii,StockMarket,comment,1616701013,"One trick is, you have to make sure your puts are at a higher strike price than the call options that you bought if they both expire in the same week.

I had a 3/26 $8 call option that I bought weeks ago and a 3/26 $11 put option I bought on tuesday this week based on the dropping of the stock. You see where this is going right?

I thought my $8 call was going to expire worthless because it had dropped to the $9 range yesterday. 
But today proved me wrong. When it had continous growth all morning around $9, I excercised my $11 put and got $1100. Then when it hit around $10 later, I excercised my $8 call and bought back those 100 shares and earned an extra $300.

md50hx,gs9c09d,StockMarket,comment,1616734100,"I had the same problem with greed. True story, In the middle of the GME saga right before AMC took off to $20 I bought 50 contracts at $10 3/19 call options for .97 a piece (so I had $5000 in it) 3 days later AMC went to $20 a share and I was sitting on $80,000....can you imagine that luck. I watched that $80,000 disappear over a 2 week period by fucking it away. This will sound stupid but that was the best moment of my trading life losing all that money because it taught me how to be a better trader. I took a risk, did my research, was spot on with it, made tremendous returns on it, but then got greedy and deserved what I got.

At 25 years old I got off pretty easy because I know and have seen others who lost everything (millions and years of work).

I’ve got myself to a point now where I see the bigger picture. A weekly 5% return would outperform the market, 25, 50, 75, 100% returns are all great, and if you can get your equity out of a position and let your profits run then you’ve taken a lot of risk away.

Believe in yourself, make a plan and stick to it, and reduce risks when possible, and as referenced in the movie The Wolf of Wall Street sometimes you just got to jack off because this can be some stressful shit sometimes.",

**\[Very Long Post\]**

# What’s the story of the company?

[TSM](https://imgur.com/0IJCk3R) is the biggest chip foundry to provide 7 & 5 nanometer chips that became very popular after Apple moved their chip design in-house. Apple isn’t the only company that works with TSM with other big names like AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Qualcomm and even companies that also build their own chips like INTEL & NXP use TSM do increase their capacity.

Late last year the company also received approval to build a $12B chip plant in Phoenix, which will be a welcomed by the US, as chip demand has far outpaced the supply currently available around the world.

I know it might sound weird, but guys, in my opinion, I believe this $500B [company](https://imgur.com/gMPb0Pb) which has risen by more than 150% in the last year after the 2020 lows, still has some room to grow 

# Competition & Product 

I believe that TSM has a great advantage compared to companies that operate in their industry, as they have invested huge amounts of money in capital expenditures to gain competitive advantages compared to Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Broadcom & others.

We can also take a look at what Seeking Alpha Quant Factor [grades](https://imgur.com/KIQyCtO) the company, and we can see that TSM does pretty good in all 5 categories, Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum & EPS Revisions.

One other thing we can see here, is that after the huge spike in price, the dividend yield of the company still has room to recover, as the 4-year average yields stands at over 3%, second only to Qualcomm

# MOAT – Easy to replicate? Branding value? Dominance over Marketplace? TAM?

You are also probably wondering what is the MOAT of the company? Do they have a branding value or some kind of dominance over the Marketplace?

Well, from my point of view, TSM has a significant MOAT against most of its competition as they’ve been able to collect huge amounts of knowledge from its diverse base of over 500 customers which have helped them leap ahead of other companies since the 7NM move in 2018.

TSM pretty much [supplies](https://imgur.com/l5ekttM) all the big companies I mentioned earlier which later pass on the technology to their customers, so it’s very likely that you are using one of their chips in some of your devices, maybe your iPhone, your car, computer or anything else.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/M9MMUfn), the MOAT TSM has over Intel, as Intel is still a long way back, working on older generation chips, while TSM is leading the pack.

I believe their market dominance in the 7NM & 5NM chips will continue to keep TSM as the preferred manufactured for most fabless companies just like Apple which currently [represents](https://imgur.com/TkAR5kR) over 20% of TSM revenues, it seems to me that TSM is the best foundry to own for the next decade, as the worldwide revenue of semis [topped](https://imgur.com/X9iqLlY) $40B to start 2021, with [TSM](https://imgur.com/3unNxtB) being the only one of its pears to see a significant growth, with a big chunk of that coming from the huge demand Apple will provide them for the 5NM chips, which accounts for over 50% of their 5NM [sales](https://imgur.com/OyfFsEN).

Friends, this is just my opinion, but I even dare to say that their total addressable market it’s pretty much limitless in the foreseeable future.

Semiconductors are here to stay as technology will only continue to evolve, with smaller & smaller chips in the future and competitors still struggling to catch up with the 5NM technology that TSM already has, so TSM should be poised to remain one of the biggest companies in the world for the foreseeable future

I believe now is the time we need to get to some of the company’s financials & metrics

# Company Growth & Balance Sheet

Revenue/ Net Income Growth? Profitability?

Let’s start by taking a [look](https://imgur.com/mvUGLnO) at how the companies revenues and gross profit have evolved in the past years, and we can see that with the exception of 2018, TSM has seen a continued growth with 2020 being a booming year as gross profit increased by more than 50% with operating income also increasing by more than 60%, which in my eyes is pretty remarkable given the size of the company.

[TSM](https://imgur.com/jHWdJrY) has managed to post a positive net income in the last 10 years, seeing an increase of over 400% in that same period, so, I hold the opinion that this will continue on the same path for the next 10 years as well 

# Cash / Debt / Net Debt & Dilution

Looking at the balance [sheet](https://imgur.com/MUCFRtx) of the company, we also find that TSM has an excellent financial situation, with over $38B in current assets, which can easily pay off the $22B in current liabilities or the $32B in total current & long-term [liabilities](https://imgur.com/kE1mKDV), so the company is way more than solvent.

# Lastest Earnings Reports & Predictions of Revenue Streams / Cost of Sales & Others

It seems to me that TSM [posted](https://imgur.com/mmqloyJ) some terrific numbers yet again in Q4 of 2020, delivering almost $13B in revenues up 22% YoY with 5NM technology already accounting for 20% of wafer revenue as the 5G technology and super-cycle is just starting, with telecom companies struggling to keep up with the increasing demand.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/ZGM9b2N) that the 5NM was already the 2nd biggest revenue stream for the company in the 4th quarter and I would say that it’s pretty likely only going to increase, as this only accounted for 8% of 2020’s [revenues](https://imgur.com/RJmakFU), especially as Smartphone [account](https://imgur.com/B7UHPHO) for almost half of TSM revenues from last year, with only the automotive sector seeing a small decline, which was expected, but should recover in the next years, as cars had a bad year given the events of 2020 and they will also very likely contain more & more chips as companies continue to innovate.

TSM also provided a revenue guidance similar to last quarter as gross profit margins are still expected to come in at over 50% 

# Dividends?

One last thing that we should look at before moving on to future projections is how the company is continuing to growth their [dividend](https://imgur.com/Kxhyy2b). 

As far as I am concerned, dividend investing is not really my favorite but this is an important thing to look at when looking for companies to buy to maintain a balanced portfolio.

TSM only offers a $1.79 dividend but this has seen a 13.5% growth rate in the past 5 years and given that things are only getting better, I think this can continue as well.

I guess now’s the time to move on to what is the current upside and the long-term potential for TSM

# Current Upside / Long Term Upside?

First, let’s start with my [expectations](https://imgur.com/r87yUGF) of the revenue streams, costs of goods, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

I believe we can continue to see a steady growth in their total sales, that will end up doubling by 2025, reaching over $108B. On the other side, I also believe we can continue to see a gross margin of 54%, similar with what we saw last quarter.

The other operating expenses from R&D and SG&A I pretty much expect to remain the same, as this has been steady over the years, so, a 2.7% of the revenues should go in SG&A and 8.3% should continue to go into continued R&D to keep the companies MOAT.

I would say that TSM is very likely to continue to invest a lot of money in Capex to keep up with the increasing semiconductors demand, so this should continue to grow at around 2.5%/year.

All of these numbers should get us an operating income of almost $27B for 2025, though, there are other things like interest income & expenses that we should account for, but for TSM, this should add up to a slight gain of $400M in 2025.

Finally the effective tax rate of the [company](https://imgur.com/pkOEifS), has stood under 12% for the last 3 years, but, for safety reasons I will imply a small increase each year, which would [result](https://imgur.com/KbtxhZG) in TSM having a net income of just over $24B in 2025, paying out a dividend of $3.24, while also not diluting their shares, as TSM hasn’t [diluted](https://imgur.com/oflEVtF) their stock significantly since 2005.

# Price to Earnings (PE) Valuation

PE Valuations are my favorite way to quickly & pretty accurately determine reasonable future prices for stocks. 

Taking into account all the numbers we went through earlier, my [view](https://imgur.com/gwgvpXI) is that we can see TSM trading anywhere between a 25 and a 40 PE by 2025, which given the $4.64 EPS for 2025 would mean the stock can trade between $116 and $185, but, before moving on to the final price targets let’s also take a quick look at TSM discounted free cash flow valuation.

# DCF 

I [implied](https://imgur.com/hNWP9E2) the same growth rate for TSM revenues and actually lowered their EBIT as a % of their revenues each year by .5%, and after taking into account their effective tax rate, their D&A, capital expenditures and net working capital I arrived at a $71.5B free cash flow by 2025.

As always I also added their net assets and used a 3% long-term growth rate just to be conservative and for the perpetuity approach we got a price target of $86, meaning the company is potentially overvalued at the moment, though, on the other hand, the EBITDA approach, using a 20x multiplier, would results in a price target of $178. 

I like to use an average approach of this numbers, which would results in a price target of $132, or a 21% upside in the next 12 months for the company, not including any additional dividends received.

# Technical Chart

Looking at a short-term [chart](https://imgur.com/qgvPpXM), we find that TSM is pretty underbought right now with an RSI of 36, but the volumes in the stock are slightly increasing.

It seems to me that the next support level for TSM stands at $103 while the next resistance is just above my 12-month price target for the company, as TSM had a fake breakout over $135 in the middle of last month.

# Wall St. Opinion

I always take a look after I’ve finished my DD to what analysts say, and in this case, they have a $137 PT for the [company](https://imgur.com/xAVfqN4) slightly higher than my own DD, so it seems I was pretty accurate with my expectations.

[Analysts](https://imgur.com/l6EndWo) also expect a 72B on average, while my estimates are the top end of their range, but on the other hand, I only have an EPS of 4.64$ in 2025, compared to $5.6 expected by them by 2023.

# Weaknesses

When looking at what companies you should invest in, it’s recommended to also take into account their potential weaknesses.

I have no doubt that TSM does have some weaknesses, but probably the biggest one is that they really so much on their Apple revenues, though, it’s hard to believe Apple will move away from TSM anytime soon, or even if that happens that TSM won’t find other customers in need of their products in a short period of time, especially now with the huge worldwide chip shortage.

While writing this post, we also received [news](https://imgur.com/MCjAWXZ) from INTEL that they are planning on building 2 new foundries in Arizona. This might provide even more pressure on the current price of TSM, but, in my humble opinion, i think this just more buzz, with Intel still laggining behind in technology, not even having the 7NM available, while TSM is already working on 2 & 3NM developments. So, i'd take this as another opportunity to ""buy the dip""

# Short Selling? Institutional Holding?

The company has such a solid future that the percentage of [shares](https://imgur.com/wl06zGs) sold on the short side is under .3%, which is one of the lowest I have ever seen in a company.

Though, on the other hand, the stock isn’t that largely [owned](https://imgur.com/ndoKXcs) by institutions, with JP Morgan leading the pack with under 1%, buy, my guess is that’s because this isn’t a US based company, which does make it less attractive to big investment banks & funds.

I bet that you are just waiting to see the final price targets and my final opinion, so let’s jump to that right now

# Final Opinion & Prediction!

In my [opinion](https://imgur.com/P7OQKtb), TSM is a must have stock in most portfolios, brining some balance, with good growth ahead of it. TSM might helped lower the beta of most portfolios that are way to heavy on the overhyped tech stocks right now.

Remember, this is just my humble opinion as a retail investor, this is not an investment advice, but my view is that we can see TSM moving towards the $132 range by early next year, with TSM likely to be jump-started again around their next [earnings](https://imgur.com/ClXzJZG) report in April 

Regarding the long-term [view](https://imgur.com/dgQTLy7), my base TSM target is $150 by 2025, meaning an ROI of 38% which is not that great, but when taking into account the expected dividends received from TSM, that can jump to over 50% 

Speaking personally, my 2025 Price [Targets](https://imgur.com/9ZWdcb5) for TSM range from an average of the 25 & 30 PE multiple, my base case from the 30 & 35, while my bull case averages de 35 & 40 PE multiple prices.

# Summary

* With pent-up consumer demand people are looking for social and exciting experiences outside of the house, Drive Shack has the answer with the perfect social entertainment experience
* Drive Shack brings people together in social and technology driven environment (Similar to top golf if you are familiar with the concept). Golf games combined with a bar/restaurant.
* They recently beat earnings, have a strong financial position, and are just starting to hit their stride with significant partnerships and new venues opening up this summer.

# Consumer Market Overview

The Return of Consumer Spending ([here](https://www.jpmorgan.com/commercial-banking/insights/the-return-of-consumer-spending))

* Last year’s federal stimulus packages helped real household income grow 3.7% in 2020, more than twice as fast as in 2019.
* A return to normal lifestyle activities combined with significant pent-up consumer demand will likely spell the best kind of news for the hard-hit hospitality, travel and restaurant sectors.
* The Bottom Line - The pieces are in place for above-trend retail growth in 2021. Consumers are in a very strong position as vaccines hopefully bring the pandemic to an end.

# Company Overview: Drive Shack

Drive Shack Inc. is a publicly traded leisure and entertainment company focused on bringing people together through technology driven competitive socializing experiences. Recent investors presentation is [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318) – provides a great rundown of the business and financials. I recommend checking it out (better than me providing a bunch of images)

**How they make money**

1. Operating traditional golf course - still operating but recently sold a few golf courses
2. Drive Shack Venues – they currently operate 4 and are committed to opening 2 more
3. Puttery Venues – What is Puttery? Using state-of-the-art mini golf, Puttery combines competitive socializing, food & beverage and technology to create one remarkable experience.

* The first 2 are opening this summer in Dallas TX, and Charlotte, NC – looking to expand and have a number of targets in the pipeline. They expect to open or nearly complete 5 additional Puttery locations in 2021 and open 10 venues in 2022

**Key Financial Metrics**

* **P/S is 1.24** – the lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the investment, and this is relatively low in the leisure segment when compared to it’s peers
* **EPS Growth is 62% for next yea**r – this is a positive sign for DS
* **Institutes own 29%** \- this signals that they are confident in this company
* **Analyst have a target price of $5.00** – which seems fair considering growth potential of DS
* **\~$86M of unrestricted cash on han**d as of February 28, 2021 – great to cover expansions and growth costs

**5 Year DCF for Drive Shack (**[**here**](https://finbox.com/NYSE:DS/models/dcf-revenue-exit-5yr)**)**

Note - DCFs are obviously sensitive to inputs so please take this into consideration and check out the model/adjust inputs for a few scenarios. I projected revenue growth at 20% for 2021, 2022, and 2023. Based on these assumptions **the fair value price for DS is $7.19**

Insider Buying and Selling ([here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ds/insider-activity))

* Buying is typically a good sign, whereas selling is a bad sign. initially looking at the 2 sells by insiders might be a bit concerning, but if we look at the total number of shares sold it only represents 2% of the total shares traded. I view this as a positive sign for Drive Shack

# Recent Timeline of Drive Shack

March 14, 2021 - Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates ([here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html)) - analysts expected significantly lower revenue due to COVD but DS was able to beat these estimates

* Drive Shack's (DS) earnings of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.

Jan 29, 2021 - Drive Shack Inc. Announces Pricing of Public Offering of Common Stock ([here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-inc-announces-pricing-115900378.html)) – price dropped to \~$2.40 based on this news, which makes sense when there is a public offering

* Priced its underwritten public offering of 20,833,334 shares of common stock at a price to the public of **$2.40** per share for gross proceeds of approximately $50 million.

Jan 26, 2021 - Drive Shack Inc. Announces Collaboration with Professional Golfer Rory McIlroy and its New Indoor Entertainment Golf Experience, Puttery ([here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-inc-announces-collaboration-172400652.html)) – price popped to \~$3 on this news

* ""I am thrilled to partner with the Drive Shack team on their new entertainment golf experience,"" said Rory McIlroy. ""Once Covid is under control, the ability to combine high-tech mini-golf with a high quality food & beverage menu will make Puttery a great experience for any social gathering\*\*. I am personally making a financial investment in the growth of future Puttery venues across the country and can’t wait to debut our first Puttery in Dallas this summer.""\*\*
* From my perspective this is a huge partnership and they might be looking to get other golfers on board (John Daly might be a good fit…)

# Risks

* **Building Costs/Delays** – They are banking on opening 2 Puttery locations which will drive significant revenue starting this summer. If there are delays in completing these venues this will impact their cash flow\*\*.\*\* They have projected the total costs to develop these locations and with any type of construction project there is always the risk of cost overrun
* **Current Ratio is 0.7** \- The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. A current ratio of less than one may seem alarming, although different situations can affect the current ratio in a solid company. This might be a bit concerning for DS. Negative revenue through 2020 due to COVID played a role and they are still developing a number of new venues. Something to be aware of, especially if there is a delay in brining the 2 new Puttery venues online.

# TLDR

* Pent-up consumer demand will continue to drive spending in the entertainment space, especially social activities outside of the house (bars, restaurants, activities, etc.)
* Drive Shack provides the perfect combination of social activity, bar/restaurant, and technology
* They landed a great strategic partnership, are aiming to open 2 new venues in the summer of 2021, and if executed properly they can capture the pent-up demand for social entertainment experiences

mcxj3f,,StockMarket,post,1616676795,"Goodmorning Traders ... Put your helmets on and buckle up its coming... my 3/25/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY 

Good morning Traders, Put your helmets on and buckle up its coming... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things...[Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 3 25 21](https://youtu.be/SCegRGizfdo) 

📷

Put your helmets on and buckle up its coming... A roller coaster ride of volatility. Yesterday we had a move of 5.2 points on the spy nearly straight down, and most of it was done with a positive advance decline line. Now consider with all the movement we have had this week are just below where we started the week. The market makers expected move is 396.8 at the top and 382.16 at the bottom, there is a high probability we tag one of those numbers by or before expiration Friday.   That means a huge move today and or tomorrow. The upcoming roller coaster ride will be different, usually roller coasters have a slow tick, tick, tick up then screaming down. The roller coaster the market is about to ride is going to go screaming up then a nice orderly pace down for a good while. This could start today or next week not completely sure but get ready it seems to be on the way which is surprising with the amount of stimulus/ liquidity floating around. In my estimation I though the stimulus would have kept this from coming for months but it's still possible this could be a tremor before the real earthquake move which could still be months away. Now what to expect today, try to identify day structure early we have a trend down day structure setting up so here are the possible outcomes for today.1) Trend day down model set up, at some point we get a have hearted try to fill the gap of yesterdays close of 387.48 and fail to a likely target of 382 area 2) Rounded reversal set up (Trange day). We head straight down toward 382area where we see a turnaround erasing a good bit of the losses of the day. Consolidate between 388 and 393 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. 3) We hold and consolidate between 385 and 388 area before breaking higher or lower. 

1) Trend day down model set up, at some point we get a have hearted try to fill the gap of yesterdays close of 387.48 and fail to a likely target of 382 area. **50% probability** 

2) Rounded reversal set up (Trange day). We head straight down toward 382area where we see a turnaround erasing a good bit of the losses of the day. Consolidate between 388 and 393 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. **40% probability** 

3) We hold and consolidate between 385 and 388 area before breaking higher or lower. **10% probability**",['GPS']

So it may be relatively benign to you, but to a new investor they likely just entered the market with their savings and have now lost thousands of those savings in an environment where news orgs and big name investors are telling them that there's an impending crash.

Hope it will help you too.

TL;DR: $SAVA, $RIOT, $OCGN, $PNM, $MTCH

**1.** **Cassava Sciences Inc. ($SAVA) -** biopharmaceutical company focused on neuroscience. Traffic has increased due to the rapid progress in the development of a drug from Alzheimer’s disease.

[$SAVA](https://preview.redd.it/afk25x4p31p61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cc0e55b5fc499d0703a6059ac78361fef35b1)

**2. Riot Blockchain Inc. ($RIOT)** \-  bitcoin mining company which maintains bitcoin blockchain. Everything is quite obvious here - the company is associated with bitcoin, so the more world’s interest in bitcoin - the more interest in $RIOT (just my opinion, perhaps the reason is different).

[$RIOT](https://preview.redd.it/heezniou31p61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=453457a1849fbfcebabccbabacce7f7564735d97)

**3. Ocugen Inc. ($OCGN)** \- same as for $SAVA, it’s a biopharmaceutical company. I think the traffic has increased due to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.

&#x200B;

[$OCGN](https://preview.redd.it/j2cjgrny31p61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc20bb16869b23ae6f090273cd413cfc2404a264)

4. **PNM Resources Inc. ($PNM)** \- electricity provider, energy holding company. The reason for the sharp increase in website’s traffic is not clear to me here. Apparently these guys know how to do their business.

&#x200B;

[$PNM](https://preview.redd.it/hcpgkoz341p61.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=7817a451d49404f61f6c8347a23bf4f4fce90439)

5. **Match Group Inc. ($MTCH) -** The reasons for the traffic’s growth are not obvious here as well. Most likely it grows organically.

Half the battle with stocks is the battle in your mind. I find red days, and especially the most recent weeks easier to cope with if I just stick to these rules.

&#x200B;

* **Only use funds that I would not need in an emergency** (Have savings elsewhere eg Bonds ISA's etc, don't have your entire savings into stocks, you never know when your going to need it)
* **A diverse portfolio will have it's losers** (No matter how much of a Wiz you are at the stock market your going to have a stock that fails)
* **Remember your reasoning for investing** (If your down -20% on a stock but plan to sell in 5 years it's not necessarily panic stations)
* **Sometimes it's good to go against the grain** (unpopular one this, but Paper hands will always leave you in profit)
* **sometimes your not ""too late""** (If you hear about a certain company on the news many people would assume they're to late to get involved in the stock. Do some research, sometimes it's good to follow the hype too! Don't get stuck with FOMO)
* **If you find yourself constantly looking at your phone wondering if you should hold or sell take a break**
* **Look at the percentages rather than your money** ( -6% isn't too bad, but -£1,206 looks BAD!)

Read some books about investing, I've read a few and it really does help! (The intelligent Investor is a bit outdated but it's brilliant!)

If anyone else has any advice to give about the mental side on investing feel free to post :)",

mcfiy9,,StockMarket,post,1616617064,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 24, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.

Market participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. 

After a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. 

The rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

I took a few swing positions in 5 of my favorite stocks (all growth stocks) about 10 days ago. Originally I had planned for 2-3 day swing trade. All these companies were trading at a great discount from all time highs after the market wide sell off a few weeks back. I bought in during the rally and of course it was right before the bond yield scare and current chaos plunged the NASDAQ. My entire account is tied up in these trades and I guess I could’ve managed my dollar cost averaging better but I just didn’t foresee a major market correction, especially since the market had just finished selling off a good chunk. 

I’m leaning towards holding out. Since all of my stocks have reached oversold on the RSI (of course that doesn’t mean they can’t continue to sell off) but unless we’re heading for a serious market correction it just wouldn’t make sense to cash out and buy back in.

mcf30d,,StockMarket,post,1616615979,"Robinhood files for IPO despite GameStop backlash Robinhood announced that it has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), on Tuesday.

It’s likely that you already know what Robinhood is, due to the recent craziness on Wall Street. But if you need a refresher, it’s the trading app that many of the retail investors used to buy up stocks of GameStop, sending the stock up as much as 500%. 

Although the saga created a ton of free publicity for the zero-commission trading app, the company also came under fire from Congress for limiting its trades.

The filing comes as a bold move for the company after its rough start to the year, but perhaps it is its way of bouncing back from the bad press, and capitalizing on its enormous surge in usage—an additional 6 million in the first two months of 2021. 

The company has selected Nasdaq to list its shares on and has filed confidentially with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Other established startups, like Airbnb, Lyft, Slack and Palantir, have also filed IPOs confidentially—allowing them to keep their financial details private for the time being. 

Since its founding in 2013, Robinhood has been steadily growing its customer base, gaining 13 million users by the end of 2020. The California-based upstart pioneered zero-commission stock trading and disrupted the old-school industry of brokerage platforms like Charles Schwab, E-Trade, and Fidelity with its gamified approach to trading.

The company’s flurry of new customers has definitely gotten the attention of Wall Street lately, with its valuation rising from $12 billion in September 2020 to $20 billion by the end of the year, and then doubling to $40 billion in February 2021.

In addition today and yesterday listening to Fast Money/ Squak i noticed they mentioned the same thing... but in a different way. They mentioned that PE's for ""value"" are slowly  reaching PE's of ""tech"" and that with that people are going to jump back into the tech stocks thinking they are getting a deal now which will effectively cause a rotation back to tech.

He's not always right, but if you track his picks, he beats the market. By a wide margin.

This is usually how rotations into value happen; it is a short-lived thing. But that doesn't mean the big tech stocks will re-inflate, just the ones that got left out in the cold during the rotation will recover. The correction won't evaporate, it is just that the continued influx of money into the market will put things back in an upward direction. But probably a lot more spread out now, with a continued emphasis on value; its just that it doesn't take long for it get harder to find obvious value.

Calling it a ""rotation back"" might be an over-statement, maybe it is better to just say that interest will be renewed.

GME is at like <20% shorted float right now, down from 114%. There will not be another huge spike in price and you will lose the majority of your investment if you plan to hold. 

Please for the love of everything that you hold dear, do some more research outside of Reddit before investing your stimulus check, especially if you need even a fraction of it.

That being said, I’m just some dude on the internet, what do I know? If you really don’t need the money at all and are okay with the 5-10% chance that it’ll spike up to reach a new high then go for it.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

mdpi46,,wallstreetbets,post,1616767847,"I’ve lost everything because of the Suez Canal fiasco on the Egyptian/ European Easter bunny future run upI spent $50,000 on surefire Egyptian bunny rabbit futures. This was money that was supposed to be saved for buying a new house and was mainly accrued from dumping pay checks into SPY over the years. 

On the 27th of February , I got tipped off from a buddy that works in the bunny breeding industry. He said that due to the pandemic, Europeans were buying pets like crazy, and one animal in particular... bunny rabbits. 

Now this made me look into Egyptian bunny futures as they produce the most bunnies in the world. The premiums were amazing, this was like buying fucking apple at IPO. On top of all of this, Easter was just a couple months around the corner and a massive shipment of bunnies was meant to leave Egypt and make its way to a port in France. I’m talking a fucking boat load of carrot munching, sex hungry, “what’s up doc” mother fuckers, not just a container. 

So I placed my bet, expiring the week of Easter, for when the shipment would come. Since there were barely any bunnies in France/ all of Europe, there was no supply to meet demand. However, I had it on good authority that prices would barely drop since so many Europeans wanted the little fluffy fucks. 

All was going well, my money was going up and it was the most euphoric feeling ever...

Until on Wednesday at 10am, I wake up to check how many unrealized tendies I have. To my horror I was down 48%. I frantically called my aforementioned buddy in the industry and he tells me to look up the Suez canal. 

It turns out the shipment was delayed by a day out of Egypt and right after they left port, some big fucking ship decided to block the whole canal. Since Egypt shipped out essentially every last bunny in the damn country, they didn’t need any more bunny food. So every single one of them is going to run out of food over the next week and die on that ship (no point in bringing them back to port cause there’s no food to feed them). Once they arrive in France they will dump the dead bunnies, pick up the next shipment and move on. 

Idk how I’m going to tell my wife this, probably gonna need some protection from her boyfriend for a while too. 

Wish me luck",['AAPL']

mdnfyc,,wallstreetbets,post,1616761452,"Suez Canal BlockageIf you don't know wtf is happening then just Google ""Suez Canal Blockage"" and come back. 

I believe there is more to the story. And the Blockage might not be solved until weeks from now (maybe more who knows?) in case everything went smooth and no fuxk ups and wreckage happens because it's a VERY BIG ASS SHIP that blocked the whole thing sideways. 

The longer this disruption persists, the wider the ripple effects will be. Understand?
I was thinking about the ripple effect and how that might affect the world trade. Why? 

%10 of world trade by tonnage passes through the Suez Canal
%9 of the world's seaborne oil (5.5 million barrels of oil) passes EVERYDAY!

We need think out loud and discuss how the fuxk we can benefit from that. 
What instruments? And why? 
And I will edit the post for you dear apes. 

Long Oil while we think about fuxking the world economy this weekend.

Edit1: Tankers could be a play.. $NAT has some potential to capitalize on the situation because of their fleet is Suezmax size etc

(1) it’s not serious until it is meaning it only really matters if ships start routing around Africa / this takes more than a week 

(2) oil going to Europe and natural gas going from Russia to Asia will be by far the hardest hit so I am treating the price of energy as my early canary. If the price of energy isn’t jerking up then I don’t see this being important enough to trade on.

I know many have suggested at avoiding posting positions but these are all already posted and you can bet your ass Melvin and Citadel have some fancy high tech script or a whipping boy intern that has already extracted this info. So being that I am a retard I am not going to write a script like some nerd but like a true ape I am going to repeatedly bang my head on the keyboard and go through every YOLO GME tagged post in both the last 7 days and the last 30 days and add them all up.  Not sure if I went through them all or reddit caps each range at 250 posts. Anyway I de duped the data I was able to collect.

In Past 7 days I recorded 78 user yolos with a total 161,402 shares. At an after hours market price close of 192.12 worth $31,008,552.24. With DFV making up 100k of those shares and another user making up 21k shares. Excluding these Kongs the mean of these yolos was 531 shares. 


In the past 30 days I recorded 155 user yolos with a total 250,437 shares. At an after hours market price close of 192.12 worth $48,113,956.44. With DFV making up 100k of those shares and another user making up 21k shares. Excluding these Kongs the mean of these yolos was  852 shares. 


Assumptions: I am assuming users have diamond hands and didn’t sell their positions. I am making all sorts of other retarded assumptions about ratio of yolo submitter and other shit. What ever don’t skewer me.

The rule of 1% on the internet says the ratio of poster to upvoter to viewer is 1:9:90 on reddit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29

 So it is kind of retarded to post a yolo from personal security perspective and I believe for every yolo poster there are 9 or 90 silent other Kongs. Just for fun if we pretend this is true. 

Ratio of 1:9 means 1,395 WSB Kongs control 2,253,933 shares 

Ratio of 1:90 means 13,950 WSB Kongs control 22,539,330 shares. 

Yeah that might all be bullshit I am really high. But anyway we know in the last 30 days 155 WSB yolos have bought 250,437 shares currently worth over 48 million dollars.

I remember hearing that half of all robinhood users have GameStop stock back in January. They have 23 million users, so 11.5m. Average account size of 5k. And since I’m sure not everyone is balls deep with all of their portfolio in just GME, we’ll cut that down to $1500. 

**That would be 17.25 billion dollars, or roughly 90 million shares at current market value.** That’s not accounting for any other platforms. This is why I disagree with the narrative that retail is simply riding the coat tails of whales. I think retail is the whale, and a much larger one than anyone realizes.

Edit: corrected numbers, adding this snippet from CNBC article Incase link not allowed

“JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan estimates Robinhood's total accounts are now closer to 23 million, including the 3 million gained in January and 10 million users added in 2020 as investing from home boomed during the pandemic.

Robinhood's Tenev told Congress last week the company had delivered more than $35 billion in realized gains to investors, which implies big growth in customers and customer assets. Its average account size is about $5,000, the company said”",

mdpy7o,,wallstreetbets,post,1616769144,"Greater Fool Theory and it's Implications To GMEHey kids, today we are going to talk about *Greater Fool Theory*

Investopedia defines Greater Fool Theory as follows:

*The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.*

Now you may be thinking, **are we the greater fools?** I bought at 250 like a good little ape, and my answer is *no*.

First, let's acknowledge that GME is not worth $200, or $300, or $420.69, or $8008.101 . We aren't betting on the actual value, we're betting on the greater fools. We're betting on the short squeeze, and *its day will come*.

Melvin, Shitron, and other HF's will devolve below the monke and turn into single celled organisms only capable of breeding and shitting.

How can I confirm this? Lets do some retard math.

The average IQ defined in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale is 90-109, and since we're smooth brained, and in the ""Extremely low"" category, we're defined as 69 and below. So let's say we're all 69(nice). There are 9,665,680 r/WSB members at the time of writing. Multiply total users by 69 and we get **666,931,920**. With our combined monke IQ's we have decided we like the stock. Melvin has 33 employees, who we'll say are in the ""Superior"" IQ classification of 130 and above. Using maths, we can conclude their combined IQ is 4,290. So who is the greater fool, Melvin, who doesn't like the stock with an IQ of 4,290, or r/WSB, with a combined retard strength of 666,931,920 who like stonk.

So get your chickens ready, the deep fryer is heating up and tendies will be ready soon.

Regarding Share ownership, the sole information that I like to see is the increase in the number of buyers (+6.25% since last week). So I'm happy to see that my fellow 🦍 buy the dip and hodl. Concerning the increase in institutional positions I wouldn't bother much since we all know that this is an open fight between giants.

This is the juicy part: option monitoring. Basically, you can see that there's a lot of calls already ITM and that could be ITM today --> 🦍 could exercise them and hodl, therefore decreasing the amount of available shares on the market and slowly but surely contributing to the incoming gamma squeeze.

# CLASS IS IN SESSION

**Have you wondered recently with reported Short Interest of GME so low (26% of float according to MarketBeat), how has GME gone down more than 100% in the past 5 days with relatively low volume?**

**Are fellow apes and long whales selling?** Answer: NO, look at the OBV

https://preview.redd.it/1j1j1o5z28p61.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=5716e84a0827912b0573db1fac8b46ab48876677

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting GME directly?** *YES*, but that alone is not enough to drive down GME price drastically without significant increase in reported short interest.

**Are Citadel and Friends hiding short interest thorough OTC (dark pools) and other shady options mechanisms?** *Likely yes*, but will not explore in this post.

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting ETFs directly that contain GME?** *YES*, but that’s not the entire picture

**Isn’t shorting an ETF that only contains 1-5% GME expensive and cost prohibitive?** 

*NO***,** and here’s why.

# Operational Shorting – Naked Shorting ETFs at a PROFIT for Citadel

**What Is an ETF?** An exchange traded fund (ETF) is like a basket of stocks that can be purchased or sold on an exchange like a single regular stock.

**Rise of ETFs** are concerning since they constitute a disproportionately high amount of US trading volume. 25% of all US equity trading volume, but only constitute 5% market cap.

**Why is there such a high ETF trading volume?** Answer: Its profitable for the APs

**What is an AP?** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF) like big banks or market makers like Citadel

**How does Citadel make money on selling / buying ETFs?**

**Arbitrage**. The buying and selling of securities in different markets or forms in order to take advantage of the differing prices of the same asset.

&#x200B;

**Arbitrage Analogy:**

Think of ETFs like XRT as a fruit basket, and the stocks they contain fruits. Say the XRT fruit basket was $6 and contained a banana (GME), orange, and apple. And individual bananas are $1, oranges are $2, and apples are $3.  The total cost of buying the fruits individually is the NAV (net asset value) which in this case is also $6. Citadel can make their own fruit baskets by buying individual fruits but they wouldn’t make too much money since the price of the fruit basket are usually similar to the NAV. In recent years Citadel and other APs have found a much more profitable strategy – Operational Shorting.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xbgahbnu38p61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a85ef438ab5b7535f10e981b6787f5ffea2a40

**Operational Shorting Analogy:**

Citadel has the ability to NAKED SELL nonexistent fruit baskets (XRT / IWM) at $6 but not deliver on them until 6 days later. Flooding the market with tons of promised fruit baskets can drive down the price of individual fruits (bananas went from $1 -> $0.5, oranges to $1.8, apples to $2.7), only to buy back the individual fruits 6 days later at a CHEAPER NAV and deliver those fruit baskets to you. That fruit basket that was delivered to buyers only cost Citadel (0.5 + 1.8 + 2.7 = $5) to make, netting them a cool $1 while also driving down the price of bananas by 50%.

&#x200B;

# Operational Shorting by Citadel

When faced with “excess buying” pressure for ETF shares, **the AP/MM can sell shares “naked” and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for “bona fide” market making)**

Market makers, often commercial banks or hedge funds, create ETFs for their issuers by buying the securities that the funds are supposed to represent. ***But they've discovered that they can make a predictable return by delaying the purchases and selling you nonexistent exchange-traded fund shares that they will create later***. These transactions are a form of shorting – Operational Shorting as coined by Richard Evans, Professor at the Darden School of Business.

&#x200B;

# Okay.. What does this mean for GME?

**Citadel is willing to NAKED SHORT ANY ETF containing GME**, and by extension the **ENTIRE MARKET** (will show later) to drive down the price of GME. 

https://preview.redd.it/fmcvf8th58p61.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0aaf95f29be4cd34b050883f8f3efefec40e2c8

# If Citadel Shorted ETFs to Drive Down GME Price, Why Did It Go Up Today?

SEC Rules that Citadel must deliver on naked ETF shorts by T+6 by buying back the underlying shares. Today lines up just under this restriction from the first time IWM was shorted on Mar 18.

https://preview.redd.it/s3g2vp5748p61.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=f538798a7a0ac6fb52ae6709604762b0c7b21907

# Conclusion

Findings from Evan’s paper on ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short-Selling or Operational Shorting? 

>If higher levels of FTDs spill over from one ETF to another within the same AP or across different APs with overlap in their ETF market making activities, **operational shorting could increase financial instability**. When we examine the impact of FTDs across different ETFs, **we find evidence consistent with this contagion-like effect**. Moreover, we also find that **APs that are closer to their maximum regulatory leverage limit are more likely to operationally short**. These results suggest ETF trading relies on an inter-connected network of liquidity providers which, at times, pursue positively correlated **trading strategies that can be detrimental to the overall market.**”

&#x200B;

**Additional Findings on Operational Shorting and Financial Linkages**

* APs who are operationally short in one ETF, are more likely to be operationally short in other ETFs for which they serve as an AP (intra-AP linkage)
   * Proof in point: Citadel began shorting XRT to drive down the price of GME in Feb, and more recently have shorted IWM to drive down the price of GME again
* A given AP has higher operational shorting when other APs have higher levels of operational shorting (inter-AP linkage)
   * Higher operational shorting by Citadel linked to higher operational shorting by other APs
* Looking at regulatory constraints on AP leverage, **we also find that the closer a firm is to its regulatory leverage limit, the higher levels of operational shorting.** **This is consistent with a contagion-like effect that could cause entire market instability.**

&#x200B;

# CITADEL AND FRIENDS FUCKED AND ON THE BRINK.

# UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.

# EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street’s institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don’t have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

“Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn’t have before,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. “It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.”

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It’s common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don’t typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter’s debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO “based on the access they get to that unique product,” he said.

“Individual investors don’t generate those types of revenues, therefore they don’t get access to the unique product,” Noto said. “The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.”

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a “reservation.” The app will alert them when it’s time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

md6n8s,,wallstreetbets,post,1616701504,"market manipulationMany people are aware that almost the entire OTC Market has been crashing in unison for the past month or so.  Now we may finally know why.  On February 18 and February 22, the Market Maker (MM) JANE appeared on 36 of the highest volume stocks in the OTC.  Some examples include OZSC, AITX, GAXY, TSNPD, AABB, ENZC, INKW, OPTI, NSAV, PVDG and WDLF.  Later that number increased to 78 stocks.  February 22 is also the same day that GME and AMC began trending upward again after a dip that lasted for a couple weeks.

Have you ever noticed that many of your big OTC stocks tend to follow the exact same price curves, dips, spikes and dumps at the same time?  This manipulation from JANE is why, and based on the timeline of JANE's appearance in these high volume OTC stocks, the evidence suggests that JANE is heavily manipulating the OTC downward using tactics of naked shorting, dark pool selling and Not-Held Orders in some connection with the fight against retail in GME and AMC.

Please check for yourself by going to https://www.otcmarkets.com/otc-link/broker-dealer-directory/JANE and selecting ""Common Stock"" from the ""Type"" drop down menu to view the list of stocks that JANE is in.  View the historical charts for many of these stocks and watch them follow the same patterns downward beginning February 22nd.

[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-334](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-334) **from here:**

&#x200B;

# Prevent fraud by give investors information they need

>*The reforms will allow advisers to provide investors with useful information as they choose among investment advisers and advisory services, subject to conditions that are reasonably designed to prevent fraud.* ***- paragraph 2***  
>  
>*This comprehensive framework for regulating advisers’ marketing communications recognizes the increasing use of electronic media and mobile communications and will serve to improve the quality of information available to investors* ***- paragraph 3***

**They want actual decent DD for investors and not low quality Motley Fool trash pretty much. Give investors numbers and not opinions.**

&#x200B;

# Misleading advertisements

>*Advertisements that include third-party ratings will be required to include specific disclosures to prevent them from being misleading.* ***- paragraph 4***  
>  
>*Making an untrue statement of a material fact, or omitting a material fact necessary to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading; -* ***under general prohibition***

**More or less they go on to say advisers need to display facts to the investors that hired them, they also go on about the normal disclaimers under media posts ""the author had no stonks at the time of writing"". Nothing crazy important here.**

&#x200B;

# SEC can request more from advisers

>*In connection with the marketing rule amendments and merger of the current advertising and cash solicitation rules, the Commission also adopted amendments to the books and records rule. In addition, the Commission amended Form ADV to require advisers to provide additional information regarding their marketing practices to help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and enforcement capabilities. -*  ***Amendments to the Books and Records Rule and Form ADV***

**This one is interesting, they aren't specific but the SEC wants more info from advisers and how they get investors to buy/sell stock. This will be interesting when they speak to the ones who are advising people to short AMC/GME when they are the most held stocks on multiple brokers.**

&#x200B;

# SEC will help them get used to the new system

>*In order to assist advisers with planning for compliance with this new rule, we encourage advisers to actively engage with Commission staff as questions arise in planning for implementation*.  **- What's Next - paragraph 2**

**Just proves farther that this is not some changes to rules that get ignored. The SEC wants to help advisors prepare for it and are offering assistance.**

&#x200B;

# Celebrities can endorse stonks

[https://www.vedderprice.com/sec-finalizes-updates-to-advertising-and-cash-solicitation-rules](https://www.vedderprice.com/sec-finalizes-updates-to-advertising-and-cash-solicitation-rules)

>*In perhaps the most stunning reversal of the prior advertising regime but consistent with the proposed rule, the Marketing Rule now permits the use of testimonials and endorsements in an advertisement provided the adviser complies with certain disclosure, oversight and disqualification provisions. We can only imagine the number of possible celebrity endorsements in the future.*

**Elon can do whatever**

>**Q: I understand that an adviser must comply with the amended adviser marketing rule with respect to its advertising and solicitation activities by the compliance date (November 4th, 2022), which is 18 months after the effective date of the rule. May an adviser choose to comply with some of the marketing rule requirements before the compliance date, but not comply with others?**  
>  
>**A:**  **No. An adviser may choose to comply with the amended marketing rule in its entirety any time starting on the effective date, May 4th, 2021**. Until an adviser transitions to the amended marketing rule, the adviser would continue to comply with the previous advertising and cash solicitation rules and look to the staff’s positions under those rules. The staff believes an adviser may not cease complying with the previous advertising rule and instead comply with the amended marketing rule but still rely on the previous cash solicitation rule. Advisers are reminded that they should review their compliance policies and procedures in light of regulatory developments, including the adoption of the amended marketing rule. In addition, the staff believes that when advisers transition to the amended marketing rule, they will need to implement any revisions to the written compliance policies and procedures necessary so that they are reasonably designed to prevent violations of the amended marketing rule. Advisers are also reminded that they are required to maintain a copy of all compliance policies and procedures in effect at any time within the previous five years, and that it should be clear when those policies and procedures were in effect.

If anything I wrote is misleading or incorrect please let me know in comments. If you want to dissect it farther and make comments that is why I made the post. Lets talk about it.

**TLDR-**

**Any celebrity can talk more freely about stocks.**

**They want less crappy media endorsement of stocks.**

**Financial advisers need to give clients all the facts when making investments for them.**

**SEC will be able to request more from advisers.**

**SEC rejects advisers attempt to push this to next year.**

**Advisers seem generally salty about all this.**

edit: If I spell advisor wrong anywhere here its because I originally spelled it advisor but SEC wrote adviser so I followed the SEC thinking its the correct way. Now I dont even know lol.",

I use a desktop program called ThinkOrSwim, it is completely free to open an account and you do NOT need to deposit anything to be able to use it.

You can set it up to scan specifically for pretty much any parameter you can think of. Ask, Bid, Volume, Implied Volatility, Days to expiry, Delta, Theta, you get the picture. I attached a picture below so you can get an idea. I use it to find super cheap options plays, and if I think it's a good deal and I believe the underlying will move in the way that will increase the price of my contract, I'll buy.

You can also use a stock scanner that they have to scan for stocks. Once again all of this is completely free to use! You can also get Free Level 2 (Google how to do this for ThinkOrSwim) to get real-time data. You have to go to the website and add it to your subscriptions in your Profile page or something along those lines.

mdfpkg,,wallstreetbets,post,1616729287,"The difference between short interest and short volume
There has been a good deal of discussion back and forth here on the topics of ""short interest"" and ""short volume.""  I thought it might be helpful to shed some light on the important distinction between these two.

 

Think of short interest as a ""photograph"" at a given point in time of the total number of shares held short as of that precise moment (most often, the end of a quarter or a month).

 

Think of short volume as a ""movie"" covering the activity of a trading day (or longer period), which captures on film the total number of shares shorted during that day.

 

And finally, think of the short volume percentage as the fraction that results from dividing the total number of shares shorted during that day by the total number of shares traded for that day.

 

The really critical point to understand here is that short volume for a given trading day or other period is not a number that can be added to existing short interest to derive the new short interest total.  The reason for that is that the short volume on any given day measures only the shares shorted and takes no account of the share trades made to close short positions.  Most typically, a very high percentage of short trades will be closed on the same day resulting in a short interest at the end of the day that is little changed from the short interest at the beginning of that day.

 

How and why does this happen?  Welcome to the world of HFT (high-frequency trading), where the bots hit the market with a staccato of relatively small trades, the net effect of which is to drive the SP down on moderately low volume.  At that point (or on closely following days), shares are purchased at the new, lower prices to close out the shorts.  So the net change in short interest is often very small even when the short volume is very large.",

mdfpkg,gs9xijp,wallstreetbets,comment,1616753668,"Yep. They were able to drive the SI reported value down by incorrectly reporting and closing some positions. Followed by resorting to ETF shorting combined with short share borrowing, ensuring to close those positions, which gave enough shares to suppress and drop the stock back under 100. But, you do enough of this and you start pissing off some other whales and inviting the ones in who want you to fail. Citadel has made some enemies.",

mdrags,,wallstreetbets,post,1616772950,"AMC - 500M Additional Shares DD and TheorySo I’ve been pondering why AMC would put out a proxy vote to add 500M additional and I have 3 working theories.

1. Increase Liquidity

I’ve had this thought brewing in my mind for some time and investopedia kind of confirmed it. If retailers and institutions own as many shares as I believe to be held which is relatively near the max outstanding shares available on the market, it has this effect.

Essentially a lack a liquidity or volume of available shares creates immense volatility. Think about it like a fault line in the earth, every time it shifts it creates an earthquake. It starts off on high wave fluctuation and then subsides.

When you have a lack of available shares, available sellers asks and new buyers bids will be farther apart. 

2. Ownership Concerns

So this theory builds on the idea that Wanda Group converted shares to Class A in order to sell them off. The day of March 19th we couldn’t break $14. I either thought manipulation, but one of my peers brought to my attention that if Wanda had sold all of its shares at that price it would roughly had the same effect. 

When Wanda sacrificed its Class B shares, it also sacrificed majority voting power. Essentially I don’t know who the hell controls the majority voting power, but I’m 90% sure it’s retail investors as a whole.

AMC might be trying to regain ownership with the additional 500M shares because that’s 51% of outstanding shares.

3. Additional Capital

AMC may see an opportunity to raise additional capital by selling additional shares with the current public interest in the stock. I don’t fault them for that, but it’s not good for us either way.

Conclusion 

These theories are all speculative, but I believe derived from decent 🦍 analysis. I voted no on just about everything in the proxy vote. Especially the additional 500M shares because that means dilution and the price will more than likely drop given the company’s current fundamentals.

This isn’t financial advice, just my own wrinkle free brain analysis.",

The 500m is just a VOTE. The simple act of voting forces all shares to get recounted, so all the fake shares need to get bought out of existence. This is what causes it to squeeze, dumb apes!

Nobody is stupid enough to dilute their own company in half! Especially during a covid era market when they know short sellers are out for blood.  When a shorted company goes bankrupt, short sellers don't need to return the shares AND they don't pay taxes on their profit.",
mdrags,gsawayg,wallstreetbets,comment,1616773214,Looks like the fun continues in my own smooth gorilla brained opinion. AMC is still one of the highest shorted stocks according to Yahoo finance. I too have been doing as much homework as I can access.,
mdrags,gsax3uo,wallstreetbets,comment,1616773565,"On point 2, in the proxy documents, they already stated that it is not for ownership, is that binding? No May they change their mind last second? Possible.  

IMHO, this is just to milk more money out of what the APES are doing and line their pockets. Reality is we are targeting the greater evil of the two. AMC giving MM bonuses when they hadn't even opened fully, shows the top always has a golden parachute.",

The current tally is:

* 37000 at $200
* 15000 at $250

Then there's [a big gap](https://optionsentiment.live/gme) all the way over to $690. You guys think it's going to start getting filled as we climb through? I know people have been bashing options around here (i own shares myself), but keep in mind, each of these contracts ties in 100 shares apiece, so you definitely want to see them move in your direction (not many apes can afford to buy up 100 share lots).

As to where we're going, market obsession with patterns means we \_have\_ to try the $375 resistance before all is said and done ( i believe a lot of people were getting ready to take profits there last time, so the whales front-ran everyone and dumped it 30 pts earlier -- classic whale stuff):

I've gone ahead and added the next resistances for you fine people. Expect profit taking /selling around there, highest predictable one is $485.

This is if the hedgies decide to play nice, which, well, probably not gonna happen :3
