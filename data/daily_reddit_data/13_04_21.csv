**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Coinbase is a direct public offering, which means shares trading on an exchange with no previously issued shares and everyone has access to the shares at the same time. This makes it more volatile than an IPO.

In addition to the $65 million in compensatory damages, the award includes $50 million in punitive damages for Walmart’s willful and malicious conduct.

mphtpx,,stocks,post,1618245876,"There's a reason why people tell you to only invest money you don't need in the foreseeable future.I've seen at least 2 post today on reddit of people claiming that they are gonna pull their money out of the stock market due to consistent losses. Most of their holding are stocks that were once popular on reddit and more than likely they bought at the very top of the hype but that's not here nor there. The fact is that if you invest money that you don't need any time soon you can just ride the wave of losses.

I'm personally living paycheck to paycheck and could definitely use the money I have invested but I keep trying to see that money as LOST already. Maybe not the greatest thing but I'm definitely not dependent on it and don't plan on using it anytime soon. There's a certain Game ticker that has lost me a ton of money these last 2 weeks and I haven't bat an eye because I'm not counting on that money. 

I know a lot of us have been and continue to be broke and when we hear people on reddit discussing a damn near certain winner you want to jump in and make some money. But the truth is most of the time it's either a Pump and Dump and more often than not these people are just wrong.

mpvhop,,stocks,post,1618289920,"BABA DD: It was never about a grudgeMost of the BABA DD and articles for that matter are shallow and simplistic. Here is the paraphrased narrative you hear over and over again:

>Jack Ma gave a speech where he bashed the centralized banking system in China. The CCP was pissed. So they stopped the ANT Ipo and opened an investigation into Alibaba, and created a draft of anti-monopoly regulations through [SAMR](https://en.nim.ac.cn/node/647). BABA's stock price plummeted. For a time, Ma disappeared and was feared dead. The communists in charge of the PRC don't tolerate free speech like Jack Ma's and they're teaching him - and others - a lesson. While he came-out alive, this has still all been a flex by the PRC on one guy.

This is reductive, simplistic, and a mildly [sinophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Chinese_sentiment).  I know; this is an investment sub, why tf are we talking about social justice shit? We're not. We're talking about blinders that can make you make bad investment decisions. If you look back a few months from now and realize part of your assumption about Chinese stocks is that the PRC is fundamentally irrational and anti-competitive because they love commie-ism so much and aren't as intelligent as their American counterparts...maybe its time to reflect on that shit and/or stick to stocks where your cable news geopolitics don't cloud your judgement.  

But I digress.

The series of anti-monopoly actions taken by SAMR since November have nothing to do with Jack Ma's speech. In fact, the cause and effect are backwards on that one - Ma heard a leak about the SAMR regulations that were coming and got all heated about it and gave that speech anyway. The regs caused the speech, the speech didn't cause the regs. Ma probably should've called-in sick and got drunk in his penthouse instead, mighta saved him some money but he's clearly a sassy lil fucker.

Alibaba has $1.3 trillion in assets and less than half of that in debt. They have 1 billion subscribers but lots of room to grow with a newly-formed world's biggest trade block in the pacific. They've been under 20 p/e for the last few months but rival amazon in size, scope, and product diversification. 

Did you think that the CCP was bad enough at judgement to blow it up because a little dude with a funny shaped head said some words they didn't like? I mean, don't you *have* to assume the CCP is pretty stupid to think that was going to happen? 

Economically, competitively, geopolitically - Alibaba's existence and *strength* is good for the PRC under almost any condition. Unless it fucks-up a trade deal, lets the US run roughshod over them in years of trade litigation, or is an actual debt time bomb. All of those things were at risk in November which is the true cause of the crackdown.

The 3 primary catalysts for the SAMR regs, ANT delay, and BABA investigation were:

1. Completion of the [RCEP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/juoce8/rcep/). (Link is to a post from 4 months ago when it passed)
2. Winning trade-war litigation v. the US via WTO [dispute settlement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_e.htm). (Remember most of this began days after Biden had won the election: thus, PRC knew that de-escalating the trade war and needing to defend trade law more meticulously would be a reality in a new administration).
3. ANT was printing loans and flipping them before they had time to count the money. It was a credit liquidity WMD and it needed to be corrected.

Quick DD on each catalyst that I should probably cite more but I'm not going to because I'm drunk and want to play video games soon:

# Completion of RCEP:  

Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is the largest trading block in the world, basically the includes the whole western pacific/SE asia region. China was making it a point to get this done before Biden got into office and could begin using soft power to repair alliances/partnerships throughout the pacific. Mango fucked-up a lot of US relations throughout the region and China didn't fuck around filling-in the void. RCEP also has conditional inclusion requirements for Australia and India, basically an offer neither can refuse but would naturally make them less dependent on the US for foreign investment. For the PRC, that's a smart fucking play and a shitburger for biden to eat. (See, this is how actual Machiavellian realpolitik shit allows one to make causal connections outside of ""Jack Ma said bad words CCP don't like, duh."") 

One of the many complexities of negotiating trade agreements is making sure all signatory countries' regulations on markets are fairly similar.

[I predicted months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmhx7d/forget_the_jack_ma_grudge_thing/) ago that BABA would gladly drop the ""pick 1 of 2"" rule as a part of the anti-monopoly stuff, get slapped on the wrist and that'd be about it. ANT would have to be a real bank too (that's below). I'm not fucking nostradamous, the rule just wouldn't make sense under RCEP.

1 of 2 makes a merchant pick **ONE** platform exclusively for distribution. The RCEP makes e-commerce, auto sales, everything equivalent in every members state. You can sell a blender with Indonesian and Chinese parts in Thailand without having to pay a differential tax/tariff/etc.

So with 1-of-2 *and* RCEP in place, Alibaba as a company would force companies in Indonesia NOT to use Sea Limited products? Why the fuck would that make sense? And what country in their right fucking mind would sign a trade agreement like that? Of course they had to drop that shit, it was an anti-competitive incubator law for Baba and other tech behemoths to grow. It worked, they're ready. Don't need the incubator any more. A couple weeks after the SAMR started huffing and puffing, the RCEP was done.

# TRADE WAR DE-ESCALATION:

The previous administration levied a lot of tariffs to initiate a trade war with China. They did tariffs back (called countervailing duties). This is why countries don't do trade wars that much, its a [shitty](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/08/07/more-pain-than-gain-how-the-us-china-trade-war-hurt-america/) outcome for everyone every time.

So basically Biden has to clean-up a big fucking no-win food fight that's been going on for years. Not biden himself, [this guy](https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials/juan-millan-austr) and a platoon of trade lawyer nerds. The problem is that the US used some fucking stupid excuses for levying tariffs, specifically the national security defense of steel/aluminum (spoiler alert: there aren't many ways the US could lose a war but running out of steel is NOT one of them), which are going to be hard to excuse in arbitration. And the trade rep from the PRC isn't going to give a fuk that there's a new US president: the US did what the US did. China can use the justification of ""national security"" for shielding itself from amazon/google etc. while sheltering the development of its tech behemoths through RCEP.

Arbitration through the WTO makes *theatrical self-regulation lucrative* for a country but destroying giant companies isn't. Every big free trade agreement is preceded by participants ""cleaning up their act"" (and not). It pays to bark at one's tech giants but not to bite. So the PRC needed to create the impression of due diligence, if not *over* diligence, to create legal fodder for their attorneys to de-escalate the trade war advantageously.

Plus there is a lot of synergy between RCEP and trade war de-escalation.

An important component for any attack on PRC trade policies for USTR will be that the RCEP is anti-competitive because it is exclusive. Those criticisms are hard to make when its a done deal. If the US wanted in, they should've have pushed for that before the deal's completion. China knew that mango couldn't see the chess game so there was no harm or hindrance to closing the deal ASAP after the US election was conclusive.

# ANT time bomb

Should cite. Won't cite. But ANT was writing loans like it was nothing and then flipping them by the millions to whatever venders for whatever price. ANT had no liability and was writing billions in loans. So there was actual credit market concern if the IPO wasn't held-up. SAMR is going to make them be a legit bank that needs backing for what they're writing.

Dropping the 1 of 2 thing and the slap-on-the-wrist fine is the 2nd to last thing.

Last thing will be SAMR giving an explicit green light (and maybe a date) to the Ant IPO. I'd say that will happen soon but I've been thinking that for months.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

China was never going to blow-up baba or ANT. They need to do a pose to complete RCEP and 'win' the trade war de-escalation with the US.

You're right China was already cracking down hard on predatory loans and Jack Ma felt that the crackdown was going to ruin his Ant Financial lending business so he went on the tirade. 

For the record I've seen some of Ant financials products and they do border on being very predatory loans especially towards students.

Today, I bought a lot of VTI, because I'm holding it for the long run.

CVEI would like to dig into a Canadian oil company called Cenovus energy, hear me out before bashing. I'm all for green energy but we're here to make money and I'm sharing my thoughts, looking for input as well. 

Cenovus announced the acquisition of Husky Energy in late October 2020, to create the third largest Canadian oil and natural gas producer. 
The transaction should be highly accretive and lead to substantial synergies, increased scale, more stable cash generation and reduced group leverage. 

Higher oil prices will allow Cenovus to reach its debt reduction target of $10-billion by year-end, removing the need to sell assets, but Mr. Pourbaix (CEO) said the company is continuing to sort its operations into core and non-core buckets.

#Standout points

* Price to book value is 0.7
* Breakeven at $36US WTI
* Annual synergies $1.2billion
* Cenovus will now have the biggest refining capacity in Canada, second biggest upgrader. 
* Oil production will be almost on par with Suncor. Going from around 450,000 BOE/d to over 750,000 BOE/D. Source: http://imgur.com/a/05ypaVc
* Cenovus is looking at $4billion USD in free funds flow. Source: http://imgur.com/a/uvY108p
* Cenovus has mentioned share buybacks and dividend increase.

#Saudi Arabia 

A finance ministry spokesman said the kingdom and OPEC+ have immediate and longer term views on maintaining stable oil prices ""for the benefit of all concerned"", and will continue to respond to global events and supply and demand issues in line with this objective.

Ratings agency Fitch expects a fiscal deficit of about $40 billion this year, assuming an average oil price of $59 a barrel, average oil production of 8.7 million barrels a day, and total spending of 1 trillion riyals.

The government would need prices of $76 per barrel to have a balanced budget this year, but under the current dividend policy, and as production recovers, the breakeven price could come down to around $60 a barrel, said Krisjanis Krustins, director in Fitch's sovereign team.

#Russia 

Putin a few years ago said a price of $60-$65 a barrel suited Moscow. Recently Russia would support broadly stable oil output by OPEC+ group of leading global oil producers in May

* We’re piloting methanol fuel cells at our conventional oil and gas operations to identify an efficient and reliable energy source to supplement solar power.  But what is a methanol fuel cell?
* A fuel cell works like a battery as an energy conversion device that turns hydrocarbons like methanol into electricity,” explains Ray Lambert, Emissions Management Engineer, Environmental Solutions & Systems at Cenovus Energy. “And the methanol fuel cells are being trialed as backup power for devices at several of our sites.”
Source: https://www.cenovus.com/news/our-stories/no-sunlight-no-problem-how-methanol-fuel-cells-can-help-us-reduce-our-emissions.html

* Cenovus's long-term ambition is to reach net zero emissions by 2050. This will require ongoing focus on technology solutions beyond those that are commercial and economic today. We continue to identify opportunities to participate in longer-term solutions to address emissions from our operations and beyond. This includes extensive collaboration efforts with our peers, academics, other industries and entrepreneurs from around the world.

*Between 2004 and 2019, Cenovus reduced the CO2 emissions intensity of its oil sands operations by about 30 percent.

*NOx emissions at our Christina Lake oil sands facility are about 50 percent below the regulatory threshold of 400 tonnes per year.

mpn2f3,,stocks,post,1618260652,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 12, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 12, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly even on Monday, with the market taking a breather after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recorded several fresh highs last week. Looking ahead, market participants will focus on the upcoming Quarter 1 earnings report slated to be released in the next weeks. Big banks are kicking off the earnings season starting Wednesday premarket. 

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

Year-to-date, the cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening sectors have broadly outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher last year. The first quarter of 2021 was defined by the rotation out of high-flying tech stocks and into companies poised to directly benefit from the reopening of the economy. However, now that Quarter 2 started, we are seeing the rotation back into growth and tech stocks, with mega-cap companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) driving the market to record levels. In our view, while we expect tech stocks to continue performing well, it is highly unlikely they replicate the outsized performance from 2020 and continue to look for opportunities in companies that were most affected by COVID and that are poised to benefit from the reopening of the economy. Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note “The initial reopening of the economy will trigger a huge rebound in margins across sectors which have been hit hardest by the COVID crisis. The unprecedented surge in households' cash balances over the past year – mostly due to the enforced drop in spending on services, augmented by stimulus payments – represents a potential wave of demand, while supply is constrained by business failures.”

**Highlights**

* The US government posted a March budget deficit of $660 billion amid the recent wave of fiscal spending, a record high for the month.
* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) jumped after the company paid a record anti-trust fine, with analysts calling the fine removal of overhang. ""Positively, Alibaba does not expect further investigations on this matter, and we believe the removal of this overhang could be a positive for shares,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler, who rates shares of Alibaba as a strong buy, wrote in a note Monday morning. 
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced Monday morning that it agreed to purchase artificial intelligence speech recognition company Nuance Communications (NUAN) in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, including Nuance's debt. The announcement confirmed earlier reporting of the deal over the weekend by Bloomberg. 
* Shares of United Airlines sank after the company provided a worse-than-expected outlook for upcoming Quarter 1 earnings.
* Gamestop (GME) is reportedly searching for a new CEO. 
* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) surged more than 5% after the company raised revenue outlook for the upcoming earnings report.  
* The virtual summit in the White House focusing on the global semiconductor shortage began today
* Electric vehicle startup Rivian, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motor (F) said on Monday that South Korean manufacturer Samsung SDI Co Limited would supply battery cells for its vehicles.

I’m on WeBull and they have a chart labeled Order Book - Level 2. This chart shows the current price (typically) in the center at the bottom, and then to the left and the right there is some sort of upwards sloping diagonal lines.

The right half of the chart seems to be sellers ask prices and the left side of the chart seems to be buyers bid prices. The y-axis seems to be volume of some sort displayed in thousands.

The only other numbers will be at the far left and the far right indicating some measure of potential bids and asks that maybe aren’t being filled, but are in the queue?

I can personally atest to this as I learned how to program and received a programming job as a direct result of one of these online courses. 

Here's what I know: 

- Coursera has diversified its income streams to include both direct to customer, enterprise business, and federal aid. 
- They added roughly 30.6 million users during the pandemic; while obviously this level of growth can not be maintained, i believe firmly that this will still lead to growth as a result of the 'network effect.

-They have not turned a profit yet, but their profits have grown from 184 million to 290 in 2020. However, other companies in the 'tech' industry also takes years before becoming profitable.

So, if you read the pages I've uploaded, I have a quick question about the advice given in said book.

So, Rule 1. A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a share the larger the rate of dividends and earnings.

Corollary to Rule 1. A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a share the longer an extraordinary growth rate is expected to last.

So taking these two rules into account. He also concluded that High P/E ratios are associated with high expected growth rates. Then we look at the graph and he says ""Suppose you were considering the purchase of a stock with an anticipated 5% growth rate and you knew that, on average, stonks with a 5% growth rate sold, like Merck (in graph), at 13 times earnings. If the stonk you were considering sold at a price-earnings multiple of 20, you might reject the idea of buying the stock in favor of one more reasonably priced in terms of current market norms.""

I don't understand how he came to that conclusion. Wouldn't the 5% stock with a price-earnings multiple of 20 mean it has a high expected growth rate and be a good stock to buy? I just... I got confused when I read this. If someone can explain it to me in a simpler format I'd greatly appreciate it.",['MRK']
mq4mi4,gudr0g8,stocks,comment,1618328513,"The way he worded it is weird and in this post at least it’s hard to map Rule 1 and its corollary to his conclusion. Basically, this is a math equation and the variable you’re looking for was already in the equation.

It had a 5% anticipated growth rate. You *already* know the growth rate. It is 5%. Its P/E ratio is already factored in, it’s just a higher P/E than stocks with similar growth rates. P/E isn’t the only factor for determining growth rate. 

So this stock has a 5% anticipated growth rate with a higher than average P/E ratio for that rate. Looping back to rule 1, the P/E ratio indicates that the earnings are low for the price. 

That’s how I interpreted this at least. Does that make sense? The growth rate in the example was already set at 5%.",

mpsbtf,,stocks,post,1618277868,"Virgin Galactic. 🍒Today the stock reached a recent low, the mid 20s, by recent I mean within a 2 month time lapse. This is a volatile stock that weeks ago reached a high of 60 when the company promised a test flight, now it promises to try again later this month.

The bear case is that history will repeat itself and another cancellation to a test flight will take place. It’s not just that this company isn’t ready, it’s that it breaks promises, from its CEOs mouth, to the lack of commitment from Chamath, to the minimal posts placed by its social accounts. VG has built a reputation of lying, hiding, and postponing. As it continues to burn through cash, it’s competitors inch ever closer to offering a similar experience, making us wonder if VG will ever take off or if it will become an example, a premature predecessor to an new industry sector. Should the company not be ready for flight in the near future, many feel as if it will not be worth holding in the short term, and numerical suggestions leaves you wondering if the revenue will be sufficient to pay off losses unless a significant price drop in services occurs. In that case, the gains this stock can generate don’t hold up to the patience and expectations held by current investors, not since the 1950s has anyone been content with a yearly under-double-digit stock gain... but I digress..

Enter the bull case...VG hasn’t had an accident in ages, despite it’s elongated pause and minor glitches the company stays committed to ensuring high safety. Confidence is shown in its operations by the rollout of a new plane model, building towards a new fleet of vehicles. Hiring continues and building of its experience offering grows. For retail investors, a pattern of increase in price before its test flight is written on your forehead as well as the blackboard, you have T-minus 19 days for it to reach another high point in case of swing trade. Then, enter Cathie Wood, (you’ve probably never heard of her, let’s just say she’s kinda smart), she buys the stock at the recent lows....spoiler alert, this is a sign that the stock is undervalued, got it bucko? Besides the possible swing trade to take advantage of there is the chance that the test flight succeeds and VG begins to see the “finish line” and we enter a fucking NEW ERA, Branson breaks into tears(again) and the roaring twenties literally begin with SPCE.

So, I didn’t come here to give suggestions for shopping, it’s just a stock I have taken attention to, your choices are yours.

*NOTE: In an era with pent up demand for travel of any kind, VG isn’t rushing what can’t be rushed. Boeing is having planes grounded for different reasons every month, SpaceX is making it rain metal in boca chica, Blue Origin might as well not exist, ... VG continues without explosions, without major recalls, yet gets criticism without comparison.

*NOTE: the unofficial slogan for this company is “Ain’t nobody else doing it with planes”, appointed by it’s retail investors and enthusiasts. 

NOTE: Virgin Orbit stock is set to premiere in roughly a year.

If you stick to broad index funds like VTI, funds that track the S&P 500, you’re not “risking it all”—historically, a drop of 30-50% is the worst it’s gotten, and markets have bounced back in a decade or less. So the rare black swan event downside isn’t going zero and losses won’t be permanent. 

On the flip side, the market has gone up on average 10% a year over the last century. There will be down years and flat years, but historically, businesses have grown, peoples lives have improved, economies have stabilized and innovation has consistently driven growth.

mpyvqi,,stocks,post,1618306659,"(KGC) Kinross Gold AGM upcoming - Discussion on voting rightsDisclosure: I hold 50 KGC stocks and plan on buying about 50 more.

Hi fellow investors,

This post is intended to try and get some attention from other investors holding KGC and try to pool our resources in assessing the upcoming matters for votes at the AGM planned for the 10th of May 2021. Voting deadline is also the 10th of May 2021.

For those who received the voting ballot the main points are:

1. Election of directors (For/Withhold)
2. Appointment of auditor (For/Withhold)
3. Confirmation of shareholder rights plan (For/Against)
4. Executive compensation (For/Against)

&#x200B;

My main concern is regarding the duration of their current auditor KPMG. Looking back at the annual reports so far it looks like they've been the auditors since the first available one from 2005. I've worked in the audit industry for about 5 years (different industry and continent though so not trying to push my employer, couldn't care less who audits them as long as they have the resources) and from my experience and reading a lot about issues from auditors staying on too long this could lead to some conflict of interest and lack of oversight. From an operational perspective, this often manifests in the form, that since KPMG has been auditing them for 16 years they might not pay as much attention to things that have been already signed-off on in previous years (since they don't want to raise doubt about their previous opinions).

IMO KGCs performance has been good and I'm very satisfied with their management, quality of reporting and financial performance but having 15 years without auditor rotation is a classic red-flag and having a different firm every (at least) 7-10 years is important for providing assurance that there is nothing being missed by the auditor that has been building up over years. This would help me rest easy knowing that two different sets of audit firms come to the same decision on the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements

I think if others agree we can try and bring some attention to this topic and vote in accord.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to others thoughts on this!

If enough people agree with me on this issue I would draft an open letter to management, the advisors and other investors to circulate. However it would be relevant to identify how many other shareholders agree with this sentiment and how many voting rights they hold. In the end we'll have to convince the large investors of this however I think the demand is fairly sound.

mpmvbl,,stocks,post,1618260085,"3x Leveraged ETFsReposting a prior comment about QQQ vs TQQQ, because there seems to be a question about this most days. This applies to every 3x leveraged ETF. These are a few hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the risks and the underperformance over time, and why the leveraged ETFs are ""not designed to be held long term.""

Let's say there's a crash and QQQ drops 30%. For QQQ to recover to its original price, it needs to gain about 43%. Let's say, for simplicity, even though this is incredibly unlikely, QQQ drops 30% in one day and gains 43% the next day. Now TQQQ drops 90% the first day and gains 129% the second day. The 129% gain sounds great, but it's on such a small number after the 90% loss that after the two days, QQQ is sitting at 100% of its original value, and TQQQ is sitting at a measly 22.9% of its original value 😞 No good!

Every time there's a direction reversal in the index, the 3x leveraged index loses a little performance. Because the gains are always on a smaller number than the losses. Not so drastic as in the crash scenario. But you end up underperforming over time on average.

Actually, in a string of consecutive gaining days, the leveraged index does better than 3x. Say QQQ gains 5% two days in a row (using big numbers again to magnify effects). Then it's up 10.25% after two days. TQQQ gained 15% on each of those two days, and is up 32.25%. That's actually a little more than 3 times 10.25%! But on average, in the real world markets, the underperformance from changing direction tends to dwarf the overperformance from consecutive green days.

TLDR: 3x leveraged index ETFs might do really well, but they also carry more risk, and tend to give less than 3x profit over time.",
mpmvbl,gub491p,stocks,comment,1618267565,"Someone posted something the other day about setting a % trailing stop loss on TQQQ positions to minimize the drops, then reinvesting when the volatility calms down a bit.

mpmvbl,gucepo9,stocks,comment,1618295071,"I have read all these kinds of threads enough, it's all 'been there, done that'. 

The simple fact of the matter is there are 2 scenarios where TQQQ will be fucked - a real crash that took years to recover, and the market trading sideways for a long time. All other scenarios, TQQQ will be better than normal QQQ if you got the balls to hold through and have dry powder to add at the bottom of the correction. 

The market seems extremely unstable right now but honestly I'm willing to take that risk. It's not a set-and-forget investment like VOO/VTI, in the end it's just simply more risk, more return. You can absolutely hold this long term but you need to watch for those 2 scenarios that TQQQ will die.",

mpsa74,,stocks,post,1618277712,"Maxeon Technologies - 10 YearsHi all! I'm here today to talk about Maxeon Solar Technologies, and to gather some other opinions on it.

A few months ago I heard about Maxeon. I read up on it and liked what I saw enough to invest a small amount. At one point the stock had appreciated in value by 180% - however, due to the fact that I had already decided to hold onto it for at least the next few years, I didn't sell. It's now almost back at the price I first purchased it. I'm not hugely bothered, as I do think in the coming years it has a good chance of bouncing back. If I see a stock rise that high in such a short time, maybe next time I'll sell some.

Anyway, what's everyone's thoughts about it becoming a possible big player in the solar industry? I'm aware its financials aren't currently the best, but I'm still hopeful. I'm the only person I know who's into investing/stocks, so I don't have anyone to discuss this with.

As with many people who've invested in speculative tech, I've recently taken quite a hit to my portfolio, down 32% from my absolute peak in mid February. That's still up 33% since last November, so whilst I'm a little sad, the big picture really isn't that bad for me. If anyone has any stocks they're particularly bullish on, let me know - I'm going to completely re-organize my short term/swing trade portfolio into longer term holds now that the explosive growth phase seems to be faltering.

mpsa74,gubuyhz,stocks,comment,1618281578,"I’m in a similar boat - down 50% from all time highs but up more than 100% from October (plenty of time left for the that to change though). 

I really like Maxeon. They make some of the best panels, and have worldwide distribution. Their revenues are strong as well. They reported Q4 from 2020 late, and while they did very well on earnings per share (beating estimates by quite a bit, 0.11 vs -1.1), and beat on revenue, their guidance for Q1 was poor because of coronavirus lockdowns in Europe. Their stock has slid 30% or so this week, which to me seems an overreaction given the sunnier EPS. That said, perhaps it is overvalued in the first place and is regressing to the mean faster than the rest of the industry. 

I don’t think this will bounce back fast, though I think the haircut is much more than is warranted by the data. I would recommend carefully buying in small bits. Green energy as a whole is still in free fall, and I don’t know what the bottom is or how far we are from it.",

mppgk6,gub78q1,stocks,comment,1618269121,"In general I first look for themes. When I find a theme I start looking at the sector/market. Identify the players, both public and private and proceed to eliminate targets, select ones that are at first glance interesting. When you finally find 1 or more start looking at their finances, management, opinion of whatever stakeholders and on and on and finally have a target:s that fits your theme and isn’t a bad investment, start buying in blocks, average up or down over time so you don’t go all in at once. 

As for losing money, even the best investments can behave badly at times. If you did your homework however, if and when it does do perform badly you can ask yourself simply “has the story changed?” Did the theme fall apart? If not, did the company change in a way it cannot fulfill the theme? If not, buy more. Is it a long term investment then let me tell you a secret to success, you always want to buy something good at a discount, so buy more because if the fundamentals are there then eventually it will work out. You can always eliminate any stocks if you feel they have too much debt to further minimize your risk.

But do diversify, because there are always “acts of god” Now if you have 10 great investments or themes anyway, you should be fine even with pandemics and whatever, by diversification I mean try to have as little correlation between them as possible, don’t go buying all the FAANG or all a bunch of different EV stocks. Be creative and you should have no problem finding more than 1 theme.

My methods are, loosely: 

-Get idea about company or sector

-Investigate on Yahoo and Fidelity the basic valuations of the companies in the sector I'm interested in

-If this superficial analysis suggests further analysis, I grab the last 5 years of quarterly reports and tabulate income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows in Excel. I also grab 1 or 2 top competitors for reference.

-Analyze the data. If the company looks undervalued, I try to go about guessing what I figure it ought to be worth with three guesses: A pessimistic guess, and optimistic guess, and a conservative guess. If the guesses suggest minimal risk and a worthwhile potential for gains, I make a decision from there.","['BEN', 'SPGI']"
mppgk6,gubn5lt,stocks,comment,1618277429,"hedge funder here. 

The type of DD you need depends on what kind of return you are trying to extract from the market. Like if you want to be an active investor, what edge do you have over a professional at say Vanguard Value Fund or XYZ Co Growth Fund? For most people, there is no edge, so you should focus on investing in who you think are the best managers (and rotate through that).

&#x200B;

However, say you 1) want to build an edge or 2) just enjoy being in the market, then you should really focus on understanding what drives returns. Broadly speaking, for equity investments, the value of a security is equal to the sum of all future cash flows discounted back to present value. This means a stock price is based upon 1) forecasts of future cash flows and 2) forecasts of future discount rates. 

If you want to ""invest"" (e.g. time horizon on a single stock is 1-5+ years) then really focus on finding companies that you think have higher-than-average growth potential, and then invest in a portfolio of them. 

&#x200B;

Your due diligence for such an investment strategy will focus on 1) ensuring that your portfolio co's actually do have a TAM that is meaningful/viable products/competent management team/etc., 2) that you are buying them at a fair value (e.g. stock price is trading below the present value of your estimated future cash flows), and 3) that you are monitoring them for major updates to ensure they are not diverging from your thesis over time.

&#x200B;

* KeyBanc has turned its attention to the videogame sector via some insights in its consumer survey and first look data.
* And  the bank is seeing a further shift into digital downloads vs. physical,  with the figure cresting 50% for the first time in KeyBanc's survey.
* It's also noting a bit of an engagement decrease, though a high percentage of identified gamers are still present in the survey.
* And among sector names, KeyBanc continues to favor Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:**ATVI**),  expecting its franchise strategy will continue to play out through more  of the company's premium franchises. It has a $120 price target,  implying 25% upside in the shares.
* Among other names it's highlighting, KeyBanc thinks Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:**EA**)  makes for an interesting value play, given its well-known sports  franchise and recent acquisitions (including deals to acquire  Codemasters and Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:**GLUU**)). It has a $165 price target, implying 17% upside.
* And Zynga (NASDAQ:**ZNGA**)  is expanding its margins and looking at longer-term growth  opportunities that will also be margin accretive, KeyBanc notes. It also  highlights a busy pipeline, with three near games coming this year. A  $13.50 price target there, implying 26% upside.
* Turning to the concept of subscriptions, KeyBanc takes up the idea of a potential response from PlayStation maker Sony (NYSE:**SONY**) to the strong success of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:**MSFT**) Xbox Game Pass - the offering that recently reached 18M subscribers.
* David Jaffe, Sony veteran and creator of the game *God of War,* says  Sony is readying its answer. “*What I can tell you is I know they are  doing some stuff because I know people at Sony who have told me that  they are doing some stuff.* *There will be a response to Game Pass.*”
* Ultimately, KeyBanc says, subscriptions are a viable way for AAA publishers to monetize their catalogs.
* ""*As  frontline sales trail off for a new release and prices are cut, there's  likely a point where a presence on something like Xbox's Game Pass  makes a lot of sense,*"" the firm's Tyler Parker and Ashley Owens write.
* ""*With  that comes exposure to millions of gamers who may try the game via the  subscription and end up spending within the game via microtransactions.*""  (That may have been a key motivation behind Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:**TTWO**) adding Grand Theft Auto V to Game Pass in January.)
* ""*We  don't know the economics of a game being on a subscription, but the  user acquisition, follow-on microtransactions, and potential  follow-through to catalog purchase when/if the game leaves the  subscription likely amplify the opportunity,*"" they say.

mpzw8o,gucznr1,stocks,comment,1618314525,"Interesting article. Thank you for posting. 

MSFT is the clear front runner here and if they get Discord they could really shake up the gaming subscriber market. But they are just half of the gaming market; with SONY being the other half. 

SONY really needs to make some significant moves in this space if they want to keep up. The PlayStation obviously holds its own as an entertainment system but they need to keep expanding their PlayStation Network to keep relevant. 

TTWO is a goldmine with the GTA series, and it is still bringing in huge revenue for them. The next installment in the series (GTA VI) will surely bring in about the same as the previous installment ($6B). Just give some more love to your other titles here would ya?

EA needs to reel-in, consolidate or cancel their chaotic and often lackluster EA Play service. If they want to grow, stay relevant and not loose more subscribers. What they did get right and rightfully got a big boost in players for is partnering with XBOX Gamepass. Traditionally EA would just buy other studios with great new releases and bring them under their EA umbrella. This has historically not been popular with the players, as the studios ultimately loose control over the nuances which made them successful in the first place. 

ATVI has a hardcore fan base and many very successful gaming franchises to their name. The aforementioned fan base here are very loyal and not afraid to spend money on the older titles. But what the company really needs to do going forward is remove or restructure their destructive and at times incompetent upper management. Rehashing the slowly fading older titles just seems like a cheap way to make money fast. Ultimately a bad management decision going forward. When what they really should be doing instead is double down on the future and develop the next big RPG game. The talent within the company is immense but needs to be appreciated, listened to and given their own chance to shine. 

Ultimately MSFT and SONY will drive the digital gaming space forwards from here. The major game developing studios need to remove their own individual subscription services from their own rosters. Instead they should partner up and quickly join forces with XBOX’s GamePass and the PlayStation Network services. This way they can focus on developing more quality titles and in turn moving the sector as a whole forward. The in game monetization will always be there for studio revenue anyway.","['EA', 'TTWO', 'MSFT', 'ATVI']"
moy4cw,,stocks,post,1618171231,"Microsoft in talks to buy NuanceMicrosoft is in advanced talks to buy artificial intelligence and speech technology company Nuance Communications Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

The price being discussed could value Nuance at about $56 a share, though the terms may still change, one of the people said. That would give Nuance an equity value of about $16 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price would be a 23% premium to Friday’s close.

An agreement could be announced as soon as this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Talks are ongoing and the discussions could still fall apart.

First of all. I'm a rookie and I'm still learning the ropes.
I'm not asking if I did a good trade or what I should do next. I'm not even asking for advice.
I''m just trying to figure out the math on something that I cannot find online because I don't know what I should be looking for.

So here it goes:

I bought 118$ worth of SVRA @2.36$ couple weeks ago
The price started to decline.
Now SVRA is @1.78$
(Actually -25% on my investment right now)

This should've been a day/week trade but as I'm a rookie I'm still learning but now I'm holding the bag. 

I recently sold another stock with profit. 
So I now have 600$ to spend. 

What would happen if I spend 600$ or part of this money on SVRA at the price it is now?
Will this lower my average% loss on the previous trade, leveling out? Making it easier to break-even or even gain profit? 
How do I go and calculate this for myself so I don't need to bother you guys for advice?
I've tried using Position calculators but that doesn't tell me what I need to know. 

Can anyone explain how I can calculate this 'averaging' for next time if I'd want to do something like this?

I can provide additional details if that would be necessary.

Thank you

mplbrk,guagms3,stocks,comment,1618256453,"Buying at a lower price than your current cost/share will decrease your average cost. I’m sure there are calculators to determine your average, but I’m not sure what they are as I haven’t used them. To manually calculate your average you need to know each trade you made (cost/share and # shares purchased). 

In your example you have: 
50 shares @ 2.36 = $118 
plus your new trade (let’s say 50 shares @ $1.78)

So,
Total shares = 100 shares;  
Total cost basis = $207;  
New avg Cost/share = $2.07

07:59 AM EDT, 04/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Alibaba Group Holding's (BABA) US-listed shares rose 6% in premarket trading Monday after it received a penalty issued by China's State Administration for Market Regulation over the weekend.

mpejzs,gu9gld1,stocks,comment,1618240654,"There is a risk that the deal doesn’t go through. 

As a recent example in the Canadian market:

AC (Air Canada) had an agreement to buy Air Tranzat (TRZ) in early (pre-pandemic) 2020 announced in 2019 sometime. Then covid hit, and the purchase was delayed for several reasons (anti-competitive and pandemic). In mid/late 2020 the deal was then changed to a lower $/share, AC did reassure the deal was still on as long as the European Commission approves the deal. Fast forward a few days ago, the Commission did not approve the deal so the acquisition was called off. Prices somewhat tanked, but has been falling since covid. This might also be because TRZ did say that if the merger did not happen, the company might not survive. Overall the price of TRZ went from $17/share at its peak to now $4/share. 

TLDR; 
The news of an acquisition can be good, but if the deal does not go through, the prices will fall back to its prior state so there will be some risk. 

I think you can say that the difference between the price of today and the price of the deal is the margin at which people are willing to take on the risk of the deal going through.",

I have seen a lot of positive talk on Reddit about Walmart: $WMT, and was wondering why their German world-wide wholesale retailer Metro AG: $MTTWF (or B4B in Germany) isn’t being mentioned anywhere.

$MTTWF operates across 22 countries, it was spun-off from $MTTRY a few years ago and the stock has been falling ever since. It’s been trading side-ways lately so I’ve done some comparison and it looks like both $WMT is financially doing 20x better than $MTTWF (possibly due to business model diversity and dominating the US market). However, the market cap of $WMT is almost 100x that of $MTTWF

Assuming $WMT is trading at fair value today, doesn’t this entail that $MTTWF is massively undervalued (20% - 30% of fair value)?

I started trading right after March 2020’s dip, so I’m interested in hearing opinions from more experienced traders

I'll share my thoughts on my portfolio and it may give you some clarity or something you'd like to hear.

I am not thinking of selling anytime soon any of them. The gene editing stocks are a 10+ year hold. Palantir will be the new world order(joking, but I do think it will take over in the future.) MAXN is a newer solar spin off with abysmal financials so I'll wait until they look better, Solar is poised to grow very well in the coming years. FUBO is a gamble, i'll be completely honest. APPH is a cool company and I would like to see where it goes. Only down about 7% on APPH, and don't have so much that it doesn't worry me.

On WKHS I would say sell, but I'm biased towards HYLN. I do personally think that out of TSLA(hardly focuses on this sector), WKHS, HYLN, NKLA and other competitors in the trucking industry, that HYLN will be the winner because of their great battery tech and recent partnerships.

On the other hand if the market sees another correction like the NASDAQ had recently - and it will before end of summer, if not much earlier, or much worse, if you ask me - they will get crushed ever more. And they are currently trending down right?

If some SPAC you hold is back to the 10$ offering price, the downside is limited and you can hold it in hope they gain announcing a merger.
Consider the opportunity cost, and that the market is so glutted with SPACs many of them will fail to find a company to merge with, and others will settle for some crap business just to be done, and in the end the market may be fed up and not care anyway.

Maybe trim the rest, hold a small position to recoup some losses if they rebound.

To be specific,  

#### [The Esports Technologies platform will be a full suite of services and products that can be used to provide best in class esports betting experiences to customers and industry partners](https://esportstechnologies.com/technology/)

\^ you can find more about their main platform coming out on their website, as well as their prospectus, although I will say, there is not much info on two of their platforms (Esports games, & esports betting & trading exchange)

$EBET also has another platform known as Gogawi ([https://www.gogawi.us/](https://www.gogawi.us/)). The platform currently operates in the Asia/Pacific region. I don't have much on it, nor do I know anybody who uses it. I do know, however, that online gambling is rapidly growing, and alongside it, esports. 

*On their prospectus, EBET states that it supports other sports, not just esports.*

All the financials I am pulling up are going to be from the prospectus as well as Webull:

**Market Cap is $57 - 63 mill**

**Common Stock: 2,000,000**

**Outstanding Shares: 10,000,000**

**PPS =  $4.5 - $5.00** 

 **In the last 12 months, EBET had revenue of $169,444 and -$3.30 million in losses. Earnings per share was -$0.26.**

If they went public 6 months ago it could have been a nice fast speculation. Now the market is cooling off to random IPOs with little substance.

Just a promise that they will *try* to develop some kind of IP property that will give them a hedge in the business of esports betting. Note they don’t have the technology, they will try to develop it with your money.

That’s way too little. I get the impression that is too easy for a thousand more startups offering the same services to pop up, it doesn’t take a lot of funding and expertise.

mpjnsi,,stocks,post,1618251022,"Buying and selling a single stock, to learn?I’ve been in the stock market for about 6 months now. Life has been crazy busy for me lately and I wasn’t making good returns anyways so I withdrew everything except for $50. I figured I could let it sit until I felt like playing with it again. I’ve done quite a bit or research into swing trading and that’s definitely what I’d like to do. So my question is 

Is it a good idea to trade a stock of a company over and over again week to week? I figured doing this could allow me to dive deeper into some more fundamental aspects of stocks and maybe technicals I had missed. I’d be able to easily track news since I’d only need to follow the market as a whole and my specific stock.

The other way I thought of doing this was to just trade a single stock each week. Which is what I’m leaning towards most. Buy on monday/early week dip, sell when I get a good return or by the end of the week. The idea being to have cash at the end of each week. It would serve as a nice reset each week. It would be easy to look into the week and see why the trade went well or poorly. In the weekend I’d also be looking for the next stock.

Im curious how I should go about this, If I even should. I’d be playing with $50. Idc if I lose it all. The goal would be to learn as much as possible while cutting out anything unnecessary to making a single good trade. I don’t have time to screen stocks every day. I want something simple and effective. I’m not looking at this is me investing in the sense of a portfolio. The sole purpose is to learn. 

I figured I’d probably be safe going for large or medium cap stocks since they roll with the market more, but at the same time I’d like enough volatility to actually catch profit. I figure 5% is a reasonable thing to ask. 

Any information on this is appreciated.",

mpjnsi,guacnxf,stocks,comment,1618254709,"If it were possible to do this without investing much time or effort then everybody would be successful swing traders.

Pick a stock you like, for swing trading I usually like smaller cap stocks with relatively low shares issued, on a moderate upwards trend for the past 3 weeks.   Then assess the technicals around support and resistance, identify any channels you want to try to trade, then wait for your entry and enter.   Set your exit and stop loss when you enter using a bracket OCO.  Focus on losing less money per trade gone wrong, and use trailing stops if you see it going your way and it has potential to clear your originally planned price target.

A good candidate to start with might be BP, because all the smaller cap stuff has been blood red for weeks now.  It’s been trending generally green with good swings, but has a lot of shares issued and is obviously large cap.   Relatively safe to learn on.

You also need to identify which type of trades you’d like to focus on...  broadly you can trade momentum (using technical indicators), sentiment, or news and events.   This will help narrow the stock picks for you.   With q1 earnings coming out soon and it being a pretty red day in small cap you probably have a decent entry point.

Another easy one to swing trade is CRSR, very cyclical in nature though it’s been dropping off lately towards red.   You can make money swing trading a downturn but if you mess up you can’t hold and wait to recover.",

US infrastructure bill will likely disproportionately benefit TSLA. Right now, the old EV $7,500 is still available for all autos except TSLA & GM. Potential to be $10k credit, uncapped, which would be a boon to TSLA sales. They also are massively expanding SuperCharger networks & potentially opening up to all EV's, not just TSLA EV's. The infrastructure bill also has funding for charger networks. 2 big wins coming this year for TSLA on the incoming infrastructure bill alone. There also seems to be an emphasis on US manufactured EV's would only be eligible.

2 new gigafactories should go online this year (Texas & Berlin), doubling the manufacturing footprint and opening up a local manufacturer to cater to the European markets. Potential to build out a new gigafactory in India next.

2 new vehicle lines likely to be delivered by later year or by Q1 2021. Semi & CyberTruck. Semi's already have orders in the que, plus plans are in motion for the Megacharger network to support them.

Q1 2021 deliveries beat. Check out the YOY % increase. Also realize, no model S or X were delivered in Q1 due to the refresh. These are the higher margin cars so we should see the demand pushed to Q2 deliveries. I am bullish we may see 1M deliveries for this year.

You have a good cost basis on this to whether any storms though by holding it long. Plus we already seen capitulation occur with TSLA retracing to $550 from $800's. I've substantially increased TSLA's weight in my account recently on the dip, bought more after Q1 deliveries beat. But my thesis & conviction is my own.

mp3oad,gu8mwp6,stocks,comment,1618222975,"The problem with TSLA is the mindless fans who make disgusting claims of future valuation.

Yes, maybe TSLA increases EV sales but that ultimately means nothing due to slim profit margins.  It’s also worth noting that legacy auto is aggressively expanding into the EV space with VW already in position to become the market share leader.  Tesla interiors are also sub standard leaving them with no actual product for the “luxury” market.

Yes, maybe Tesla solar panels take off as more and more people add them to their homes.

Yes, maybe Tesla powerwall starts selling due to the concept of virtual power plants and distributed energy grids.

Both solar panels and power walls require a large sum of capital in order to even consider them.  Do you see individuals refinancing their homes in order to afford these additions?  Are new homes being built with them already installed?  The actual growth of these products are questionable - and at the current prices and the constant flux of “new breakthroughs” no one wants to be holding the bag on an outdated system especially due to their current cost.

Autonomous driving - this is the topic that kind of annoys me.  This idea that TSLA is just a few days from launching a self driving robo taxi service that is going to justify its current and future valuations.  It’s absurd on its face.  We are no where near close to this happening.  We very well may not even be there by 2030.  And frankly - with the way people treat an uber... you really think sending out unmanned taxis won’t be absolutely trashed?  Are you going to get in the self driving taxi that had some trash and used heroin needles and on the floors and dried cum on the seat left by the last passenger?  People have this tainted idea of how amazing things can be without realizing how shitty real life people actually make them.  And even if full autonomous driving happens - people mistakenly act like it solely benefits TSLA and no one else.

Elon - betting against Elon.  Elon made SpaceX and you see all the cool stuff they’re doing.  And?  SpaceX is an entirely independent company and has no actual impact on TSLA value.  SpaceX will eventually be its own public company as will Starlink.  Let’s stop pretending like SpaceX is some type of evidence of TSLA’s future success.",['TSLA']

An additional argument is that the chance that you will double your investment which is also maximaly possible goes to 1, of course you can make more money if you would for example buy and rebuy after every 10 percent gain which has a higher risk. But on a yearly basis you would surely outperform any index amirite?",['NDAQ']

Some info about me: I'm in my early 20's from Europe and recently got a new job where I can pick my own pension plan.

My dilemma is whether I should stick with the company pension plan or decide my allocation myself?

Going with their high risk 100% stocks plan the yearly fee ends up being around 1.3-1.4% incl admin costs.

I was thinking of just going 100% global index fund. Yearly fee would be around .8-.9% incl admin costs.

I have my own savings in funds from my own money. I really don't mind the pension and think this system will collapse before I retire, so I'm not counting on it.

But I would like to make the best possible outcome by picking the right plan. Is it a bad idea to go 100% international index? I just want to let them set and not think about them.

mpyftu,guctimd,investing,comment,1618309593,"Hello. I would like to get an advice about investing as a Russian resident.

1. I'm 31 years old, live in Russia - which has an effect on whole situation.
2. I work as developer. My monthly income is about 1400$, but I hope it will increase as it has been increasing before.
3. My main short-term objective is to save money, and buy a bigger house/apartment after 5-6 years.
4. I have some individual stocks right now: 2 AAPL, 1 ENPH, 2 XOM, 1 MSFT, 1 NEE, 2 PLTR, 1 TSM, 2 UAL, 1 DIS.

&#x200B;

The whole situation with my country makes any saving in local currency a joke. Even housing is not worth. In fact, with my current stocks I'm down 1% in general, but up 4% in my local currency.

There are sanctions on horizon, any time my president could do any shit, which would worsen situation for all the folks. So, I've chosen investing in world (not local) companies.

As a Russian resident I can't easily get access to a foreign broker. So, I'm pretty limited in available stocks and ETFs. My current broker is one of the 3 major Russian banks.

&#x200B;

**ETF or individual stocks?**

Maybe I should buy some ETFs, but again, which ones? There are not so much available for me - most of them are ruled by Russian banks. And I'm afraid they could collapse after sanctions or some other shit.

The only one which is semi-international is FinEx: FXUS, FXDE, FXWO and so on.

With individual stocks I'm more confident, because I'm an shareholder and present in all the required registries. So, I could restore access to my shares if something happens.

The price is less profit compared to ETF and more time spent on tracking companies.

&#x200B;

My current plan is to buy individual stocks regularly. I would chose companies from S&P500 and add some less reliable like ENPH, PLTR.

Short term plan is to buy: little oil (XOM), some cruise (like Carnival), more green energy (NEE), add no-tech companies like Walmart, McDonald's, Procter&Gamble. Also I was thinking about LHA.

So, I would like to diversify, but be more tech.","['MSFT', 'MCD', 'UAL', 'WMT', 'CCL', 'XOM', 'AAPL', 'ENPH', 'NEE', 'DIS', 'SPGI']"

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

Sorry for the paywall, I can’t get past the first part if anyone happens to have an account and can post the full article in the comments. 

As a young investor, this isn’t too encouraging. What do you think? Just looking to start a general discussion.",

1.) subscription management. Without Okta managing over 48 (YES, not a mistake) subscription applications on my corporate account, I would be totally lost.

2.) Identity management. Hackers/phishers are getting increasingly clever. I was expecting a package, and got a very legit looking from UPS saying that it was delayed and to confirm recipient info. Luckily I caught it but I can see this being a huge problem down the road.

mpr7hk,,investing,post,1618273875,"Canoo Inc. (GOEV) Due Diligence  


**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Tony serves as executive chairman and founded Solera Holdings a successful company that provides risk management, asset protection software, services to the automotive industry and property insurance. He has also served as chairman for multiple other companies including Sportradar Group,Aircraft Performance Group,RocketRoute Limited, global aviation services company, and  APG Avionics LLC.

**Mark Aikman**

Mark Serves as Chief Marketing Officer and he has nearly 20 years of experience including a decade at Daimler AG.

## Ulrich Kranz

Ulrich currently serves as CEO, and has worked with the company since 2017 as the company's CTO (chief technical officer). Since 1986 Ulrich has been involved in the car business holding various leadership positions at BMW AG and caused great innovation.

**Peter Savagian**

Peter Serves as the current CTO and has held multiple different leadership positions at companies including  Ampaire, Inc, Electrified Future,Faraday&Future Inc,Sibros Technologies,and General Motors Company. Which are all companies that have to do with automobiles, electric vehicles, or technology closely related to those categories.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

[Canoo had another no revenue Quarter ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter)

[Canoo’s deal with Hyundai](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter)[ seems to be dead.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter) 

My thoughts: I think that while the recent class action Lawsuit may cause some issues for the company Canoo has a unique product that could become popular, has enough cash to run the business for multiple years even if the release is delayed, and has good management that is in touch with the business Canoo is in.","['GM', 'DE']"

mpgnog,,investing,post,1618242555,"Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023. Mobileye is working with the startup Udelv to manufacture 35,000 delivery vehicles[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023)

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”",['INTC']

mprkx9,,investing,post,1618275211,"About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM ESTOn Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

We'll know Tuesday at 8:30 AM EST. It could be interesting.",
mprkx9,gucgqvb,investing,comment,1618296862,"I don't think it's clear what the market will do in either case.

Higher than expected -> buy because you'd rather hold assets? sell because you think the fed will ease off?

Lower than expected -> buy because you think the fed will continue to print? sell because cash isn't being devalued as everyone expects?

mprkx9,gud62bb,investing,comment,1618318523,"It was up .6% in March. What worries me so much about this is the powers that be (Powell, etc...) keep saying that they expect inflation to pick up this year, but they are sure it will be ""transitory"" or a short term thing, then it will just go away. I realize I don't know nearly as much as them, but doesn't inflation have a psychological effect, that feeds on itself? When people see prices rising quickly they change their behavior, which causes prices to rise more, etc...

mpllls,,investing,post,1618256463,"In-depth DD on Bio Stock Nearing Approval of Breakthrough Drug to Treat Depression: Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) 

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

In the short-term you might see some volatility or discrepancies but in the long-term, money follows where money is being made.

This is part of the efficient market framework that people are  so quick to dismiss. Can Tesla or Gamestop continue to have high valuations? Sure...but if they don't start making that expected future cash via increasing earnings and revenues, the market will let Elon Musk and Ryan Cohen know pretty quick.

This is why people like me always recommend a globally-diversified, low-cost index fund like VT. Money will flow wherever the cash is been made.

In 2021 the NFL is worth 5.7 billion dollars, all because from a few individuals has a dream and took a major gamble.

The  first real season play fpr SNPW is just about ready to just began for SNPW,

SNPW's  teams:

Medrecycler, Sun Pacific Power, Street Smart Outdoors, and   National Mechanical Group  (non glass  solar panels)  are just about done with their exhibition season and about ready  to play for real.

What the exhibition season has revealed so far about the  SNPW teams

\-  The Company’s subsidiary Medrecycler RI, Inc. continues to progress  through the regulatory process  for the approval to construct a 48,000  SF state-of-the-art pyrolysis  facility expected to process 70 tons of  medical waste per day. With approval and the completion of financing,  the project should be operational by the end of 2021

\-  One man who reviewed the tech of Medrecycler has enough faith in the   technology and business plan, that he sees fit to committed 17 MILLION   DOLLARS to buy all the Rhode Island bonds to finance the project.

\-  Many cities have shown faith in the LONG TERM VALUE of Street Smart  outdoor advertising to award them decade long contracts.  Street Smart  is expanding and adding new services to it;s product.  Geopath is  expected to support a strategy for expanding our market reach to  targeted advertisers in the OOH industry and  Atlas Transit Solutions to  collaborate on the development of a  high efficiency off grid digital  plug and play modular unit will  develop a new SMART Bus Shelter which  integrates a new software as a  service that enhances the commuters  experience while driving a new  unique and proprietary product offering

\-  The US Patient office after viewing the science  the technology   granted 5 patents o the Non-glass solar panels and the manufacturing  process for it.  UL certification for the non glass solar panels iare in  the process

\- Free agents were  signed to aid in the Durango Mexico Solar Farm team,  one a solar farm  developer the other a financial backer. Durango Mexico Solar Farm  project  currently undergoing a financial review with a selected EPC and  funding group. This partnership is targeting a financial closing and  the commencement of construction in 2021

As  the exhibition season winds down, we have a chance to evaluation what  type of play we expect to see once the real season begins.

Pre-season  tickets are cheap right now but prices will only go up once  the real season fully starts, and one  can only imagine what those tickets will be  worth after our first complete season and we get to the Super Bowl.

A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

mohir3,gu41cxk,investing,comment,1618110477,"The previous 10 years have been the best time to invest in real estate. You can just look for an inflation corrected price index to see the dramatic appreciation in the last decade following (and probably directly resulting from) the 2008 housing value crash. I remember wishing I could buy like mad in 2011, though I was in school with no income. 

I'm not sure now that properties are very expensive and don't cash flow nearly as well (or, usually at all) you can expect the same safe and robust returns. 

Though owning your own home is probably a safe expense to have regardless. The equity building process can be almost like constantly putting money in a bank account pegged to inflation. 
I bet ownership just kind of feels nice too. Especially if you are settling down and no longer want to move around and experience new places.  Probably a very freeing experience to have something that is totally yours.",

mo5ii4,gu1mw1u,investing,comment,1618064549,URNM - it is directly affected by the demand for uranium. It's also been doing consistently well over these last several weird weeks in the market,
mo5ii4,gu1sh4k,investing,comment,1618067465,"Nuclear power in Europe is currently declining, and I would expect it would continue to decline. There are a few nuclear reactors currently under construction in Europe (UK, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia) but they won't replace the reactors that will be closing.

However, nuclear power is growing in Asia, particularly in China and India. China is currently building a number of reactors, with plans to build many more in order to transition away from coal. Globally, nuclear energy accounts for about 10% of the energy mix and the IAEA projects that by 2050, it will account for somewhere between 6-12%.

Keep in mind that the construction of new reactors is very costly and takes a long time. Maybe there is a play there with reactor construction. The shorter term catalyst in the uranium market will be currently operating nuclear plants securing long-term contracts for supply. Prices have been depressed for a decade and continue to be below the global cost of production. Miners were slow to respond, and there was a lot of existing supply in national stockpiles that were being put into the market, but in the last few years production has been tapering off and is below global demand. At some point, power plants will have to step back into the market and sign multi-year deals to secure supply. Its worth noting as well that the cost of uranium is a pretty small part of the price of generating the power, so plants have plenty of room to pay more.

I would stick to ETFs to get broad sector coverage because it's hard to pick winners and losers. URNM was already mentioned, which is a good choice. My money is currently in URA, which is slightly more concentrated with a slightly lower fee. You're a little late to the game as money has already started to move back into the sector, but there still should be a lot of room for growth as demand picks up.

Edit: After reading a lot of the posts that have been made since I first posted, I would just like to add that this is supposed to be an investing subreddit. The OP didn't ask what you or your friends think about nuclear energy. Nor did he ask you to dream about a time when nuclear energy won't be necessary.

Nuclear power is in decline globally, but still accounts for a large part of the global power mix and is growing in some parts of the world. If you think it isn't ethical, then don't invest your money. Do I want to own Cameco stock in 100 years? No. Will I take the 60% I've made off it already, plus the potential upside of another 100% when uranium prices recover? Yes.

If you don't know about nuclear energy or uranium mining, you shouldn't talk about it on an investing sub. In 2 years, my investments in the uranium mining space have returned an average of 100%. I've sold a bit when prices peaked, but I'm still holding most because uranium prices still haven't recovered. Maybe we can start talking about how to make money, instead of whether fusion reactors are the future or whatever.",
modaz8,,investing,post,1618089578,"Assets Have Tanked at Two of the World’s Biggest Short Sellers**Short Selling is a Risky Business.** 

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”","['TSLA', 'TWTR']"

In theory it sounds like a great place to put a percentage of assets to reduce risk in a portfolio.  And right after a big crash when people look at the returns it seems even more prudent.  But deeper and deeper into a bull market, the lessons of the last crash are forgotten, the returns of such a fund look miserable compared to the general market, and people naturally pull their money out.   The nail in the coffin is bull markets are generally seven or eight years and bear markets are one or two.  It looks like a bad business model.",

mplsdj,,investing,post,1618257007,"S&P 500 Stutters After Hitting Fresh Record HighThe S&P 500 retreated from a fresh record high Monday, as falling technology stocks offset a rise in financials and consumer discretionary ahead of the start of quarterly earnings season this week.

The S&P 500 fell 0.12%, after hitting a record high of 4,130.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, or 86 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.44%.

Consumer discretionary and financials supported the broader market's move to record highs, with the latter coming under the spotlight as major banks report quarterly earnings this week.

Major Wall Street banks reporting include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Wall Street's outlook on quarterly earnings appears bullish, with cyclicals backed to show strong quarterly results.

""We anticipate S&P 500 Index earnings per share will grow by more than 30% this year with cyclical sectors such as industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, and financials leading the way,"" Wells Fargo said.

Energy stocks slipped on a retreat oil prices from session highs as investors weighed up the ongoing progress on vaccinations against ongoing Covid-19 restrictions that threaten energy demand.  

Technology started the week on the backfoot stifled by weakness in chip stocks and mixed trading among the Fab 5.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was higher.

Microsoft said it will buy speech-recognition firm Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) for $19.7 billion in a bid to boost its foray into healthcare.

""The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors at a time in which hospitals and doctors are embracing next generation AI capabilities from thought leaders such as Nuance,"" Wedbush said in a note.

In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was down 1% just days after the company urged 16 airline customers to ground its 737 Max jets, citing electrical issues. The issues, however, are not expected to cause major disruptions.

""Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note Friday.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped more than 3% after receiving an upgrade from Canaccord, citing a bullish outlook for the company's battery storage business.

Canaccord upgraded Tesla to buy from hold, and lifted its price on the company to $1,071 from $419 per share.","['MSFT', 'GS', 'NDAQ', 'BAC', 'TSLA', 'BA', 'JPM', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'DOW', 'SPGI', 'FB', 'GOOGL', 'WFC']"

mok1fb,,investing,post,1618114299,"$MHH - Value Stock in this market; my DDMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

mok0m1,,investing,post,1618114213,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",
mok0m1,gu4oqfr,investing,comment,1618128647,I think this is a version of a long-short alpha strategy (or whatever) but the flaw may be that those companies may be expensive to short if the market already thinks they’re losers. Also puts may not be available.,

mopsuv,,investing,post,1618142387,"The bear case for BABA (no news is bad news)The stock is down from ATHs for good reasons due to fundamental changes to the the risk profile of the company, and uncertainties regarding the potential for future success it may have moving forward. 

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

-	Investor sentiment remains unchanged.  No new “buzz-worthy” events are coming up and no recent company news that I see promises to serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest or inflows. 

So what’s changed? Anything?

Are these assumptions correct or did I miss something? What makes BABA an attractive investment to consider now, rather than a wait-and-see story which may or may not see upside in the near- to mid-term? Or should I assume this is a dead money play for the reasons stated above. 


TL:DR 

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent. Down to flat are the trends, so they’ll continue until they have reason not to. Opportunity cost says steer clear.",

mobt6t,,investing,post,1618084613,"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claimsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it has found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.",

In a globalized world, there is only so much you can do to abstract away negative ESG factors from the companies you invest in. The first line company itself can try to be socially conscious, but at some point their money is going to make its way back into unethical labor, environmental, and social practices. Do they need to ship products? Do they rely on paper? Do they use energy? Where are they sourcing their paper, pens, desks/furniture and other supplies? The world is just too intertwined to avoid having your money make its way back into the hands of companies with unethical practices, and anyone who thinks that they're making a difference by looking for ESG companies are kidding themselves.

I definitely think that we should all be trying to make the world a better, more ethical place, but I don't think this is a good avenue for making that change.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

mo6q8h,,investing,post,1618068257,"DD on Novartis (NVS), and their role in the treatment of opioid dependence disorderThis is my first DD post, so bear (or bull) with me 

(C+C appreciated, as I had a lot of fun researching and writing this) 

Stock Ticker: NVS

Market: NYSE 

Name: Novartis

Category; Pharmaceuticals

Why investigate this stock? 

With the opioid crisis and its ramifications coming into the media spotlight, there has been an increasing body of research into the use of suboxone for treatment of opioid dependence disorder (ODD). For those of you unfamiliar with suboxone, it is a combination of buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication acts as a partial opioid agonist, and the naloxone component helps prevent abuse. In toxicology and ""Medication Assisted Treatment"" circles, it is becoming favored over methadone due to decreased side effect profile and decreased potential for abuse. Recently, some states have significantly expanded training programs so providers can easily obtain an “X waiver”, which is a qualification required for a medical provider to prescribe suboxone. This suggests that it will be increasingly used in Emergency Departments to initiate ODD treatment, and it will see increasing use in the outpatient clinic setting. 

So why Novartis?

For those of you familiar with Suboxone’s history, it is actually made by the drug company Reckitt Benckiser. However, recently they authorized a generic version which is to be distributed by, you guessed it, Novartis (technically a subsidiary Sandoz, but all traded under the ticker NVS)

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:\~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior).

I’m not saying that generic suboxone is going to be “the next big thing”, however I think it will be mainstay of ODD treatment moving forward in the US given low cost, increasing ease of access, and low(er) side effect profile when compared to other medications for ODD. (Some of you may remember Vivitrol aka long acting Naltrexone, see the head to head vs suboxone here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext))

Now let’s look into some aspects of the stock itself. 

P/E Ratio: \~ 24 

S/p 500 P/E: \~ 34 

I like to look at the P/E ratio as a good starting point to see if the stock is over/under valued compared to its earnings. This can suggest the ability to weather downturns in a market that trends towards over-valuing stocks compared to their real world earnings. 

Next, the relative strength index (RSI). For those of you unfamiliar it is a momentum indicator (I have my own opinions on momentum investing, which I can talk about in a different post). Whether you fall on the side of a value investor or a momentum investor, I think it’s an interesting index to take a look at for any stock, and can help you “time” your purchase. **Remember, there is no end all be all market index.** Regardless, the RSI was developed in 1978 and evaluates price changes to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI is listed from 0-100, with a value < 30 suggesting that a stock is undervalued, and should be bought. A value > 70 suggests a stock is overvalued and should be sold. If you’re interested, take a look into how it is calculated to see why a higher RSI suggests overvalue. 

Anyways, the RSI of Novartis as of this post is 54.4, with a steady trend upwards since February. So what does that suggest? Basically that it is neither overbought or oversold, but has a trend towards being overbought, which doesn’t help us much. . 

Here’s a few good resources to check RSI on stocks you’re interested in: 

[https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab\_name=rsi](https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab_name=rsi)

Looking at the financials of NVS for Q4, they are reassuring. 

See here for financial stats, but they can easily be googled otherwise: 

[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo)

The company demonstrated strong Q4 performance, with increases in Revenue, Net Income, and Profit Margins. However, using the golden rule that **past performance is not indicative of future performance** (except when one takes advantage of specific aspects of momentum investing, again to be discussed in a later post), I would not recommend using financial performance metrics to guide purchases (especially in highly volatile markets), but they do give you a snapshot of the company’s current financial environment. 

Above I’m suggesting that generic suboxone will likely provide a value to the company overtime, as suboxone gains prominence in treatment of ODD. However, what else is NVS up to? 

COVID 19

No covid 19 therapeutics, however Novartis is assisting Pfizer and CureVac in production capacity. Specifically, they will be assisting in filling the vials. I don’t think this will contribute much financially, but it’s good PR, and lets face it good for human kind. 

Current Pharmaceuticals

Novartis is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, so I’m not going to go into an exhaustive list of their products. You can find them on the wikipedia page here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals)

However, many of their drugs have good staying power. Of note, they make Entresto, an Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibitor. For my renal nerds out there take a look at the mechanism, really awesome stuff.. There was a lot of buzz in the medical community about Entresto a few years back. This NEJM trial was huge, showing that the Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibition was superior to Enalapril in reducing risks of death and hospitalization. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor medication which has become a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077)

Digital Health

Novartis recently partnered with Science 37, who has developed an interesting system for virtual clinical trials. COVID 19 was a catalyst for digital health, and I think companies that provide telehealth platforms are going to continue to grow. Many patients love the telehealth option, and often opt for it over an in-person visit for many smaller medical issues/checkups. 

Clinical Trials 

As a large pharmaceutical company, Novartis has a well established clinical pipeline for research. I find that betting on the “next big thing” or breakthrough in therapy is typically a losing bet, especially because you have no idea what the results will be as molecular therapies and typical pharmaceuticals go through the rigorous phases of clinical trials. It is a better to bet on a company that has a lot of experience bringing products to market, with a large research pool to pull from. This article has a great table demonstrating the “success rates” of various drug classes coming to market: 

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:\~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate).

(Spoiler: It’s not good) 

Overall, NVS has demonstrated steady growth, and is a huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. They have a large pool of research and will be responsible for the generic version of Suboxone, which I believe will have a strong role in treatment of ODD moving forward in the opiate crisis. The technicals on NVS are pretty middle of the road, with a reassuring P/E ratio and a dead center RSI. I think it would be a good value investment in the long term, but short term gains may be difficult. 

Finally, what I think is appropriate for the end of all DD posts, is that this isn’t me telling you to buy or sell this stock. Rather, I’ve compiled some information about the company that should be a starting point for your own research and evaluation",['PFE']

mobmuc,,investing,post,1618084019,"Smith & Nephew (SNN) - Sports injury/hip-replacement play still over 20% discounted from CovidI don't regularly make posts about individual securities...actually this would be my first. I'm tired of daily DD posts on companies that are at ATH, so here's a mini-DD on one that is still heavily discounted from Covid. And of course...this is not investment advice, do your own due diligence.

Let's look at where they made their business in 2020:

- $1.9 billion in revenue in orthopedics: mainly knee implants, hip implants, & trauma devices.

- $1.3 billion in sports medicine

- $1.3 billion in wound management

So we have a company that makes most of their revenue in sports, injuries, and hip/knees. Literally all things that were put on halt due to Covid. As to be expected, 2020 was a terrible year for them, with revenue down 11.2% and EPS down 25%. They also under-performed all their larger peers (i.e. Striker, Zimmer Biomet) whom thanks to more diversified products were not hit as hard.

I believe most of their under-performance is due to events that are transitory:

- Decline in sports injuries due to Covid.

- Postponement of knee/hip surgeries due to Covid.

- Brexit (they are a UK company)

- Inability to effectively run their sales due to Covid & lockdowns.


Let's look at some headwinds that I think the market is not factoring in:

- They have actually increased their R&D budget by nearly 5% during Covid, while most other device companies are tightening.

- The UK is planning to increase corporate taxes to 25% in 2023, however they will have a temporary 130% super-deduction for plant/equipment through March 2023. Meanwhile, UK plans no change to their 13% credit on R&D. I believe SNN, a device manufacturer, will be an out-sized beneficent of this change in tax policy.

- Potential buyout opportunity from one of the larger device makers.

Finally, SNN's debt looks reasonable, and Price/Sales ratio is literally almost at the same spot it was in 2014/2015..a rarity in this market. And their revenue growth has slowly climbed from $3.8 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2019, only falling down to $4.5 billion in 2020. So 2020 was, other than a small drop in 2012, the only year they had a major decline in revenue.

If it's not clear by now I am long SNN. I purchased after Covid and planning for a long term hold...now I'm waiting for schools to re-open, sports to come back in full force, and for people to get injured again rather than sit at home in their bubble. It's only a matter of time before people are playing hockey, or recreational soccer.

**Wrestlemania 37** (WWE) is this weekend and returning with a live audience. One of the marquee matches: Big E vs Apollo Crews in a Nigerian Drum Fight. I don't know exactly what a Nigerian Drum Fight is, but I smell $$$ for the sports-injury device company Smith+Nephew.",['ZBH']

\-A soon to be named auto company is entering a deal with Arbe that will result in 300 million in sales for one model, and could account for 10x (3 billion) in sales for more models.

\-The auto company is likely a US company because it is described as “Western” while the OEM described next to this mystery Western company in the presentation is described as “European”(If it’s a Western and not European, it’s likely a US company) *(\*See investor presentation slide 22)*

\-Elon Musk is quoted in the Arbe investor presentation - “Lidar is doomed” (\*Agree or disagree with Musk feeling this way today, the company is making a point in their presentation about the value of their \~$100 radar on chip IP outperforming the Lidar tech that can costs $1,000’s)

\-Arbe is a “First Mover” and “Market Leader” in 4D imaging radar technology-(Slide 16). This positions them to be chosen first to take the place of traditional radars in the exact same slot that is already built in for radar use, but can now be used for 4D imaging radar chips.

# What new customer/company fits the description of the largest new deal?

**Customer description #1 -** It is “One of the largest automobile companies in the **world”** *(\*See the Arbe CEO’s merger webcast))*

**Customer description #2 -** It is a “Leading, Global, Western” company\*-(presumably not with a homebase in Europe for reasons described above\*\*\*)\*\* *(\*See Investor presentation slide 22)*

**Company that meets both descriptions** **=** One of the US’s “Big Three” -- **General Motors $GM, Ford $F, or Chrysler/Stellantis $STLA** *\*Although there are no guarantees that it will be one of these 3, there are not many other companies that fit both above descriptions given by Arbe*

# Who is Arbe Robotics / $ITAC and what do they do?

\-$ITAC recently merged with Arbe Robotics to create a publicly traded company

\-Their product is the first and only available long-range, 4D Imaging Radar (so little to no competition)

\-Their 4D Imaging Radar:

\>Is used in personal cars, trucking, delivery, industry, agriculture, mining, etc. \*(Primary / most profitable focus is the automotive industry)

\>Is needed for every level of vehicle autonomy (Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

\>Supposedly outperforms Lidar and Cameras, especially in fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and other poor conditions (see performance details below)

\>Fits in the same slot that current, old radars fit in, but their radar provides over 100x better quality, and a 4th dimension, allowing you to “see” objects in a new way

# Is Arbe’s technology a “disruptor” with a large market opportunity?

1. Qamcom’s CEO explains why Arbe’s technology is a disruptor that supersedes existing alternatives - “Choosing Arbe as a partner was an obvious choice since there is no other radar chipset solution on the market that is comparative,” said Johan Lassing, chief executive officer of Qamcom. “Traditional or contemporary radar solutions don’t solve the challenges that autonomous vehicles face. Arbe revolutionized radar by creating a sensor that provides a never-before-seen image which is close to the image that vision based sensors achieve that also has the properties of radar – Arbe’s 4D Imaging Radar Solution has the potential to be the primary sensor candidate for the sensor suite of any autonomous and semi-autonomous applications and next generation perception platforms.”
2. The CEO says their new 4D Visual Radar technology is designed to fit in the same spot as existing radars, making it immediately usable by auto companies[ ](https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/173-noam-arkind-arbe-robotics/id1353975287?i=1000501753796)
3. The 4D Imaging Radar is suitable for every level of vehicle autonomy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
4. Already has “key partnerships” with Nvidia, Valeo, Denso, and other reputable/large companies involving their radar-on-chip technology (\*See slide 9 of investor presentation)
5. The technology can be used outside of cars - e.g. mines, agriculture, trucking, delivery, more -[ ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/qamcom-will-bring-arbes-4d-imaging-radar-to-trucks-mines-and-farms/)
6. CEO claims their main competitor is Mobileye (\*Mobileye was bought out by Intel for $15 million). CEO claims Mobileye will have a chipset in 2025 that is similar to what Arbe already has today (\*See investor webcast link below)
7. Resolution and performance supersedes all existing radar technology[ ](https://www.embedded.com/imaging-radar-development-platform-offers-2k-resolution/)
8. The Arbe CEO explains their IP value “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""

\-The Arbe CEO says ""When Mobileye passed $300 million in revenue, the figure that we are expecting for 2025, Intel bought them for $15 billion.”

\-The Spac transaction values Arbe at a low $572 million enterprise value, implying only a 1.8x multiple on 2025 forecasted revenue and a 4.4x multiple on 2025 forecasted pro forma Adjusted EBITDA \*This presumably does not account for new or unexpected deals that may arise of the 10 auto companies they are currently in final stage talks with, or the company referred to as “one of the largest auto companies in the world”

\-ITAC/Arbe has a small, 7.7 million share public float which could move quickly when catalysts are revealed (\*Institutional elements of the non-public float include a PIPE paid for by respected “strong hand” institutional investors such as M&G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures, and Eyal Waldman-(founder and CEO of Mellanox Technologies $MLNX))

\-The institutional portion of the float is unlikely to sell - “What matters is not the price or the valuation at the time of the flotation, but in the long term; especially when the **holdings of all the existing shareholders are vested for at least a year**, so you don't sell in a hurry“[ ](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-has-more-unicorns-than-all-of-europe-1001366171)

# Summary

Arbe developed and patented a new type of 4D radar imaging technology that negates the need for expensive lidar and vastly improves existing camera/radar performance (over 100x better than existing radar). Arbe is the “first mover” in the market, with little to no competition. The new 4D imaging radar fits in the same slot in a car that the older radar technology uses, making the transition easy for auto companies. The total market for the product includes all Tiers of vehicles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The price was designed to be virtually the same as existing radars-($100 per unit, $150 for premium), and is drastically more affordable than paying $1,000’s for lidar. Arbe’s 4D radar vastly outperforms the more expensive Lidar in many conditions such as fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and more, making it indispensable for both ADAS and autonomous applications.

\*Value will be confirmed by catalyst/deals soon, as the CEO has many quotes describing deals they are signing to be publicized shortly (see above).

mo18p6,gu1m10u,investing,comment,1618064068,"I am in my mid-thirties, been investing since my late twenties in a Roth IRA with Vanguard, doing monthly (now weekly) buys of an appropriate Target Retirement Fund. It's 90% stocks, 10% bonds. 

I feel comfortable with a 100% stocks allocation at this point (still 30 years off from retirement) and am considering exchanging all my Target Retirement shares for VTSAX shares, which will hopefully do better for me in the long run (I would continue my weekly investments in VTSAX for the future).

 I am only nervous because it would be the largest single transaction I've ever made, so I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake!

1. My personal risk appetite aside, is there any reason not to do this?
2. Is there a specific time I should aim to do this? (It seems everything is at a high right now, but does it mean anything?)
3. I'm pretty sure there are no fees associated with an exchange like this. Is that true?

SIDE NOTE: I opened a SEP-IRA so I can contribute some of my small business (sole proprietorship) income to this, since I'll be maxing out my Roth IRA. Should I aim to contribute to a different fund (i.e. not whatever my Roth is contributing to)?

Say I buy $1k of $ABC, it goes up to $10k, and I sell it all. I owe taxes on $9k. Now I turn around and buy $10k of $DEF. It tanks, and I sell at $1k to break even. Do I still owe taxes on the $9k profit? Or do I owe taxes on $6k of that $9k profit (there's a $3k max loss deduction, no)?

Similarly, take the same situation but say I change my mind about selling, and buy back in the next day for the same price and amount of what I sold it for. It then tanks and I sell it for the exact same price and amount as I originally bought in for with that $1k. Do I owe taxes on any of that?

The current valuation of $10B dwarfs the $4B it was valued at in a private funding round in 2020, and at approximately $1B more than Beyond Meat. This is despite the fact that BYND brought in 400M in FY revenue compared to Impossible Meat's 150M estimated annual revenue.

The [Pi Cycle Top Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/) (warning - terrible on mobile) has historically been effective in picking out the timing of market cycle highs to within 3 days.
It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2.

Note: The multiple is of the price values of the 350DMA not the number of days.

For the past three market cycles, when the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking.

It is also interesting to note that 350 / 111 is 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. In fact, it is the closest we can get to Pi when dividing 350 by another whole number.

It once again demonstrates the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price action over long time frames. Though in this instance it does so with a high degree of accuracy over the past 7 years.

IMO, indicators like these are likely to be only coincidental, although, it’s past accuracy warrants it’s significance. It must be taken into account as well as all previous tops have been blow off tops rather than an Elliott wave ending diagonal (if bitcoin is topping right now). This discrepancy may reduce its accuracy.

However, [my own personal amateur TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/DAn0UXkz-Bitcoin-close-to-Macro-Top/) seems to share a bearish stance. (Note- TA is from early February but trend lines have not been broken so it is still relevant) [Sentiment](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/relative-unrealized-profit--loss/) also seems to be in the ballpark of previous macro tops. 

Having said this, I am only an amateur and i wouldn’t put much stock into my opinion. It is most likely flawed and history has shown it is incredibly hard to predict the pops of bubbles. I could easily see bitcoin exploding to 100k next week. I would not be surprised at all. I am just urging cautiousness, please be sure to set stop losses.",

mn8840,,investing,post,1617937608,"JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground)

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",['JPM']

Still, despite this, Naspers for years traded at a substantial discount. Mutual fund FPA Crescent tried a long Naspers short Tencent trade for a long time (just owning Tencent would have been a better idea.) In an attempt to narrow that discount, they spun out the Tencent stake and the other tech investments into Prosus, which (last I looked) still trades at a discount.

Prosus sold 2% and still owns around 28% of Tencent. Also, ""It also promised not to sell any further Tencent shares for at least the next three years."" (https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html)

Prosus is a tech investor. Prosus sells at a discount. This is simply some inevitable profit taking to raise money to buy back shares (in hopes of narrowing the discount) and/or looking for other new investments. I don't think it's anything even slightly dramatic.",

mn9mjt,,investing,post,1617942867,"[DD] Bull or Bear: Nano X Imaging (NNOX)General disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

---

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**
---

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

I would have a price target of NNOX at $50 (for the risk adverse) - $100 (if you truly believe).","['GOOGL', 'WAT']"

mn9mjt,gtxbw14,investing,comment,1617973082,">$40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX

This seems extremely expensive in the PACS/RIS space.

edit:
So, for folks who haven't worked in this industry, here's a normal radiology workflow:

1. Your doctor orders a study be done.
1. Scheduling dept creates a work order/appointment in their RIS (radiology information system). This is usually integrated into the HIS (hospital information system) of the Hospital that the DR is affiliated to/has admitting privileges to.
1. Patient shows up for their xray, so they get checked in on the RIS. 
1. Rad tech pulls up the work order on the RIS, preps the patient, and takes photos with the ""modality"" - what people in the industry call things like XRay machines, CT scanners, Ultrasound machines, nuke med machines, and so on. This is basically the ""camera takes photos"" portion. The modality is the camera. They produce photos that can either be printed to film (in the old days) or more likely get digitally transferred into a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System). This company makes cameras, basically. They don't make the photos, they don't make the photo album.
1. The study shows up for the radiologist to read in the PACS. They read it and dictate their findings in the PACS.
1. The dictation shows up in a worklist for a transcriptionist to transcribe into the medical record in the PACS or RIS.
1. The radiologist checks and approves the transcription in the PACS.
1. The study is made available to the requesting doctor with the findings, and the patient gets appropriate treatment.

So out of this entire multistep workflow, this company only seems to make the camera portion. This portion is not usually done as an ""as a service"" since these are huge $6-$8 figure machines, that can require tens of thousands to millions to even get installed. 

Support contracts may be based off of quantity of studies performed, but they're not charging 35% of dang price of every single study. That's absurd. There'd be no incentive to move away from plate + film printing since it would cost more in fees than it would in film doing things ""the old fashioned way"".

That makes me think they're trying to bundle in PACS functionality, but that's absolutely not a good thing. PACS systems are how you store the photos, and retrieve them for viewing, dictating readings, etc.

PACS systems often charge ingestion/storage/viewing fees to access the studies. But even then the pricing is absurd. The PACS system I personally ran charged a few dollars per study, scaling depending on the type (tiny nuke med studies were cheaper than massive mammo studies or gigantic multislice CT scans). XRays are near the low end of the requirements scale. They're just singular pictures, and there's usually only a handful of them. They aren't a ""hot ticket"", which would price them above the competition. 

So, maybe they're relying on the PACS to be *""that good""* - then you've got the issue with PACS/HIS/RIS systems being extremely sticky, and hospitals likely have one already. That means a huge burden to switch.

The medical arena has made it a standard of not having standards. This means any time you attempt to change something, you have to hire specialists called HL7 Programmers to re-implement the gateway systems that translate information between all of these disparate systems and standards. Yes - they made a standard out of the translation system between the standards, rather than implementing a single standard.

The overhead is so massive that many PACS/HIS/RIS vendors will literally give away the modalities and supporting ecosystems to entice customers to switch, figuring they can make it up on support contracts. Modalities like the one this company is making.

There's a massive moat here.

&#x200B;

We all know that gaming is growing and that it will be a good market to be in for the long term.  According to Grand View Research [The Video Game Market is Projected to grow at 12.9% CAGR from 2020-2027 and the Streaming market will have a CAGR of 20.4% over the same time period](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-gaming-market-size-worth-7-24-billion-by-2027--cagr-48-2-grand-view-research-inc-301220945.html#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Market%20%E2%80%93%20The%20global,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027). also, the [Gaming Headset market is projected to have a 7.5% CAGR from 2020-2026](https://www.wboc.com/story/43596299/gaming-headset-market-2021-is-estimated-to-clock-a-modest-cagr-of-75nbspduring-the-forecast-period-2021-2026-with-top-countries-data)  I am sure that there are other projections which are more than this and that there are others that there are less. However, I would argue even if the numbers are 10% instead of 12.9%, 17% instead of 20.4% and 6% instead of 7.5% that you would want to jump into this industry as it is going to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

Now a little background on [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)

&#x200B;

Turtle Beach was originally founded in the 1970s and their main goal was making sound software/hardware for musicians. In 2005, however, they decided to use their experience in engineering sound to create headsets for gamers and that has been what they have focused on since.  If you want more info on their history you can go [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Beach_Corporation)

&#x200B;

Now Turtle beach is  known for their gaming headsets - they have nearly half the market share in gaming headsets per their last earnings call [You can see the earnings call transcript here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411642-turtle-beach-corporation-hear-ceo-juergen-stark-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) in addition to this, however, they also own [Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/) and [Neat Microphones](https://www.neatmic.com/)

&#x200B;

So now that we have a little background on Turtle beach, I will give you the reasons that I think they are set up perfectly to capture this growing market and to grow in the years to come.

&#x200B;

The Financials:

[Yahoo finance financials for HEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEAR/financials/)

&#x200B;

2 things really stick out for me for Turtle beach when you compare them to the other companies in the industry: 1. their balance sheet and 2. their cost of revenue

If you look at the balance sheet you will see the have an objectively great balance sheet.  $167 in Current assets  - $47 million of which is Cash on hand and $78 Million in Current liabilities - almost all of which is short term payable and accrued expenses. The bottom line is **the company has $47 million in cash and $0 in debt**.  They also have a great gross profit - coming in at about 37% of revenue. which when compared to companies in their industry like Corsair who has a 27% gross profit %.

&#x200B;

Now is where I think people really miss out on Turtle Beach, everyone thinks they are still just a headset company, primarily for consoles - obviously their ticker  doesn't help this image, but they are expanding their foothold into the Computer parts and microphones aggressively.  Per the last earnings call: "" We will continue to expand our PC  gaming portfolio of headsets, keyboards, and mice. The additional  ROCCAT PC products we launched in the fall last year will be followed by  another wave of really exciting new PC gaming products this year. As  I've mentioned, our near-term goal is to create an incremental $100  million business in PC accessories and our longer-term goal is to lead  those PC gaming categories."" How do we know this is really what they are doing and not just simply something said to make investors happy? well if you go to Turtle Beach's website and look at the [Careers Page](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/careers/) you will see that one of the jobs is director of brand marketing - Roccat. This along with the news today that [Roccat just snagged a deal with LCS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turtle-beachs-roccat-pc-brand-123000929.html) tells me they will continue to grow this brand.

In addition to this Turtle beach is still being valued as a gaming headset company.  Look at their PE ratio - it's only 12.19 as of closing today.  Compare that to other players in the sector - Corsair at roughly 27, Logitech at roughly 20 and razer who doesn't turn a profit last I checked.  A PE of 12 for a company with no debt in an industry that will continue to grow is an amazing prospect - however their current valuation makes sense if you think they are simply making headsets which will have moderate growth in the years to come verses PC accessories.

I do want to mention some quick risks to Turtle beach as I think there are some which could very much derail the company:

1. My whole case for Turtle beach depends on them growing Roccat and Neat Microphone - either of these could fail and if that is the case they will have trouble growing at a good pace - compare this to the branding that Corsair, logitech, and Razer already have, and you have a company that should be trading at a lower PE ratio
2. Similar to above, they are a very concentrated company and the majority of their sales do come from headsets, that industry will not grow at an alarmingly fast rate, so that will stifle their growth if it cannot be addressed.
3. While the amount of cash they have for their company size is incredibly good, it is not an amazing amount of cash compared to companies like Logitech, who , if I did my math correctly, [has 1.3 Billion in cash on hand, enough to buyout Turtle Beach at their current market value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/balance-sheet?p=LOGI).
4. Following the above, In this industry moats are hard to find, while this is a good thing for the growth of Roccat, it is a dangerous thing for the Turtle Beach headsets
5. Finally, due to the company size, one or two poor moves could really derail the company, so that is something to keep in mind.

Overall I am very bullish on the company, this is not my most in depth DD (time has been tight to do a good write up), but I think I brought up most of my bull points.

Positions: Currently 46 @ an Average cost of 25.57.  I will continue to add more shares though throughout the year as I believe this company is undervalued and in a great position to grow.

mn4cq4,,investing,post,1617924396,"Hedging the Hedgefundie (UPRO & TMF)So I've been considering using a significant amount of my portfolio towards implementing Hedgefundie's 55/45 strategy: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007

&nbsp;

Basically, it is a buy and hold strategy where 3x leveraged S&P 500 UPRO and 3x leveraged 20-year bonds TMF are held 55 to 45 percent, but if we use options to hedge, you could change this allocation to favor UPRO more than TMF (70/30, 75/25, or even 100 UPRO)

&nbsp;

Right off the bat, there's a few concerns with this strategy. First, it is very volatile and depends on the SPY continuing to move steadily up. Many folks are speculating we're in a bubble that is bound to burst somewhat soon. 

&nbsp;

By far the biggest issue with this strategy is that a large drawdown in SPY could absolutely tank UPRO given that it is 3x leveraged. Last March, the fund went from ~$80 to ~$20 in just a couple of weeks, and only reached $80 again in January of this year.

&nbsp;

The inherent hedge of this strategy is in TMF as bonds are often negatively correlated to equities. During the same crash last year, TMF shot up from ~$31 to ~$47, and stayed above $40 for a good portion of the year.

&nbsp;

However, bonds increasing when the SPY decreases isn't a guarantee, so why wouldn't we hedge further by buying some puts on UPRO and TMF ~10% OTM dated a year or so out? This is particularly compelling with Volatility at a low-point at the moment. Puts at this price range for this far out would cost quite a bit, roughly 10% of total investment, but would limit max loss in the event of a major downturn to cost of puts + how far OTM the puts are (20% total).

&nbsp;

Should such a downturn occur, there's a couple things that could happen:

1) UPRO crashes, TMF goes up: in this case the gains from TMF will partially offset the losses in UPRO and you could exercise your put on UPRO and reinvest back in when the market starts to recover.

2) UPRO and TMF both crash: In this case you could exercise the puts and reinvest during the recovery. In the worst case scenario that the market doesn't recover (bear market) you would exercise your puts  and realize a 20% loss from initial investment.

&nbsp;

Given the potential returns of UPRO, it seems likely that it would be capable of generating some impressive returns, particularly if stock market is able to continue the bull-party for the rest of the year. Given the optimism around re-opening and the Fed's dovish monetary policy, this is a definite possibility. And if the market really does break? You could certainly do worse than 20% loss.

I'm sure I'm missing something about this, so before committing to this plan I was hoping to get some opinions. 

Thanks!

EDIT: The major concern I think with this, is the high cost of buying the puts. You would need for UPRO to gain 10% to break even on the puts within the next 288 days (for a Jan 21, 2022 expiration). Of course, this could possibly be mitigated a bit by selling covered calls on UPRO.",['SPGI']

mminfh,,investing,post,1617851206,"LARK seems like a good buyThis small regional bank has some nice things going for it. They’ve consistantly grown their business over the years. They’ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which won’t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition. It was one thing that worried me and caused me to email their investor relations, but fidelity just has a bad newsfeed because the company is so small.",

1. Revenue and profit have been growing for the last 5 years. Even during a pandemic.
2. Free cash flow has been growing for the last 5 years, too. 
3. Net Margin is high, not sure if this is normal for bank industry.
4. Still paying a good % of dividends

7. PE ratio at 6.40

Its 5-yr Av. FCF x 15 (conservative number) = **$186M**

And it''s currently being traded at **$124M** marketcap.

I like buying stock based on its free cash flow and this is a strong signal for me that they're undervalued, as long they have a healthy balance sheet.

The only thing that I don't like here is they keep issuing more shares, not crazy but slowly, which is normal for a micro-cap company. However, I stumbled down a post they started buying back their shares last year.

*""Landmark Bancorp Board Approves Stock Repurchase Program Of Up To An Aggregate Of 225,890 Shares Of Co""*

Based on its TTM Cashflow statement, they just bought $2,000,000 worth of shares.

I love a stock when they consider buying back their shares, imagine for a micro-cap company, because it's definitely a good sign that they value their shareholders. I love this practice from companies that are publicly traded.

I think I have enough signals to start a <1% position in my portfolio and just watch. I'll be cost-average if they're doing great. I think there's upside potential on this stock and have room to grow from acquisitions but I'm buying from its current cash flow at the moment.

Free cash flow is positive but it’s always worth paying attention to the Balance Sheet when it comes to banks (which is never that straight forward given the varying degrees of regulatory capital required), personally I like to have a decent buffer of Net Book Value v Market Cap as in a liquidation scenario the costs to collect/sell assets are going to eat into this buffer.

mminfh,gtta9d9,investing,comment,1617891696,"At first glance, this looks like a value play based on high level ratios, including P/B, but as they say, there's often more to the story than seems to be the case...

I'm just an average FP&A guy, not a superstar by any means... but what immediately stuck out to me in two seconds of looking at their financials is that the industry's Loan Loss Provision is 2.5 times that of LARK's, and on a micro cap, one small wave of defaults could put this company immediately underwater.

Consider that when BOA acquired Countrywide they discovered that a full third of Countrywide's loans were in default.  Countrywide's acquisition price was 2000 times larger than LARK's market cap.

I've got 20 years of experience in financial and data analytics, and even I don't feel confident in my valuation of banks because once you start getting into Level 2 and Level 3 assets, the valuations are so complicated that even some folks at Goldman couldn't tell you with accuracy what the bank is worth.

Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it’s not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn’t expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week’s 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

Some highlights: 

[Dimon's discussion of corporate citizenship](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#corporate-citizen)

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

>1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

mm65gx,gtqacmj,investing,comment,1617827158,"Really interesting passage here from Dimon w.r.t post 2008 banking regulation and it's impact on loans:

> To understand this in more specific terms, look at the chart above that shows, prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had $13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending (this is, in part, directly related to the new liquidity requirements) may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experienced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more had been lent, the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been faster. 

I haven't heard this brought up before but it's something worth considering.

Also regarding QE and deficit spending:

> If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quantitative easing (QE) and deficit spending averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period after the Great Recession did not result in higher GDP growth and possibly higher inflation. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 4%, which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%.

> And so why did all this QE not have the effect you would have thought? QE was never effectively tried prior to the Great Recession, and it is different from fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securities from security holders who tend to reinvest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset prices and creates some spending (through the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may have some inflationary effects, mostly on asset prices. But on the other hand, it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves, which is an input cost for businesses, and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement income). And finally, in this most recent round of QE, much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back as deposits at the Fed, not as loans.

Just in case anyone needed another explanation of why we aren't seeing massive amounts of inflation. 

In general there's a ton of good stuff in there, the COVID-19 section in particular regarding possible scenarios going forward, risks and some insight into the kind of acute liquidity events that cropped up last year and why we might be seeing them more frequently.",

I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

mm9ppe,,investing,post,1617823242,"Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sourcesBy Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.","['MS', 'XOM', 'AES']"

mmg62o,,investing,post,1617842616,"$BAOS - Baosheng Media - Recent IPO Play Extremely Undervalued and Primed to Make Moves in 2021**Background:**

Baosheng Media Group is a Chinese Online Marketing solution provider. It's main business model is connecting advertisers to online media. Managing marketing activities, advertising strategies, budgets, and ad optimization services.

**Growth:**

Baosheng Media Group has been steadily growing revenues seeing year over year increases from 2018 to 2019 of 10.5% from $16.16 million to $17.85 million. Securing long term contracts with many media moguls such as: Tiktok, Amazon, Ctrip, 360 finance and Youku.

**Future Growth:**

$BAOS ipo'ed in early February 2021, offering 6 million shares at a IPO price of $5 a share. Raising $30 million in proceeds which will be used for expanding the Company's business scale and building its network of leaders/acquiring employees.

China's digital marketing spending is rapidly growing, with 2021 forecasts expected to increase 20% from 2020. With expected annual growth of above 20% as companies are looking to more short-form video ads and social media ads.

$BAOS is looking to capitalize on this growth by utilizing funds to enter into new sections such as NFT marketing and into the crypto currency field. BAOS received backing and a $10million investment from Ebang $EBON in late March to develop a blockchain-based platform/NFT and crypto currency platform.

BAOS is looking to create a platform to buy and sell NFT related work and enter an exploding market. NFT's market cap grew 1785% from 2020 in early 2021 due to the NFT craze. With China leading the market in dollar volume and spending.

**Margins and Ratios: (competitor valuations)**

BAOS is a market leader when it comes to profitability and margins.

BAOS reported 9.5m and 11.16m in pretax income in 2018 and 2019.

Those are margins of 58.7% and 62.5% respectively for their years.

Return on equity: 43.2% vs market average of 4.78%

Return on assets: 13.27% vs market average of 1.27%

Their bottom line has been steadily improving year over year through developing efficiencies and capitalizing on market trends.

**BAOS:**

Market Cap: 172M

Revenue: 17.8M

Earnings per share of 0.4

Price to earnings of: 14.72

Net profit: 10.8M

Cash on Hand: 51M

**SRAX:**

Market Cap:115M

Earnings per share of (0.69)

Price to earnings: N/A

Revenues: 8.6M

Net Loss: (14.6M)

Cash on Hand:9M

**IZEA:**

Market Cap: 270M

Revenue: 18.3M

Earnings per share of (0.248)

Net Loss: (10.2M)

Cash on hand: 33M

**Comparatives;**

As you can see BAOS is deeply undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few small cap marketing companies that are operating at a profit (62.5%) at that aswell. It also has the strongest balance sheet and cash balance among its peers.

**Cash Position:**

BAOS is flush with cash and there is no threat of any share dilutions/offerings. BAOS is sitting on over 51 million in cash. Broken out by 11Million in cash pre IPO, 30Million from IPO proceeds and another 10 million received from EBON.

BAOS is cash flow positive with cash from operations each year in excess of 9M annually, further increasing its cash position.

BAOS will be looking to utilize this cash to grow its business through acquisitions, new infrastructure such as NFT platforms and acquiring talented individuals.

**Public Float:**

Baos has one of the smaller active tradeable floats on the market. The initial offering only issued 6 million shares of BAOS with many of these shares being locked up until August.

The stock is largely unknown with volumes being very scarce. This is causing significant bid/ask spreads upwards of 3-4%. This also means there is very few walls for when this gains momentum.

**China Low Float Recent IPO Trend**

Chinese low float stocks have been getting pumped across the markets lately. Many of which have been recent IPO's due to their share lock up periods further reducing the floats.

Some prime examples include:

$EEIQ running form $3.58 to $35.20 in 2 days

$UTME running from $4 to $107 in 2 days

$WAFU running from $4 to $21 in 2 days.

$BAOS meets all the above criteria, with a small float, small market cap and in a hot sector. NFT/Crypto

**Upcoming Press Releases:**

I am expecting a press release to be issued in the next week or two regarding the demo/roll out of their NFT platform.

BAOS's first press release was issued on March 18th regarding the EBON collaboration and entry into the NFT field. This was the first day the company could release news due to its 40day quiet period after a IPO. EBON stated in early February it was looking to enter the NFT field. I expect the partnership was entered in early to mid February. Meaning a news release on the development of the platform for BAOS should be right around the corner.

NFT press releases have cause stocks to skyrocket, and was the hottest sector in March. With stocks such as TKAT, HOFV, DLPN and WKEY gaining as much as 1000%. These stocks have cooled off but most are still trading at 2.5-5x their pre press release values.

The market has cooled off since March but I do expect a large movement the day the PR comes out due to the thin walls and small public float.

**Summary/Price target**

BAOS is a unknown hidden gem. The cash obtained through IPO and Ebon investment will help it improve/expand its infrastructure and significantly grow the business. BAOS is already experiencing over 10% annual growth and these numbers will explode in 2021 thanks to China's online marketing spending growth of 20% + in 2021 combined with BAOS entering into the NFT market which grew 1785% from 2020. BAOS is sitting on over 51m in cash and there is no risk of share offerings due to its cash flow from operations exceeding 9m a year. BAOS is a market leader when it comes to cost minimization and profit margins, experiencing over 62% margins in 2019. BAOS is unknown to many and is not getting the traction is deserves, the first press release will send this flying thanks to its bid/ask spread and being in the NFT sector. BAOS is undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few profitable marketing small cap companies and is sitting on a boat load of cash.

PT Short Term (May): 10$ after the press release relating to the release of its NFT platform. This would make it the similar market cap as IZEA, while BAOS has substantially more cash and is reporting 11m in net income vs Izea's 10M losses.

PT Long Term 2022: $25

I expect revenues to climb 30% + in 2021 thanks to China market growth and entering new NFT fields combined with purchasing/acquiring new infrastructure and talent. BAOS is still being valued as a marketing company (undervalued) and has not capture any of the NFT/Crypto attention.

EDIT: This post is getting some backlash because this subreddit is anti-chinese plays. I am not advocating to toss 100% of your portfolio on this stock. Allocate a small portion and diversify your holdings. This stock is trading at its IPO price and has limited downside thanks to its cash position. Enter with a small portion and set a stop loss to test the waters. This stock is unknown due to the lack of PR's as it just got out of its quiet period. The upcoming PR about its NFT platform will attract new investors and make this rally. Feel free to sell at a gain once it does so or set a stop loss at your initial investment price and ride it out. Dismissing all Chinese investments is a awful investment strategy.

mmivok,,investing,post,1617852005,"New Position: Atlas Air WorldwideMy portfolio has a lot of technology and stocks that have performed well. As some of these stocks get near their all time highs again, I've been cutting down my exposure to some of them because some of them had grown to a large % of my portfolio (a good problem to have). As a result, I've built up some cash and have been looking for cheaper names of beaten down companies outside of technology. One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. 

\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. 

**Company Profile:**

The company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: 

ACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. 

Charter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. 

**2020 Financial Highlights:**

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith & Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. 

Right now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.","['BLK', 'AMZN']"

mlzyon,,investing,post,1617794893,"Investing: the future winners among car manufacturers and your opinionGreetings! I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

**VW** has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, [Frank Walliser](https://presskit.porsche.de/motorsport/en/mediaguide-2017/topic/gt-programs/porsche-gt-team/info/driver/dr-frank-steffen-walliser-porsche-gt-team-wec-gt-2017.html), at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

* VW is a solid bet but they're probably riding higher on hype right now so I'm waiting to see if the price settles a bit lower before making a move.

* BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, etc. are luxury brands that aren't going anywhere but also aren't likely to be major movers in the transition. Their value is tied more to their brand than market share so I'm not particularly interested in them right now. Probably safe but not super exciting.

* I picked up shares of Ford because they're a major manufacturer and because of their stake in Rivian. Admittedly they're moving a bit slow on EVs compared to others but their share price is still low compared to others so it's a safer bet to see short term gains.

VW got a head start over most of their competition because of ""DieselGate"" scandal - when that all blew up they pulled some future ICE projects and went all-in on EV development, starting back in.  Also, some of the penalties they had to pay for DieselGate went towards developing EV charging stations (which can now help their EV sales.  Oh no, such punishment...)

Their bread and butter EV model, the Rav4-sized ID4, will be manufactured on *3 continents* and sold all over the globe.  They have a partnership with QS, with intentions to produce *solid state batteries in 4-5 years*, which could be a significant jump on the competition. 
 VW has gone all-in on this model because it simply *must* succeed for them.  They're not trying to peel away Tesla buyers, they're trying to get CR-V/Rav4 owners to make the switch to a ""normal"" feeling EV crossover.","['ICE', 'TSLA']"

Thoughts on space tech as an investment?

The Offering was made through a syndicate of underwriters led by BMO Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley Canada Limited and Scotiabank, as joint bookrunners, with Barclays Capital Canada Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Canaccord Genuity Corp., CIBC World Markets Inc., National Bank Financial Inc. and Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., as underwriters. 

With over 60 years of space innovation in Canada and a government injection of over 2 Billion dollars Canada has been making serious space news. Today MDA who is the largest benefactor of that investment finalized its initial public offer at $14 per share.

The timing bodes well for MDA as the company has also been active in creating jobs and opportunities for the growing earth observation market. It was [announced](https://techbomb.ca/aerospace/government-of-canada-launches-international-space-program-to-track-illegal-fishing/) last month that the Government of Canada intends to launch an international space program to track illegal fishing.

mm45l7,,investing,post,1617807980,"Drive Shack, the reopening play you never heard of**General Overview:**

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

**My Holdings**: 150 shares as of right now

**FINAL TLDR:** *The company has a lot of potential for growth. It's worth the effort of looking into them ahead of earnings in early May.*",['IR']

Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

The council’s launch comes as prices of many digital assets have surged, drawing in new mainstream investors and the banks and brokers that serve them. Earlier this year, the total market value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, touched $1 trillion for the first time.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost.

**Total Revenue of approximately $1.8 billion**  
**Net Income of approximately $730 million to $800 million**  
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

I need advice and some serious talk.

I am currently sitting on a portfolio of

\- 45% ETF´s  
\- 40% high dividend stocks and reits and such

rest in individual stocks I picked and liked.

I want more growth as I want to reduce the time I need to get to a certain threshold.

I picked the dividend stocks mainly because of the high yield. the lowest yield I get is 4,5%. highest at 13,4%.

I know that

\- those high yields are probably not lasting forever

\- I miss out on growth of the actual securities

but also , ALL dividend securities are green since I bought them.

the lowest being +1,51% (OMF), the highest being 42,88% (OKE).  
the rest is between 8,7% 27,09% green.

what should I do ? sell at green, take the tax hit (which is about 25% of profits where I live -> germany)  
or keep those titles ?

currently I reinvest every dividend payout I get. but those also take a tax hit. so I am missing out on returns and not even benefitting from the full dividend payout...

I am open for all kinds of tips and suggestions.",['OKE']
mljfdc,,investing,post,1617736729,"S&P 500 Flirts With Record, But 'Overbought' Jitters Keep Lid on GainsThe S&P 500 continued to trade near record highs Tuesday, led by energy and consumer stocks, but some on Wall Street are calling for caution as the latest acceleration pushed stocks into ""overbought"" territory.    

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% after hitting a record high of 4,086.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14%, or 46 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.

""Watch the S&P 500 over the next few days for potential consolidation - that benchmark is now very overbought / extended on the short-term trading charts and is likely to see some profit taking ahead in our opinion,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. Initial support is touted in the 3975-to-4000 zone, the firm added.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

""Although we expect near-term volatility as 1Q earnings start on April 14, reflecting weak loan growth, margin pressure, lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonal factors, we remain positive on the bank group,"" Wedbush said.

Technology stocks, were roughly unchanged, with the fab 5 trading mixed, even as falling U.S. bond yields supported investor sentiment on longer-duration growth stocks.  

The U.S. 10-year slipped below 1.7% quote yields after trading in range of 1.67% to 1.72% in recent days. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was higher.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) struggled to get going after racking up a 6% gain on Monday, as investors digested a bearish note from Roth Capital.

Roth Capital said Tesla is only worth $150 a share and suggested the electric automaker was a ""minor player"" in the U.S. and European markets.","['MSFT', 'NDAQ', 'BK', 'PNC', 'FANG', 'TSLA', 'SPGI', 'STT', 'APA', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'DOW', 'DVN', 'FB', 'GOOGL']"

The money i could get for rent here would probably only break me even on taxes in my state, let alone the other expenses that go into being a land lord. What I've been told here is that you're looking to levarage the money you borrow from the bank and make money on the appreciation of the property. 

What if the neighborhood turns to shit?? What if you buy at the peak moments of the sellers market and the value of the home drops drastically. Isn't that leverage going to be equally as bad to the downside? If i put down $100,000 for a $500,000 home and the value drops to $400,000 by years end...

mkzjy4,gtisvs8,investing,comment,1617672980,"I think you're comparing apples to oranges here in a sense. 

First, Real Estate is not a liquid asset like your stocks.  It's something you put into a (likely) minimum 5-10yr time-frame with regards to financial analysis. 

Secondly, you own the entire thing. This is not shares in a company that you have no control over. Your DD on buying a property should be way higher than DD on a stock. You should know the neighborhood and know the risks and be willing to take them.  You should be fiddling with pro-formas constantly to decide if a property works for you. If it doesn't then don't do it.  Also, people forget while there is an advantage to leverage, YOU can decide how much you leverage. If you want to have a 50% leverage to feel safer and have a better cash-flow, then you can. Nothing stops you from doing that. 

RE is a great hedge against inflation. Your cost for money stays static mostly, while inflation goes up and so do your rents and so does the value of your asset. In the same vein you're taking tax breaks on deflation and other expenses. 

Of course your stocks won't call you at 3am on a weeknight letting you know that the water heater has exploded in the garage :) 

Lastly, all your ""what ifs"" apply equally if not more to any stock. What if there's a global pandemic and my airline holdings can't fly anyone. Would you have predicted no one would be watching movies in theaters for 9-12 months? There is inherent risk in any investment, but with RE you're more likely to have a long-term glacial change than rapid fluctuation.",

Weird thing about property, one of the only times banks will loan big money to average Joe.  Real estate makes more millionaires then any industry.  It’s because people can get leverage easily.  The house is collateral.  It’s rare a property drops to $0 or even 50% quickly.  But like any investment, requires you to do your homework.

Don’t buy a cheap single family home in a questionable town that’s supports the coal industry in bumblefuck nowhere with multiple fracking sites within a couple miles.  Then act surprised the town is becoming vacant or there is pollution in the ground water.

Do buy a duplex in a town undergoing gentrification.  It sounds like a joke, but look for where new Micro Breweries are going up.  It’s the trendy shit that puts your town on the map.  You use to look for new McDonald’s or similar franchise growth in small town.  Today it’s micro brews and ChikFilA.  Bonus points if you’re handy or have a construction background.

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.  


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5c7pfn1qgr61.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02a6df6d2de3a51a0842765b61cde1f361d748e

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",['AMP']

ml5nfg,,investing,post,1617691914,"Playboy - Excitement for you and your wallet (Potential 2-4x) DD on PLBY

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought of NFTs on hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at only fans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style& apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming & lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty & Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style & apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming & Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty & Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast)

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['NKE', 'WMT', 'CHD', 'CVS', 'GPS']"

ml5nfg,gtjulec,investing,comment,1617700769,"Did not know that Playboy was still around.  It appears to be a shadow of its' former self per Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy\_Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Enterprises).    


March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed  - now completely digital.  No more glossy centerfolds.

It also appears that the adults now own & run the business, Hugh Hefner died in 2017 and his daughter who ran the company from 1988 to 2009 are no longer an issue.  It is also apparent that most of the losing enterprises from Heff's day have been dropped.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises’ had merged with Mountain Crest - a SPAC.  


According to Schwab:     
Canaccord Genuity Initiates PLBY Group at Buy Rating With $28 Price Target

Craig-Hallum raises price target to $35 from $25

Roth Capital raises PLBY Group's Price Target to $26 From $18, Keeps Buy Rating

Also up 19% yesterday and 4% After hours.  

If I were to buy into PLBY would have to see what their Asian operations & casino openings slated for the next 3 years are.  And what the former Asian operations financials were before they closed them down.    


As to their brand/product - to be crass the product is a commodity.   Not sure if it has any cache anymore.  As to hawking other brands: "" Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. "".  Every company that can,  works with (pays extortionate rates for) celebrities which is a tried-and true way of doing business.  Also pretty tired method.   If you need a reminder of celebrity abuse and how useless it is: doughy-faced Tom Bosley of Happy Days TV show fame gave a rousing recommendation for a swindlers failed investment scheme. 

*On buying sentiment:*   
PLBY has a former reputation to live down, using celebrities to pitch their brand (at very best neutral rating),  their product is barely distinguishable from other brands,  and ""Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals \[like 50% of the population - women\] – ..... I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women"" - this could be insurmountable.   


Seeing the Penthouse Magazine in its' heyday and what it is now and comparing it to PLBY is kind of the flightplan I see for PLBY.  Went from being misogynistic and vapid to totally vapid.  


***In total - good OP analysis of the positive points but PLBY has some serious perception drawbacks.***  


Think PLBY is a sell for the immediate future not a buy particularly given the runup yesterday and last night.  PLBY is still in their first year of a shakedown cruise  trying to see what works with todays clients.   More distance will have to be put between the past and what they are currently going to do to make money.  Also only time will tell if their new clients gained during the pandemic are sticky or flaky (Jesus that has unintended under/overtones).  The cache of going to a Playboy mansion is dead.  Celebrity endorsement is a big bucket of who cares.  But in 5 years - with a considerable amount of re-branding, some outstanding PR, and dropping of certain lines of business - they could make a go of it.    


But then again, I could be hopelessly out of date.  PLBY could be a total surprise.  For me, it is a pass since it has ""faddish and transitory"" stamped in big letters all over it.  Rather like cigarette stocks; except cigarette stocks pay a dividend.  Maybe PLBY is more of a day trade or swing trade.  Definitely not a buy and hold for me.  


***To the OP: good analysis of the positive side of PLBY.  Think you could very successfully write their promotional material for them.  Look forward to seeing your next DD analysis.  If this post is any indicator you are good at this.***",['BEN']

**NIO** - Known as the ""Tesla of China"" it moves exactly as Tesla does and is looking to trade in the Open Market for China as well as the US, basically a Baby tesla

**FUNKO** - now hear me out, with their recent acquisition of an NFT, i can easily see Funko moving into more of a crypto and long term growth play with a possibility of being bought out by Disney, they have also grown tremendously in the last couple of months

**Coinbase** - IPOing through a directly listing on April 30th, this is kind of an obvious play. They make a SHIT ton of money and are the King broker in Crypto and the most mainstream with their revenue growing from half a million in 2019 to 1.1 Billion in 2020

**RKT** - The biggest mortgage company in the US, expanding into Canada and looking for a fintech category, they are extremely well positioned to start acquiring other companies and start dipping their toes into other sector of the financial market (car loans, Zillow/Redfin Competitors, etc)

**Roblox** - This is strictly here because they are the amazon of gaming. People are able to make money off of Roblox and that makes it a great growth company, really any company that you can make money off of is suitable for huge growth not to mention their insane money spending crowd of kids

**Disney** - hear me out. Expansion coming for disneyland to build two more parks. Their Disney+ series is only going to get better with more marvel and star wars original content and anyone that is a parent knows how good Disney+ is. Also, once everything opens up they will be making money off theaters + their new movie releases on Disney+ to watch from home. I think they have plenty of growth left.

**Apple** - But apple i already the most valuable company how can they possible be considered a *growth* company at these high valuations. Two words for you ""apple car"" and ""Apple glasses""

**Tesla** - for obvious reasons, self driving, insurance for that self driving, more cars, EV charging expansion, all that good stuff

**RIOT** - literally the only reason this is up here is if you think Bitcoin is going to go higher then so is RIOT. in one year it went from $0.70 to highs of $75.....yup, its trading right now at under $50 i think and can easily hit $100+ as long as BTC keeps moving upwards

mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",['TSLA']

I'm analysing Wizzair using data from quickfs... but some of the numbers don't match the company income statement! An example is the total operating expenses being 108m EUR instead of >1600m EUR.... Is this a common problem?

What is the best way to get high quality, reliable fundamentals data for US, UK and EU companies? Paid services are okay. Or do I just have to dig through company reports myself?

Would appreciate any help. I'm far from an accountant by training and very confused!",
mkga30,gth6xb2,investing,comment,1617645022,"Using a throwaway account, mainly because I'm embarrassed at how little I know, and also because some personal details.

I have a large sum to invest (partly inheritance) ie around 0.5m . I have some experience of investing, but not a lot, and the recent increase in my portfolio means there's now a lot more to lose.

I don't really need the money as income (have other sources), so what I want to do is invest it for long term (30 years or so) and may not touch it before I die, and pass it on. 

I would like to grow it as much as possible, and of course not lose it.

So my thinking is index funds. I have to accept that I am not educated enough in finance, and probably not smart enough to get sufficiently educated, to be able to do successful stock picking, much as I would like to. I also don't trust a third party to manage the money fairly or well (not saying my lack of trust is justified, just that I have it).

So then the question is - which index funds?

Although people often suggest that index investing is a simple activity, I would have thought it matters greatly which index you pick.

So my questions are:

- Should I pick an S&P 500 index, even though the P/E ratio looks very much on the high side?

- Should I pick something like the British FTSE 100, which is thought to be undervalued at the moment? And then maybe come back to S&P 500 later?

- Should I choose an emerging markets ETF?

- Or stay in cash until S&P 500 cools down a bit?


I would certainly want to get more than inflation, and more than bonds would give me. I'm happy to sit through ups and downs, I just feel like the decision I make at this point is going to have long-reaching ramifications on my final portfolio.

Many thanks for any help!","['UPS', 'SPGI']"

It seems that Biden doesn't support full-fledged federal legalization. He seems more interested in federal decriminalization and let the states decide what to do for now. If that is the case, these vertically integrated multistate operators (MSOs) will have get a bigger and bigger market share as time goes on. The sooner federal legalization happens, the sooner they can lose market share to opposition (Canadian companies, big tobacco, etc). But because weed is federally illegal, they can't be listed on the NYSE. Being an OTC stock means less hedge funds and big whales invested in these highly profitable companies. Federal legalization can lead the way for them to up-list. Hopefully seeing a boost. 

So I'm bullish because I don't think we'll see federal legalization in the next year, maybe two. It'll let these companies expand. 

As for Curaleaf, they recently saw their bump because of NY legalizing weed. As well as Green Thumb, Cresco, and many other northeast operators.

mjwo8q,,investing,post,1617544552,"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policiesThe waste industry is more than just hard-working gentlemen and women collecting trash from your home or business. It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

There isn’t a lot to do in the southern states,and middle america. This results in most people pouring money into their cars as one of their main hobbies. My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth. They are rapidly taking over the aftermarket part market through acquisitions. Including expanding into the aftermarket EV car market.

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['NOV', 'GOOGL']"

Option prices are complex non-linear functions of the SP500 index. 
The risk neutral volatility is mostly expected volatility on SP500, which is partly based on realized volatility and investors sentiment about future risks on SP500.

mq1nzm,,StockMarket,post,1618318526,"Breast Cancer Advancement x Accustem Sciences Limited in the U.S.Accustem Sciences Limited (""Accustem""), intends to file a listing application with the Nasdaq Stock Market

Why this matters ...

Accustem Sciences is responsible for StemPrintER -  a multi-gene prognostic assay intended to predict the risk of recurrence of R+/HER2- breast cancer, and Spare, a derivative of StemPrintER, combines StemPrintER with two clinical markers. This gives a more refined risk model.

This all aids in the prediction of the risk of recurrence of breast cancer, based on the detection of 20 stem cell markers. The assay has been evaluated in an initial retrospective validation study using a consecutive cohort of approximately 2,400 patients with breast cancer. 

Subsequently, StemPrintER has been further validated in an independent retrospective cohort of more than 800 ER+/HER2- postmenopausal patients from the TransATAC trial.

A poster presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Conference in May 2020, demonstrated the superiority of StemPrintER stem cell based genomic prognostic tool versus the market leader, Oncotype DX, in predicting recurrence in ER+/HER2- postmenopausal breast cancer patients.  

Endocrine receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers make up most breast cancer cases, however display significant variability in clinical behaviour, this makes prognosis and therapy response challenging. Although the overall prognosis of patients is good, a significant proportion of these women will experience distant recurrence in the first 10 years post-surgery.

For patients who also have a negative HER2 status (HER2-) and risk of recurrence, the standard of care is endocrine therapy, with the addition of chemotherapy in patients. However, these parameters are often insufficient to predict risk of recurrence in ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients, and consequently, these patients are either over- or under-treated.

Accustem anticipates this prognostic test to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation to identify those patients at increased risk for early and/or late metastasis

First the Cubs, then the World Cup -- fuboTV is doing everything it can to position itself for long-term growth

By [**Luke Lango**](https://investorplace.com/author/lukelango/)**, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst** Apr 12, 2021, 1:55 pm EDT

Live TV streaming platform **fuboTV** (NYSE:[**FUBO**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/fubo-stock-quote/)) has been one of the market’s most polarizing battleground stocks over the past few months. On one side, you have FUBO stock bulls, who believe fuboTV is building this next-gen interactive betting and streaming platform for live sports.

📷Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com

On the other side, you have the FUBO stock short-sellers, who believe that fuboTV is just another commoditized streaming platform that is burning money on acquiring content with no real competitive advantage.

Both arguments have some merit.

But, over the past week, the scales have tilted in favor of the bull thesis, as fuboTV has taken some major steps to execute strongly on turning into a differentiated streaming platform with a compelling value prop.

I believe fuboTV will continue to execute strongly over the next few months. As the company does, the bear thesis will drown out, and the bull thesis will come to life. fuboTV’s subscriber, revenue, and profit numbers will soar. So will FUBO stock.

The investment implication?

It’s time to buy — and hold — fuboTV stock for the long haul.

Here’s a deeper look.

FUBO Stock: The Long-Term Bull Thesis

The long-term bull thesis on FUBO stock is pretty simple, and it boils down to this: fuboTV is in the first inning of building a next-generation streaming platform where sports fans can interactively bet on micro-events in sporting games on a real-time basis.

Imagine this.

Fast forward to 2025. You and you friend are sitting on your couch, watching the Golden State Warriors basketball game through fuboTV on your smart TV. Stephen Curry gets fouled and goes to the free throw line. You and your friend take out your phones and open up the fuboTV app. You each place a $5 bet on the app that Curry will make the free throw. He does. You both win $5. And you two go back to watching the game until the next “bettable” moment, at which point you pull out the fuboTV app again and place a micro-bet.

That’s the future.

It may not be fuboTV that builds that future. But someone will build that future. And the bull thesis on FUBO stock is that fuboTV will be the company that does build that future, because they are the first-mover in this space.

But… a first-mover advantage is only good if the company executes on the opportunity.

And that’s exactly what fuboTV management is starting to do: Execute on this huge opportunity of building an interactive sports-betting-and-streaming platform.

[**LUKE LANGO: “I’M STANDING OUTSIDE THE HQ OF MY #1 TECH STOCK TO BUY NOW”**](https://orders.investorplace.com/?cid=MKT516215&eid=MKT523583&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start)

It Starts With Content

The first step in building an all-in-one interactive sports betting-and-streaming platform is acquiring the rights to all sorts of sports content, preferably exclusive rights to develop a content moat. The second step is creating a digital sportsbook that integrates with that sports content.

FuboTV is presently doing both — and that’s great news for FUBO stock.

Over the past two weeks, fuboTV has signed a deal with Marquee Sports Network to bring non-national Chicago Cubs baseball games to its streaming platform, and acquired the exclusive streaming rights to the Qatar World Cup 2022 qualifying matches. These two deals represent a strong continuation of fuboTV’s ability to build out an exclusive content moat with unique sporting events, including local sports and hard-to-watch international sports.

Long-term, we suspect that fuboTV will be able to leverage its sports-first focus and scale to be able to win content partnerships with most local sports networks — like Spectrum Sportsnet for Los Angeles Lakers games — as well as most international sports organizations. Some, if not all, of these content partnerships will be exclusive, meaning that at scale, we see fuboTV as being the exclusive streaming home for everything-you-can watch sports.

This will, of course, make fuboTV a compelling streaming platform option for sports fans.

It Continues With the Betting

At the same time, fuboTV is aggressively acquiring the assets and rights necessary to launch a full-fledged digital sportsbook in 2021.

The company recently acquired sports betting and interactive gaming company, Vigtory. FuboTV expects to leverage the underlying betting technology at Vigtory to create a seamless betting experience for the fubo Sportsbook.

The company has also secured market access agreements for the fubo Sportsbook in Iowa, Indiana, and New Jersey, and both the NBA and MLB have made fuboTV an “authorized gaming operator” of their leagues.

In other words, fuboTV is doing everything it needs to be doing today to successfully launch an integrated digital sportsbooks in 2021, and subsequently scale that sportsbook in 2022-plus.

Again, this is great news for FUBO stock.

Huge Upside Potential for fuboTV Stock

If fuboTV successfully executes on its vision, the potential upside in FUBO stock is enormous.

Here are the numbers.

There are tens of millions of diehard sports fan in America. Against that backdrop, if fuboTV does become an integrated sports-betting-and-streaming platform with exclusive content rights, it will easily attract 10 million paid subscribers by 2030. Average revenue per subscriber per month should exceed $70, driven by a mix of subscription fees, ad revenues and betting commissions. That implies north of $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running toward 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030. Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

FuboTV has an uphill battle ahead of it. Building a dominant sports-betting-and-streaming platform will be hard. But if the company pulls it off — and I suspect they can, given recent developments — the potential upside in FUBO stock is enormous.

This is a good name to own as a speculative long-term investment.

But it’s not the best speculative long-term investment opportunity in the market today.

The price is reaching a critical point where buyers have to show their interest in order to keep the daily trend an active uptrend.

mpn2qm,,StockMarket,post,1618260678,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 12, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 12, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly even on Monday, with the market taking a breather after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recorded several fresh highs last week. Looking ahead, market participants will focus on the upcoming Quarter 1 earnings report slated to be released in the next weeks. Big banks are kicking off the earnings season starting Wednesday premarket. 

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

Year-to-date, the cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening sectors have broadly outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher last year. The first quarter of 2021 was defined by the rotation out of high-flying tech stocks and into companies poised to directly benefit from the reopening of the economy. However, now that Quarter 2 started, we are seeing the rotation back into growth and tech stocks, with mega-cap companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) driving the market to record levels. In our view, while we expect tech stocks to continue performing well, it is highly unlikely they replicate the outsized performance from 2020 and continue to look for opportunities in companies that were most affected by COVID and that are poised to benefit from the reopening of the economy. Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note “The initial reopening of the economy will trigger a huge rebound in margins across sectors which have been hit hardest by the COVID crisis. The unprecedented surge in households' cash balances over the past year – mostly due to the enforced drop in spending on services, augmented by stimulus payments – represents a potential wave of demand, while supply is constrained by business failures.”

mplgzs,,StockMarket,post,1618256084,"In-depth DD on Bio Stock Nearing Approval of Breakthrough Drug to Treat Depression: Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM)**Company Overview:**

Axesome Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019 around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product, an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective, they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or are nearing submission.

Their executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies. Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2 with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO. United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase 3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is safe.

NDA Preparation: The company gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and marketing.

NDA Submission: After submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come, first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of submission.

COVID-19 slowed the review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites, among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05: An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough syrup).

While ketamine and psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase 2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA, they believe their application will be accepted and approved in relatively short order.

AXS-05 is also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S. out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2 Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07 contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor, and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA submission.

AXS-09: An oral medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s development in the past 2 years after the success of their other products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12: An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it. They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health, AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up, they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission. MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs. They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their approval.

**Finances:**

https://preview.redd.it/t24y6srrnss61.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00d87be098151fff6c300d330173441a8a2e5b2

As you can see above, their operating costs have increased significantly over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due to increased stock compensation for employees.  

Their operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall, they state their current resources should fund their anticipated operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the near future.

The company has zero revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716) from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression, including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S. It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14% since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a 5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may gain revenue from international commercialization and their other products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name) for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that. It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20, they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

https://preview.redd.it/9uf1a4v1oss61.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=493227867e620fe9307eaf5f6024e35c8f090268

The stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of 2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase. The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December 2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12% of total volume.

https://preview.redd.it/nhif31d4oss61.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d1945faf7ad23f444d3d0e4fc68b2487da830a

AXSM has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64% respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000 worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80. Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/) shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

https://preview.redd.it/1ivdhx88oss61.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=3190a94e9830d86385f6f502b5a8efd813650af5

https://preview.redd.it/14zbhap9oss61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=013d6be0edbe295ac52d549cd193f2515ca8f93c

There has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1) Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020 (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05 and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing. I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers) of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy Designation.

https://preview.redd.it/p8qolbzeoss61.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad6fc771921c84be4d78fab3130183be08a1e3e1

Short-term, it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend. Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf), drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the AXS-07 NDA.

I don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28, indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However, the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S. market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in the year.

mpmzaz,,StockMarket,post,1618260404,"AMC- Any Idea what this means for Friday?Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) saw some unusual options activity on Monday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $8.97.

Sentiment: BULLISH
Option Type: SWEEP
Trade Type: PUT
Expiration Date: 2021-04-16
Strike Price: $11.00
Volume: 4649
Open Interest: 13431
Three Ways Options Activity Is â??Unusual'

Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).

The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.

""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.

Bullish And Bearish Sentiments

Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.

These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.

Trading Options With These Strategies

Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

mpgd08,,StockMarket,post,1618241682,"Zoom Competitor Pexip - Trading Update Q1 - Still a Buy - Target price: $20 (+93% to current PPS)The company's stock price had a strong Jan & Feb performance (+62%). Last week they released a [trading update](https://news.cision.com/pexip-as/r/pexip-continues-strong-growth-with-54--increase-in-annual-recurring-revenue,c3321398), with a few interesting highlights:

* ARR increased to $87.2 million in Q1-21, growing 54% YoY
* Of that 54% YoY growth, 50 percentage points are from new customers and 4 come from existing customers
* After annual churn of 9%, the company showed a net revenue retention rate of 104% with existing customers over the last twelve months
* Net new ARR in Q1-21 was $5.4 million vs $9.5 million in Q1-20

**ARR Growth**

There has been a significant decrease in ARR growth from 73% in Q4-20 to 54% in Q1-21. This is partially explained by Q1-21 being the first quarter in which YoY growth includes the Covid-19 related spike in ARR in Q1-20. Lets take a closer look at the net new ARR (NNARR) development over time. Shown below, we can observe that in Q1-20, NNARR spiked from $4.3 million in the previous quarter to $9.5 million, the highest in the company’s history. Over the course of Q2 and Q3, NNARR decreased incrementally to $7 million before it jumped back to $9.1 million in Q4. One could reasonably argue that the fluctuation to some degree mirrors global lock-down situations. On the other hand, Q4 tends to be a strong quarter in the year. Nevertheless, the drop of NNARR to $5.3 million in Q1-21 is notable and Q2-21 will provide valuable insights into how much of the new demand for video conferencing solutions will remain as lock-downs are increasingly lifted.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2uyo5ge3hrs61.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=f274c3af66fa6950c2298c5304c248320d0d1961

**Product & Partnerships**

In December 2020, the company launched its Private Cloud offering, which is tailored to address the specific needs of large public sector and enterprise customers. Private Cloud is a new deployment option for Pexip’s video conferencing platform to allow customer to maintain full control over their data while being scalable within large environments and (almost) hardware agnostic across conference rooms.

Additionally, Pexip Health was launched in February, specifically designed for healthcare practitioners who want to provide video visit solutions to their patients.

Pexip also announced the launch of a native integration with Epic, the world’s largest electronic health record system which is currently used by more than 250 million patients worldwide. From this partnership, the company already saw several new contract wins.

**Key new contracts wins in Q1-21 include**

* A $0.8m ARR contract with New South Wales Health in Australia
* A $0.3m ARR contract with the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; another example of a contract win through Pexip’s interoperability solution with MS Teams
* Honeywell, USA, also including a MS Teams interoperability solution

**Public trading**

Since its high around $13.8 in late February, the company’s PPS declined by 17% until the middle of this week before the trading update. The drop was in line with the broader cloud software market, but in the two days after the announcement, the PPS fell another 11% closing the week at $10.3. Due to its fantastic January and (most of) February, Pexip still outperformed the Cloud Software Index (WCLD) by 39% since the beginning of the year. After the drop at the end of this week, Pexip is trading at an attractive multiple of 9.4x NTM revenues, assuming a conservative 40% NTM revenue growth rate.

**Interoperability**

One of Pexip’s USPs is interoperability, which describes the ability to join cloud meetings of different software providers using hardware from different third-party vendors. Imagine you walk into any meeting room equipped with Cisco or Poly video conferencing systems and want to join the Microsoft Teams meeting or Google Hangouts call. The capability to do that is called interoperability. As of March 2021, Pexip is still [one out of only four certified vendors to offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/cloud-video-interop) an interoperability solution with Microsoft Teams and [the only vendor ](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7673980?hl=en)to offer a Google Meet interoperability solution, making Pexip’s solution especially attractive for customers with a large number of conference rooms equipped with hardware solutions from different vendors; which is most large enterprises.

**Takeaways**

Pexip focuses on government and large enterprise customers, which typically have longer sales cycles. This means we should expect see a prolonged period of high growth from new customer throughout 2021 as large organizations switch to video conferencing solutions with a strong security and interoperability offering.

As shown in the company’s very directional product innovation and partnership building, Pexip is strengthening its competitive advantage in a niche part of the market. Given that video conferencing is already being commoditized, this is the smart thing to do in order to create differentiation and defensibility.

The decrease in net new business generated in Q1-21 is concerning but not alarming. Nevertheless, low net new ARR this quarter cautions to set a more conservative growth outlook for the company. For that reason I decrease my price target to $20. For Q2-21, increased churn with smaller customers is likely. Gross new ARR with enterprise customers will be the most important metric to watch.","['MMM', 'MSFT', 'MS', 'GOOGL']"

April 9, 2021 This story originally appeared on [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/coinbase-nasdaq-coin-ipo-3-things-for-investors-to-know/?utm_source=entrepreneurcom&amp;utm_medium=entrepreneurcom). Given the astounding growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin over the past year, it’s no wonder that the upcoming Coinbase ([NASDAQ:COIN](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/COIN/)) IPO is one of the most anticipated market events of 2021. As the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase generates massive revenue from transaction fees on its platform and has already given investors insight into its huge earnings potential. It might just be a company that lives up to the hype surrounding its market debut. 

While there is certainly an element of unpredictability with this business thanks to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, that likely won’t deter investors from grabbing shares of the company when it goes public via a direct listing on **April 14th as COIN**. Coinbase is certainly an intriguing player in the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry, which is why we’ve put together a list of 3 things for investors to know about the company ahead of its big debut.  


[**The First U.S. Cryptocurrency Exchange to be Publicly Listed**](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/369033)  


Cryptocurrency has come a long way in a very short time. These digital assets are kept on a shared ledger known as a blockchain and have increased in popularity largely due to the meteoric rise in the price of [Bitcoin](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/this-is-why-bitcoin-will-hit-59000-in-2021/). With more and more businesses and financial institutions getting on board the cryptocurrency train, it’s easy to see the potential in a company like Coinbase. It offers users a simple and safe way to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies on its platform. Coinbase has also developed an advanced crypto trading platform called Coinbase Pro that cryptocurrency enthusiasts love.  


The company generates revenue by charging transaction fees every time its users buy or sell a cryptocurrency on its platform. It also makes money from things like margin fees, custodial services, and a rewards credit card program. ***The company’s platform enables approximately 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions, and 115,000 ecosystem partners to participate in the crypto economy.*** Since ***this is the first major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange to be publicly listed, i***t could be a major step towards the widespread adoption of digital currency and will go a long way towards legitimizing the industry. This is one of the big reasons why the company’s debut is attracting so much attention.

**Eye-Catching Earnings**

Most high-growth companies that make their market debuts are a long way from reaching profitability. This is another big reason why Coinbase stands out. The company has already delivered some eye-catching earnings that could send the stock price soaring on April 14th. Coinbase had a very strong 2020, during which it generated $1.1 billion in revenue and $322 million in net income. Those were solid numbers for a company that has only been around since 2012, but what’s even more impressive is that the company has already eclipsed those figures in the first quarter of 2021.

Coinbase recently provided investors with its estimated Q1 earnings numbers that likely boosted the company’s valuation by billions. ***The company reported $1.8 billion in Q1 revenue, which topped its revenue for the entirety of 2020. Coinbase also saw $355 billion in trading volume in Q1, which surpassed the entire trading volume of last year. Total assets on Coinbase’s platform increased from $90 billion to $223 billion, which represents 11.3% of the crypto-asset market share. It’s also worth noting that the $223 billion in assets includes $122 billion from institutions, confirming that Coinbase is becoming a trusted name among sophisticated investors.***","['AMP', 'NDAQ']"

I have read a number of ESG reports and pretty much all companies suck in my experience. 

It's also a philosophical question, since there is no such thing as an objective positive.

Take $IPGP for example. They produce core components of lasers. Lasers have an incredible and ever increasing amount of applications and they try to make them cheaper and cheaper, so that looks pretty good, right? At the same time, their ESG scores aren't that great (not sure about their competitors). It might be that a sufficiently powerful laser in the future might allow a form of cheap fusion leading to a revolution in the energy field, which would make laser technology even more valuable and would allow us to solve essentially all world problems. I think the potential payoff is so great that it was worth an investment and potentially some low ESG scores. I think they are trying, though. Does this mean it *is* positive? No idea, but the alternative is that we stop developing new technology and all die when the Sun grows (if not much sooner).

$IPGP depends on rare Earth materials and mining typically is bad for the environment, although it could theoretically be done in a way that would not be bad for the environment. The ESG score of $IPGP is 5. 

Is science a good thing? The modern world has brought about a lot of misery too, but it also solved many awful diseases.

The way i use the rsi is as follows: look for a bullish divergence at an import support level.

mp2xy9,,StockMarket,post,1618187021,"$THCB DD and Float Break DownA few days was the Wedbush electric Vehicle Conference: [https://youtu.be/2xCPpMiTtz0](https://youtu.be/2xCPpMiTtz0)

$THCB is merging with Microvast. Currently needs to pass extension vote and then merger vote to successfully complete merger. However After watching the video below you will be confident in the fact they will complete merger.  

(More detailed DD can be found here :[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ls6r6v/thcb\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ls6r6v/thcb_dd/))

Extremely bullish. Two key take aways: Solid State was mentioned & passenger vehicle use of batteries.  I encourage everyone to spend 30 mins and watch this webinar. 

Another Interesting Take away: Volkswagon & Daimler were name dropped 

One of the most telling quotes ""We currently supply to SAIC, the largest OEM in China and in this project we competed with CATL, the largest cell maker in the world -we won by performance and by price""  -  Dr Wenjuan Mattis -Microvast CTO

I am speculating  you will find out more about these marquee customers, solid state, passenger vehicles ect. in the coming weeks and months.

&#x200B;

THCB has a [low float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=THCB):  **35.48M** million float. Institutions and insiders own about **\~39.93% of the float.** The rest is owned by the public. I suppose that leaves about 21.61 million shares in the public float that are trade-able.  Currently **7.27% of the float is being shorted.**

It also has experienced relatively low volume recently.  Retail hasn't had much interest in it outside of the segment of traders that utilize SPACs as an investment vehicle and many larger institutions are not currently investing in SPACs. There also hasn't been much media attention given to it yet which leaves a wider audience unaware of this stock. This presents a good opportunity as the prices have largely stabilized at this levels with low volume.

*Things to be aware of:* [Extension Vote April 28th,](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-017603/def14a0321_tuscanholdings.htm) *65% of shareholders as of 3/17/21 must vote for extension. Previous extension vote passed and this one is expected to pass as well*.\* Extension votes does not mean deal is at risk. $THCB has had to utilize extensions because they found their target near the end of their 2 years. These extensions have been a known and pivotal part of the merger process.  They are currently in day 69 of the post DA phase and should be merging around May if $THCB follows the typical timeline of SPAC mergers.

\*If the  [extension vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/mmxf0i/thcb_interesting_find_in_the_extension_vote/) were to be in danger THCB leading up to the vote companies directors or executive officers can purchase shares. These shares would be eligible to vote on the extension.

*Post Merger there will be a 300 million float* . The deal will provide Microvast with nearly $822 million in gross cash proceeds to fund growth initiatives. The amount includes about $282 million in cash held by THCB in trust and an additional $540 million in [**PIPE**](https://marketrealist.com/p/what-is-pipe-in-a-spac/) (private investment in public equity) at $10 per share. Investors in the PIPE include Oshkosh, BlackRock, Koch Strategic Platforms, and InterPrivate. Existing Microvast shareholders are set to own about 70 percent of the combined company when the deal closes. The combined company’s pro forma implied equity value is $3 billion.

**Up coming events**: $THCB Microvast's Shane Smith,Chief operating Officer will be speaking at TennSMART forum (4/14/21) on Electric Vehicle Transportation in Tennessee along side Victoria Hirshber, Director of Business Development, of the Tennessee Department of Economic & Community Development.

mp5u2k,,StockMarket,post,1618197674,"Resubmitting my NEE DD that I did for a discord. Hopefully the formatting is better this time. Before continuing I feel like I should make clear that I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don’t have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I’ll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I’m expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I’m also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy. 

NextEra Energy Inc (ticker symbol NYSE: NEE) is the world largest utility company and is composed of three subsidies, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Gulf Energies, and NextEra Energy Resources LLC, which, combined with its affiliated entities, is the worlds largest green energy supplier/generator or solar and wind energy, well earning it the title of Supermajor. Traditionally the title of Supermajor is reserved for the largest players in the oil and gas industries since those companies control the energy that powers modern civilization, oil. However due the recent drop in cost to build and maintain renewable energy generation along with a larger than anticipated federal backing, renewables have lead to a new wave of energy Supermajors rolling in, and NextEra is leading the charge. Not just in the US, but globally as well. In this DD I am going to attempt to go over some basic financial information as well as some upcoming and past events that I see as growth opportunities and how those all pertain to NEE’s potential to be a long term dividend growth company that I feel deserves a spot in any investors portfolio if their time horizon is 30 years plus like mine is with my Roth IRA. (I am currently 23, so I can’t touch my tax free earnings for another 36 years, but that’s okay because I’m that time I’m expecting an avalanche of snowballs to occur if I’m successful in picking my portfolio.)

NEE pays a dividend traditionally in the months of March, June, September, and December. NEE stock is operating with a current share price of $77.94 and a current dividend FY 2021 dividend payment of $1.55 with a yield of 1.98%, down from their 4 year average of 2.78% which is itself down from the Utility Sector average of 3.24% suggesting it still has room to grow its dividend as NEE continues to lead the world in green energy generation. This current yield represents an \~10.71% increase from last fiscal years dividend of $1.40. Looking into FY2022 it is expected that the payout will again increase, this time to $1.71 representing another \~10.71% increase YoY.  And while NEE themselves have only offered guidance through 2022, Morningstar Analysts have gone a bit further, and predict NEE to raise its dividend by >10% each year through 2024. While this may seem like a bullish prediction it is important to know that NEE has been increasing its dividend for the last 27 years and has raised its dividend an average of 9.6% each year since 2005 and in the last 5 years alone, it has grown its dividend by over 12.5%. Finally, NEE only has a dividend payout ratio of 61.31%, which explains its dividend safety score of 99 and why analysis expect this dividend to continue to grow. Thanks in part to its share price appreciation but mostly it’s growing dividend, NEE has been able to provide a total return to shareholders of 700% over the last 10 years while the S&P 500 only returned 267% or less than half that of NEE.

Moving away from the dividend financials and looking more broadly at the companies overall holdings one ratio that sticks out to me is the Debt/Equity ratio of 1.32 which suggests that they are financing some of their expansion/growth and expenses by taking on debt. While this might seem like a bad thing, companies, especially utility companies focusing on green and renewable energy, are expected to leverage their debt and take on more debt to expand during this early developmental stage for the industry as a whole. Additionally when compared to its US competitors of Duke Energy ($DUK) and Southern Company ($SO), then NEE actually has a lower D/E ratio since both of them have a ratio of 1.34 and 1.84 respectively. The next question that might naturally come to mind then is “Well if they have a lower D/E ratio does that mean they are growing slower than the other two companies mentioned?” While that is a great concern to have but one that is ultimately not needed. The reason for this is because NextEra has been investing into green and renewable energy for so long and so aggressively that its is now able to funnel some of the profits it is starting to see from those initial investments into growing itself and expanding, thus reducing its need to grab more debt. 

A perfect example of this occurred in 2018 when NextEra Energy Resources finalized a massive deal that saw them acquire 11 new and under construction solar and wind farms that are now starting to become profitable as they were essentially being used to pay for them selves during the first three years NEE owned them per the terms of the contract (it was a 3 year payment period). Luckily time tends to move forward rather predictably and now, 3 years later in 2021 NEE is able to start using the profits from the approximately 1,388 MW (1MW is enough to power 400-900 average American homes for a year) generated from those facilities to finance itself rather than pay for the purchase of those facilities. One such project they are financing is their ‘30-by-30’ plan, where they intend to install at least 30 million active and generating solar panels in Florida alone by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that they believe they can accomplish and when you realize that there are only just over 2 millions solar panels actively in use across all of America, anyone can see the potential upside that being the one to supply all those panels and the energy they generate might bring.  This is an approximate 15X the current number of solar panels in the country, only they expect them to be all in a single state. It’s worth noting that this isn’t even NEE’s only future oriented project, but rather just one that highlights the growth potential NEE has in the long run.  

Another important metric to consider when looking at a company from a dividend growth perspective, is its cash flow. As one might expect from a dividend aristocrat, NEE is cash flow positive and has been increasing its cash flow YoY consistently (while paying down large amounts of debt left and right such as in 2020 when they paid off all their short term debt for that year as well as an additional $5 billion in long term debt) with the exception of 2018 which as previously discussed was a year of large growth and spending, and 2020 which was a global pandemic and even then, NEE was more even with 2019’s cash flow and didn’t really lose any; NEE was cash flow positive for both 2020 and 2018 despite the increased spending or macroeconomic hardships and raised its dividend during each as well. Another thing to note is that it has relatively maintained its operating income proportionally over the years ($4-$5 billion/year) even as its new projects come online and are intergraded into its network. This shows it’s still growing and maintaining it’s expected level of operations at its older sites. 

Another import financial element involved in long term dividend growth investing is a companies Price/Book ratio value. In this case NEE has a P/B ratio of 4.18, significantly higher than the Utility Sectors average of 2.66 currently. I believe there is an explanation for this however, and it has to do with NEE’s heavy investments (spending a lot of money years ago before it was even close to profitable) into renewables and green energy over the years that has caused this higher number. When you compare NEE to Ørsted ($DNNGY), which has a P/B ratio of 4.56 and has been investing into green and renewable energy almost as aggressively and as long as NEE and you can see how the larger renewable utility sector that is focused on growth is trading at a higher P/B ratio than the rest of the Utility Sector in general. 

The final financial metric I am interested in when looking at a dividend growth stock is its P/E ratio, and this is where NEE’s main critique comes into play. NEE’s current P/E ratio is 53, a  bit higher than the industry average of 28 (as of 2019, and 23 as of 2020 when looking at only electric companies) and the average range of 15-25 that its closest US competitors currently occupy. Personally I believe two things can happen because of this higher than average P/E ratio. 

1) Investors eventually believe the stock price is over valued and as a result I believe that the price/share will fall as investors sell off to make a profit before it corrects to a lower P/E. 

\- If this is something you believe would happen but still want to invest for the long term growth than I believe a decent strategy might be to consider dollar cost averaging in until the price starts to trade sideway indicating it’s more or less bottomed out, and when it reaches that point you can buy a majority of your shares than. 

2) Investors don’t believe the stock price is overvalued long enough for NEE to increase its earnings, thus lowering the P/E ratio by making more money as more and more projects are completed and acquisitions start to provide income instead of being used to purely pay for themselves. 

\- Now if this happens to be what you believe to be true then I believe the best course of action would be to open a majority of your position in NEE now and then dollar cost average in as time goes on and taking advantage of any single red days or the market as a whole is down. 

Now personally I believe that a combination of both options will occur where the share price will fall \~14.28% from today’s price to the analysis’ low price target of $66 over the course of a year or so. At the same time however I also expect NEE to increase their earnings by a combination of increasing generation capacity and service area, as well as saving large amounts of money on the costs of harvesting, storing, and transporting solar and wind power which have dropped 70% since 2010 and are continuing to do so. I then expect the price to bounce back if it fell to much, or trade about flat if it corrected just right, around a P/E ratio more in line with its industry, around 15-25. As a result I’m personally planning to buy shares next time it’s time to add to my Utilities Sector in my Roth IRA and continue buying more shares as time goes on. 

The next segment of NextEra that I want to dive into are its upcoming projects, and while I’ve eluded to a few previously in this write up such as their ‘30-by-30’ plan, which actually includes another upcoming community solar project within it called SolarTogether that, when completed, will be the worlds largest solar network of its type. NEE also merged two of its main subsidiaries, Florida Power and Light with Gulf Energy at the start of 2021. 

NextEra Energies ‘30-by-30’ plan is a current project and ongoing investment that is already underway which will generate an additional estimated 10,000 MW/year to their network. Furthermore, within the ‘30-by-30’ plan is a project named SolarTogether, which is estimated to generate 15% of the ‘30-by-30” plans total output or 1,500 MW/year, is a solar community project that, when completed, will be the worlds largest community solar project. SolarTogether will allow customers to offset up to 100% of their electricity use with solar. SolarTogether also allows individuals to sign up to use excess solar energy produced by neighbors when an individual doesn’t have any solar panels on their roof and doesn’t want to pay to install them. This offers a cheaper and greener form of energy that would have been either wasted if the battery for that area was full already or just put into that battery for storage, allowing NEE to make more money off of of what is essentially excess power since it’s only the energy not needed by the original home that collected it. 

The final bit of acquisition/merger news that I feel is pertinent and deserves to be discussed is the merger of NEE’s subsidiaries FPL and Gulf Energy. Under the now single entity, NEE, will officially begin shifting its entire company to a entirely green energy focus. In 2021 it is closing its final coal powered plant and no longer using any coal generated energy while simultaneously pledging to no longer build any combined cycle gas plants and cancelling any ongoing construction on projects not yet completed. This is to keep in line with their company pledge to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2029 compared to NEE’s emissions in 2005. In addition, another aspect of NEE’s green energy pledge is to use the merged companies to work on and complete a planned 409 MW solar energy battery. When completed, it will be the world largest solar energy battery but it will still only be a part of NEE’s plan to increase total storage capacity by 1,200 MW by 2029 dramatically increasing their storage capabilities. 

NEE is a utility sector green and renewable energy focused energy provider that currently trades at $77.94, has an analysis target price range of $66 - $101, and an average price target of $87.50. Personally I see NEE’s share price falling no more than \~15% (hitting the analysis low PT of $66) as it’s revenue continues to rise resulting in a reduction to its current P/E ratio sometime this year. Once that happens I expect the price to bounce and return to its expected rate of return of close to 8-9% plus its dividend growth rate averaging 9-12% which could carry the stock back to the APT of $87.50 with occasional spikes and run ups close to $100 this year, and finally passing $100 in 2022.  As such I  planning on buying a few shares when I’m next able to invest and will continue to dollar cost average in regardless of the price as I view this as a truest safe long term 20+ year play that I can sit on and just watch snowball until I’m ready to retire in like 30 years. 

Once again, I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don’t have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I’ll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I’m expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I’m also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy but I will definitely be opening a position soon with plans to hold it the next 36 years. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this DD that I wrote up for my friends and my discord. Please leave any additional info I might have left out as it pertains to NEE or any other stocks that you like and why. Hopefully this attempt doesn't kill everyone's eyes.","['UPS', 'NEE', 'DUK', 'SPGI', 'GOOGL']"

I recently (April 2020) invested $5000 (10% of my savings didn’t want to go crazy) into qantas an Australian airline company, here is my reasoning;

- The stock market had one of the biggest crashes since GFC, Qantas had gone from $6.3 to $2.3. 

-Being Qantas is one of the largest airline companies in the world also the third oldest, having this cashflow and reputation I thought they would be the most likely to open back up operation when coronavirus ends and even on the off chance be a monopoly of the Australian airline market (at least for a little while aha).

-airline stocks are obviously not desirable or demanded in a time like this as international and even domestic flights ceased, but in the future will most likely increase.

- people instead of investing in this time are saving it for future hardship, I would rather invest some of my capital rather than keep it in a >1%p.a bank account.

Those were the reasons I invested a portion of my savings, again I am no expert and would love feedback on my decision! Currently the stock is sitting at 5.5$ and growing! International travel hasn’t even opened back up in Australia so I am excited to see if it goes even higher.",

mole90,,StockMarket,post,1618120323,"What’s with all the market crash sentiment? 

So, recently I’ve seen an increase in posts that are stating that a market crash is on the horizon.

I’m not very concerned, as there hasn’t been a time where the market has crashed and not recovered.

I know about fears of inflation rising, as well as the market currently being perceived as overvalued.

My question is, where are the signs of an upcoming crash (if any)?

In general, what are the signs to look out for?

**EDIT AND UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your responses. Some comments in this post are quite complex for an investor like me lol, but in general I’ve got the idea that all of these stimulus checks, the unemployment numbers, the overvaluation, the excessive money printing, the sneakiness and deceptiveness, all of it shows that a market crash is on it’s way, but that it’s not something to be very worried about for the immediate future.**

**I’ve seen people’s estimates range from next week to never lol, but what I’ve learnt from this is that it’s not possible to totally predict a crash, although they are indicators and events that suggest one may be nearby, and that it’s good to have a decent cash reserve on hand to buy at lower prices and to average down.**

I'm a little flummoxed by the legal side of the CRISPR battle at present so I'm hoping someone on here can shed some light on the situation.

My understanding is that the legal battle for the patent is based on a scientific disagreement over who ""invented"" the use of CRISPR-CAS9 technology for humans. One side demonstrated it's use first in other types of cells, while the other took the logical next step in pushing the tech forward. When I read up on the patent however, it appears to be granting rights to the use of CRISPR on any eukaryotic cell, so I'm really unsure as to why this patent is currently owned by Broad and not the original research team.

In addition to this, since it's looking like Broad (and hence $EDIT) is coming out on top, what are the implications of this for agricultural uses of the technology? As far as I'm aware, EDIT is primarily investing in pharmaceutical based research, but a patent for all eukaryotic usage extends far beyond that. Are they likely to be a solid investment from the agricultural side simply because of the royalties?

mobs99,gu2xcop,StockMarket,comment,1618088189,"Recently I rewatched some of his videos, also I have his book one up on wallstreeet. I wonder what hes up to nowadays. Just enjoying life with all that wealth? Seems like hes very quiet.

Edit: Just read an interview by barrons from 2019. His interests are oil, energy. Im pretty sure he started underforming ever since tech is winning. His last words in the interview were just as wise as ever really:

""If you’re going to invest, you have to follow certain rules. If you want to ski, you ought to go to the bunny hill and learn how to stop. It doesn’t make you an Olympic skier, but then in certain cases, you have an edge on the Fidelitys of the world. You might be in the cement industry, and suddenly orders pick up. You can see things better. The one thing I want everybody who is buying individual stocks to get is that they have to understand the story, the five reasons something is going to go right for the company. If you can’t convince an 8-year-old why you own this thing, you probably shouldn’t own it. Don’t invest in a company before you look at the financials. If you made it through fifth grade, you can handle the math. """,['HES']

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

edit: New format for legibility, it was a mess.

**I was reading about:**

The IEX (Investors Exchange): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX), this exchange purports to be an exchange that is friendly to retail investors.

""IEX's main innovation is a 38-mile (61 km) coil of [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber)placed  in front of its trading engine. This 350 microsecond delay  adds  a   round-trip delay of 0.0007 seconds and is designed to negate  the    certain speed advantages utilized by some high-frequency traders.""

Additionally they created the D-Limit Order to fight High Frequency Traders.

[https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw\_wcB#/121](https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw_wcB#/121)

&#x200B;

**The possible DFV references:**

On March 26th DFV made a few tweets that didn't seem to make sense.

DFV tweeted Flash Gordon a possible reference to the IEX as detailed in [*Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys:_A_Wall_Street_Revolt) by Michael Lewis.

DFV tweeted a cat slapping a drone, which is a possible reference to fighting the robotic or Trading Algos.

*Thanks to* [*u/TabrisSeele*](https://www.reddit.com/u/TabrisSeele/)  *for contributed this link:* [*https://iextrading.com/trading/*](https://iextrading.com/trading/)*, it lists brokerages that will send trades to them.*

***Common Question:***  ""Hey how come I see Citadel listed on IEX's website?""

IEX  is an exchange, like the NYSE, people trade there.  It doesn't make  sense for Citadel to limit who they trade with, but they will have a  disadvantage when trading there due to the ""Speed Bump"" time delay.

&#x200B;

*Contributed by* [u/OG\_simple\_rhyme\_time](https://www.reddit.com/user/OG_simple_rhyme_time)

*This is from an article from one of the DDs from yesterday that appeared in 2015, who knows how bad its got since then:*

*""In  Connect, Citadel makes active retail orders it has bought from  retail  brokerages available to institutional investors and other firms.*

*Very  few stock orders that retail investors place with their brokers,  such  as Charles Schwab Corp, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity, go through  public  stock exchanges, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s New York  Stock  Exchange. Instead, the brokers send the orders to other brokerage   firms like Citadel, or KCG Holdings, which trade against the incoming   orders, and then send the leftovers to other internalizers, dark pools,   or as a last resort, exchanges.*

*By  doing this, the retail brokers not only avoid paying fees to the   exchanges for active orders, but actually receive payments and trading   rebates from the off-exchange trading venues.""*

*All the brokers we think are clean, are doing all of retail very dirty. GLE*

&#x200B;

**How to route orders to a different exchange:**

Seems even routing to NYSE or ARCA directly is better than the default for many brokers who use Dark Pools/Citadel as a standard.

If you don't have a brokerage that will allow routing **DON'T PANIC.**  It is not necessary for people to switch, no broker is perfect (I see your Dark Pool Fidelity!).  Stay where you are, the squeeze will happen or not.  This post was more about **AWARENESS**  of the options you may have when placing trades in the stock market.

&#x200B;

**ETrade Pro**

This is how I change it in ETrade Pro.  I cannot find a way to change it  using the WebPortal or Power ETrade.  It looks like it is locked behind  Pro account requirements.

**TD Ameritrade** *Contributed by* [*u/loldavelol*](https://www.reddit.com/u/loldavelol/)

*TDAmeritrade offers Direct Order   Routing to the Exchanges. ""Direct Routing,"" as TDA calls it, allows you   to select a routing destination for your stock or options order.*

***It is a feature that must be enabled. It is disabled by default.***

*When disabled, all orders on TDA are submitted via* [*\[""Smart Routing""\]*](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/order-execution.page)*, listed at the bottom of the page:*

>*Execution quality statistics provided by S3 Matching Technologies*

*Which, if is the same S3 that reports SI, was recently learned to be owned by Citadel* [*\[1\]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2xrj/the_s3_partners_ownership_rabbithole/) *&* [*\[2\]*](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo2811/let_me_tell_you_the_tale_of_s3_partners_a/)

*Once   Direct Routing is Enabled, this allows users to circumvent Kenny G  from  poaching orders by routing orders directly to the exchange floor  via  IEX, instead of through Citadel and NYSE/ARCA.*

*The downsides:*

* *Orders may not get the best pricing (pennies on the share, TDA quotes savings $1.27 per 100 shares)*
* *Might be more susceptible to partial fills (IE: $135 for 10 might fill for 3 until 7 more are found).*
* *IEX is also only available during regular market hours, so no access to AM/PM trading.*

*Unfortunately, on TDA, IEX orders have to be submitted from the Stock Buy/Sell Screen and cant be routed from SnapTicket.*

***Conclusion:***

*If GME buyers started routing orders from their brokers through IEX then we would* *~~apply massive buying pressure to the share price away from the NYSE flow that Citadel Controls~~* *bypass Citadel as the MM.*

*Bonus, Citadel sued the SEC after approving IEX as a pathway to the stock market.* [*\[1\]*](https://www.google.com/search?q=citadel+iex&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS821US821&oq=&aqs=chrome.2.69i59i450l8.564081j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

>*“The   SEC failed to properly consider the costs and burdens imposed by this   proposal that will undermine the reliability of our markets and harm   tens of millions of retail investors,” a Citadel Securities spokeswoman   said in an email on Friday.*

*Sounds like IEX is a threat to Citadel's position as an NYSE DMM.*

**TD DI** *Contributed by* [u/aholl50](https://www.reddit.com/user/aholl50)

*Hey so I looked into TD  Direct Investing (TD DI) for Canadian apes using TD Canada Trust and it  seems all US-listed equities are routed through the TD Ameritrade arm  and are subject to TDA default best execution protocol. Unfortunately, I  cannot find any information on WebBroker for choosing a different  exchange when buying using TD DI. Seems like Canadian apes using TD DI  don't have the option of switching exchanges in this case, hoping others  can keep digging and find more info or a potential alternative versus  switching brokers.*

*Sources: (*[*https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/documents/pdf/direct-investing/client-disclosure-best-execution-and-fair-pricing\_EN.pdf*](https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/documents/pdf/direct-investing/client-disclosure-best-execution-and-fair-pricing_EN.pdf)*)  page 5 covers US Equities this then points me to this TDA document which confirms the above info  regarding the need for opting in to direct routing as described (*[*https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en\_us/resources/pdf/TDA100533.pdf*](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA100533.pdf)*)*

&#x200B;

In my trading career beyond having a strategy (actually multiple depending on market state and asset class) to base my trades on nothing has ever been as important as having a Trading plan. In this post I want to share with you my personal trading plan to help you create a set of rules that will help you stick to your plan and keep your emotions in check so that you can actually follow your trading strategy and become a consistently profitable trader.

Something that was and still is key for me is the following realization:

Never get attached to your opinion or view of why something should happen. The market is in fact always right and based on nothing but irrationality since its made by humans so the movements of the market do not have to make sense and at more times than not will not make sense.

Trading is simply a mind game. Markets are a result of mass psychology which leads to exploitable edges. Mastering your own psychology is key to keep following the strategy that defines your edge.

So now without further ado my trading plan template that has helped me so much over the years and I hope will help you as well:

**\*\*General Rules\*\***

1. Never enter a trade without a plan (TP,SL)
2. Once you are in a trade stick to the plan
3. Its ok to be wrong its not about being right its about making money
4. Be patient do not act on FOMO
5. Do not chase the market
6. Let your winners run and cut your losses short

**\*\*The 5 fundamental truths\*\***

1. Anything can happen.
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money.
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge.
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another.
5. Every moment in the market is unique.

**\*\*Rules of consistency\*\*I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE:**

1. I objectively identify my edges.
2. I have predefined risk of every trade.
3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them.

**\*\*Risk and Money Management\*\***

Do not increase the standard trade size before you doubled the account.

1. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose in a day is $XXX.

 2. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose on any single trade is $XXX.

 3. The maximum number of losing trades in a row you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is two. 

4. The maximum number of losing trades you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is five. (You may have had a win or two between losses, but there is a time to stop trading.) The maximum number of losing trades in the same direction you are allowed to take in a day before you stop trading is three.

 1. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the current price to protect a portion of those profits. 

2. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will take the money and close out the trade.

 3. If you are up $XXX for the day, you will take the rest of the day off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading

4. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the month's profits to protect a portion of those profits. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will take the rest of the month off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading! Take a vacation, sleep late and read books, or do something else fun.

I created this trading plan years ago and am only sharing it with the community now (never spent much time on social media). It is a mix of my own ideas, ideas from fellow traders and books I have read over the years. One book in particular that I highly recommend and that has hugely influenced my trading plan and journey as a trader is: Trading In The Zone from Mark Douglas.",

mq2kxl,,wallstreetbets,post,1618321598,"Inflation impulse sets off precious metals, once they get going it can snowball quickly. Some advice for anyone looking to jump into Silver or GoldThis is a quick DD just getting a few facts out there in case anyone searches WSB for gold or silver today in light of inflation picking up.

The fed is likely to cap rates as they respond to to higher inflation.  They might not announce anything, but look at the size of their purchases when the data comes out.  In many ways they’ve already begun YCC.

This means that as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall because nominal yields are capped.  This is extremely positive for gold and silver.

I prefer silver to gold because in a raging bull market for PMs, silver will greatly outperform gold.

Silver’s industrial and jewelry use is coming closer to eclipsing the annual production. You may not know that silver is used in solar panels, electric cars, and really anything that’s electronic and expensive. This is because it is the most conductive of all elements.  If you are bullish on green tech, silver is a natural play. As monetary demand comes in, it just doesn’t have the capacity to absorb it, which is why it can spike.

You may remember the silver squeeze movement that took off for about 3 days on WSB back in late January.  Barely anyone joined that train as virtually everyone was still playing GME (and still are, keep holding GME brothers) and yet it still had a fairly large impact.

The supply situation is far tighter today than it was 2.5 months ago, so people jumping in the silver train now will be far more impactful. 

Also, we’ve learned that SLV is a scam, and silver surfers probably shot themselves in the face by buying it.

Here’s a very long DD that explains it. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Broken into 3 parts, that DD addresses SLV being a scam, the silver short squeeze, and the fundamental case for silver.

Essentially to properly buy silver through an ETF you need to buy PSLV, not SLV.

In the silver squeeze world there are many ways to play it,

PSLV is like buying shares, it directly contributes to the snowballing of the squeeze. It’s also highly marginable so you can get a leveraged pure play on the metal if you want

Miners are like call options on the metal, but also frequently mine other things than just silver and carry political risk and other types of risk, not a complete pure play, but some of them can be very close

There are also call options on miners. 

Most of the miners are too small in terms of market cap to post here unfortunately.

If you want more info go read the longer DD I posted in the link above!

PSLV, not SLV




Also:  PSLV was also banned on Robinhood a few months ago, so if you are still using that shitty broker please switch to one that won’t try to screw your at every turn",['AMP']

# What is Delta Neutral?

Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative [deltas](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.

I'm not going to explain what delta is in any level of depth. If you don't know what it is get the fuck out of this forum and go read on the internet. We often thing of delta as a rate of change in price of our option but it's anything but static.

Delta neutral is actually very simple. You sum all of your positions for a particular underlying. If it's 0 congrats you're delta neutral. Delta neutral is ideal but it's nearly impossible to maintain because price changes so often. If you're an MM that's fine you have billions at your disposal but most of us can't do that shit.

Simple example: You have a put with a delta of -.3 and you have 30 shares.

The short position

1 Put ( 100 \* -.3 = -30 Delta)

The long position

30 shares = (30 \* +1 = 30 Delta)

30Delta (long) + -30 Delta (short) => Delta Neutral (0)

Let's say the price goes down and now your put is now Delta = -.35 (gamma of -0.05)

Your short position has now created a delta negative position which means you disproportionately benefit if 📉 but you get rekt if 📈. To get your position back in balance you would need to acquire 5 shares.

New positions post price movement of $1

The short position

1 Put (100 \* -.35 = -35 Delta )

The long position

35 shares = (35 \* +1Delta = 35Delta)

Okay great... now do it every time the price changes a dollar up or down.

No surprise you can't keep doing this shit. This level of day trading isn't in the cards for most of us.

Why does delta change?

The closer an option is to ITM or further ITM the closer it will converge to 1:1 ratio of price change. I say converge because options can not have 0 or 1 delta. The fact that they have extrinsic value means it's impossible. Say you have a 1C on underlying that's 5000. You're $4999 ITM which means the intrinsic value of the option is going to nearly mirror the movement of the underlying price. If you have a 5000C on a call that's underlying $1. Congrats you wasted money and your delta is likely around .0001 or something stupid like that.

Let's look at it graphically since I know you fucking idiots don't like reading.

Gaze 'pon ye olde Delta chart for calls.

Obviously these are approximations but the key takeaway is that delta is asymptotic. That means it will never be 0 or 1, it will change rapidly around the middle and rapidly decelerate toward the ends. I feel like we covered this enough. I don't want to distract you retards from jerking off to only fans and watching that show you've seen for the 9th time through.

A final peak on an actual option chain so you can observe the curve.

[https://preview.redd.it/rqr62cq8ias61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcdc607de18253a85a0c5b83f05b73071c55bbe2](https://preview.redd.it/rqr62cq8ias61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcdc607de18253a85a0c5b83f05b73071c55bbe2)

You can see the proximity to price with respect to strike is what correlates to the delta. Delta is a function of difference between underlying price, strike price of position and gamma. That's an oversimplification but you don't want to see the math formulas do you?

Here's an example case I made to observe change in Delta over price change for a single long position.

[Don't be fucking stupid. Delta converges at 1. I'm just lazy and didn't add the MIN formula to the excel sheet. In this example I chose around 110 for the ITM mark.](https://preview.redd.it/wi3rmq7gias61.png?width=290&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ef93f01bb4f3e2e4c0b46a44da206600a795d8)

This is why the FDs sometimes print harder than jpow... just kidding jpow. But seriously this is the dream we all look for when it comes to buying options. Watching something far otm get good price movement and watching gamma inject delta with massive print potential for us.

Don't be deceived by this example. Gamma is not static. Gamma is 0 when you're ITM as you can't have a Delta above 1. Gamma is also nearly 0 when you're so far OTM that it basically doesn't matter. Say if you bought a 800c on something trading for like 180... which I'm sure no one here every does.

Look at this actual gamma curve.

[https://preview.redd.it/75h0wbofjas61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3d4a5f2430dd0c337d81cdf97fbc0afd7d6153](https://preview.redd.it/75h0wbofjas61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3d4a5f2430dd0c337d81cdf97fbc0afd7d6153)

In the middle of the bell curve is where delta is basically .5. small shifts in underlying change cause massive shift in option price change relatively speaking. Again when you're on the fringes => super ITM or super OTM your gamma is 0 because your delta really can't change unless it completely violently reverses itself.

# Gamma Squeeze

There's been a ridiculous amount of talk about gamma squeezes and very little talk about how they mechanically work. Again I'll keep this brief and try to use pictures so I don't hurt anyone's smooth brain. JK read a book retard.

Remember that we talked about delta neutral positions and how it's important as a market maker to remain delta neutral to mitigate risks. Well gamma squeezes are actually fairly simple and I think I've explained it before but not as elaborately as this. The way it must work is the buying pressure of the short position holders to become delta neutral or cover their positions must thrust the price upward triggering delta changes which then again trigger more covering and delta neutral buying. I made some pictures for you dickheads.

# Warning: This next image has math

[https://preview.redd.it/k2kg08p46bs61.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce64da8f8fef106bc815fe01a193207a55589a5](https://preview.redd.it/k2kg08p46bs61.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce64da8f8fef106bc815fe01a193207a55589a5)

Here's an example of a failure. This shows that although there was a proper ladder of options bought that could have forced the gamma squeeze there simply was not enough buying pressure in the period to force the gamma squeeze. Take a very close look at some of the option levels. Stupid humans like round numbers for some reason so we like to buy lots of options around the '50' or '100' levels in underlying. This is a fictional piece I made up that should illustrate the point.

[https://preview.redd.it/imtdd8yd1bs61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c55589e36441728cde6a695ffd9748a3139ec92](https://preview.redd.it/imtdd8yd1bs61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c55589e36441728cde6a695ffd9748a3139ec92)

Do not obsess over this silly little picture. It's impossible to make excel really show gamma squeeze because excel does not like circular references and that's literally what I'm trying to explain.

I thought I was fucking up my excel formulas and then I realized that no fuck you excel, gamma squeezes are in fact a self perpetuating problem and effectively a circular reference. So I can't show you a perfect excel sheet that works.

I couldn't even calculate the Actual delta because it's dependent on price movements which are dependent on shares needed to cover which is dependent on delta etc.

Take note that the buying in the column is far less than the shares needed to cover the short sold positions. But what if there was more buying pressure on the underlying? Say we got those shares we needed to push the price up. We'd start to see a chain reaction. The short position holders would increasingly become the buyers of long shares.

Look at the left ""Gamma Movements"" That's the same as the number the price on the underlying has increased by one. A gamma movement as I'm describing it is an action in buying sufficient enough to push the price up by $1. This causes gamma to increase delta which then causes more buying from the short position holders to be gamma neutral and the cycle continues.

The key is to have enough ATM/ITM options to force gamma neutral hedging. I already explained that ATM and ITM have the highest delta and thus will cause the most hedging for short position holders. Those ATM/ITM positions are also the most profitable / least risky in the event of a failure to sqoz.

It's outrageously odd to see a proper gamma squeeze happen so don't bank on seeing one any time soon. I just wanted to try to illuminate some of these mechanics as I understand them.

My explanations aren't perfect because I'm not. At least I'm putting something effort into it.

\*EDIT: This was the my original DD post on VIAC, pre-hedgy collapse. I am still VERY BULLISH on the stock, and recent events have opened a new opportunity for those who felt they missed the VIAC rocket to get on. The rocket has come back for you retards! Are you getting on this time, or will you stay and watch from afar like before?

👁️👁️👁️

\-Also, my price targets have not changed, but I do think the timing needs to be readjusted, but hey who knows what the future entails? Stranger things have happened....I just really like the stock!

👁️👁️👁️

That being said, welcome fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates! There has been much DD already surrounding VIAC but I will repost all the links for you guys to read up on as we go along so you dont have to search for it on reddit. With the current battle going with GME, AMC and the hedgies, this ticker was easily overlooked.

VIAC has many things going for it, so excuse me if this shit seems all over the place. the more you read and understand, then the more you may agree that VIAC is a good investment.

Now lets talk about the GIANT that is ViacomCBS.

ViacomCBS comprises four major units:

* CBS Entertainment Group consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television, CBS Television Stations, and CBS Interactive. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.\[47\]
* Domestic Media Networks encompasses the pay television channels owned byViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix. ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* International Networks encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third\[48\] of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18.\[49\] This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.
* Global Distribution Group focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

Other assets owned by ViacomCBS include the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, the company's flagship subscription streaming service Paramount+, over-the-top ad-supported video-on-demand platform Pluto TV, book publisher Simon & Schuster, multi-genre online video conference VidCon, mixed martial arts promoter Bellator, and media and entertainment company AwesomenessTV. As of November 2019, AwesomenessTV is overseen by its co-founder Brian Robbins, an executive for ViacomCBS Domestic. The company also has an undisclosed stake in FuboTV, acquired in 2020.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS)

For a list of all assets owned by ViacomCBS: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_assets\_owned\_by\_ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_ViacomCBS)

Viacom's audience reach is very broad, as their content is vast and appeals to all kinds of demographics. Let's talk about just Paramount Plus alone for. I know a bunch of fucktards didnt like the release of P+ but its not about just yourself, its about the potential appeal to other people who have likes and dislikes that differ from yourself.

P+ not only has a ton of content but also LIVE FUCKING SPORTS!!!!! Here's a look at the more than 1,000 live games P+ is bringing to the table:

* THE NFL ON CBS
* The Masters
* NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship
* PGA TOUR
* SEC ON CBS
* The PGA Championship
* National Women's Soccer League
* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League -- *Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.*

In addition, Paramount+ is expanding its exclusive English-language rights in the U.S. with three more soccer properties, featuring hundreds of additional matches.

* Concacaf -- offering more than 200 Concacaf matches, starting with the Concacaf Nations League Finals in June of this year, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team. Coverage will feature all 41 national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean across different competitions, including the qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, which will feature the defending champion U.S. Women's National Team.
* Liga Profesional de Futbol -- Paramount+ will stream more than 300 matches a year from Argentina's top soccer division.
* Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A -- Paramount+ will stream more than 360 matches a year from Brazil's premier soccer league.

The service will also be the exclusive home of a long-running, original series ***Inside the NFL***. And knowing fans don't stop watching when the players stop playing, Paramount+ will feature CBS Sports HQ.

This is a no brainer. Sports brings in YUUUUUGE revenue and viewership and P+ will have many different kinds of sports that appeal to all kinds of viewers across the globe. Soccer is literally the most popular and watched sport in the world. Honestly from the sports side, all P+ is missing is Cricket. March Madness alone has broken revenue records and the month isn't even over!!!!! Even if corona were to shut it down, VIAC has already gotten more profit than they anticipated, any additional profit are just more blessings!

P+ will also have a bunch of original content coming in the next coming years. Here you can find a list of content coming to P+. [https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/](https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/)

The one that caught my interest the most was Halo. I remember I bought the Xbox console SOLEY for that game alone, along with millions of other fans. I suspect this alone would bring a lot of attention when released to P+.

ViacomCBS also has A LOT of their content licensed out to other companies such as Amazon and Netflix. ""Coming to America 2"" was made by Paramount Studios yet is streaming on Amazon. Why? Because of the shit ton of revenue it brings them.

""When Disney began developing Disney+, it reclaimed every last piece of programming it had licensed to Netflix (though Disney films released between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 may return to Netflix in 2026). In doing so, the Mouse House sacrificed hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative licensing revenue in order to build an exclusive in-house library. Yet Paramount Pictures spent 2020 selling off most of its theatrical features to rival streamers while Paramount Network licensed cable’s biggest hit (Yellowstone) exclusively to Peacock. Why? Because ViacomCBS President & CEO of Streaming Tom Ryan believes strategic licensing can be a boom for Paramount+ long-term even if it costs the streamer exclusive access."" See: [https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/](https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/)

Netflix has gotten significant attention for its massive spending on content. Over the last year, the company's spending on content topped $14.6 billion. ViacomCBS suggested it spent about $13 billion last year on content. It's no secret that spending on content seems to drive streaming revenue. However, some are speculating the company's recently announced $2.5 billion debt offering could be an act of desperation. There is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge, yet ViacomCBS seems to be positioned better than some of its peers.

For those worried about closed movie theaters, last quarter the company's theatrical revenue equaled just under 2% of total revenue. It's true that advertising makes up the bulk of the company's revenue, yet the company's consistent high-quality content should continue to attract ad dollars. When people are stuck at home, it's likely they are going to watch more video. Whether that means Pluto TV, the traditional CBS, Showtime, or CBS All Access, the company should be able to grow its audience. As the public health crisis eventually fades, the returning ad dollars, combined with a bigger audience, should serve investors and the company well.

As proof that streaming seems to be the future of ViacomCBS, the company's subscription and video advertising business is expected to grow by 35% to 40%. ViacomCBS has multiple offerings driving its streaming business. The company's Pluto TV service increased its monthly active users in the U.S. by 75% annually. Paid streaming subscriptions increased by 50% year over year domestically. On the flip side, Netflix is witnessing a split in its membership growth. On the domestic side of the house, Netflix's paid memberships increased by a pedestrian 4.4% annually. International has become the company's growth engine, with paid memberships increasing by more than 31% year over year.

Though both ViacomCBS and Netflix are reporting solid growth in subscribers, the former generates significant free cash flow. In the past 12 months, ViacomCBS generated core free cash flow (FCF) of over $3.4 billion.

The coronavirus may challenge ViacomCBS' short-term results and cause volatility. However, with a yield of nearly 6% an almost comically low payout ratio, and a growing streaming business, this represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Don't forget Netflix is also cracking down on password sharing. As far as I know, P+ can be shared and streamed on multiple devices at once. I am always streaming my P+ on my computer 24/7 and can watch a soccer match from my mobile device at the same time. Also, P+ doesn't ask me if I am ""still watching"" like Netflix does after some time.

ViacomCBS also owns Paramount Pictures, a movie studio that has produced so much great content over the years. Last time I checked, movie theaters are PACKED and movie revenue will continue to explode as we get closer to the summer and as we get more people vaccinated.

Another interesting thing regarding ViacomCBS is that is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 24.22, much lower than Netflix(85.21), yet Netflix doesn't offer live sports or news and does not generate cable revenue. ViacomCBS is still undervalued and has a lot of room for growth. As of now, the public float of shares is around 543 million shares, while the amount of shares shorted on VIAC is about 19.36% (around 105 million shares). Along with that, there is high institutional ownership of shares (currently 93.86%, see: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional)) and is very possible that an there potential an activist investor has been buying up shares since August of last year. (see:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge))

Institutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong, daily uptrend. With such high institutional ownership and very low insider ownership (0.2% of total float), that leaves about 6% of shares left available (543 million shares).

see:[http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/](http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/)

Viacom operates a largely decentralized business model. It gets almost 80% of its revenues through a collection of network channels that include MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, CMT, BET, and Spike. The rest of its revenues come from Paramount Pictures (film) and Harmonix (video games).

Those subsidiaries have their own management teams that are silo-ed off to act in their own self interest. Even when Sumner Redstone was in his physical prime and applied a micro-managing spirit to his holdings, he wasn’t make individual business decisions–he was firing the managers of his subsidiaries for not meeting his short-term expectations. This isn’t Steve Jobs orchestrating the iPhone; Sumner Redstone did not bring you SpongeBob.

While most Viacom shareholders are understandably paying attention to the public spat over board control, that is not the issue that would keep me up at night if I were a long-term shareholder. Considering that 80% of revenues come from network channels, my predominant focus would be: How many minutes are being delivered per month by the channels we own?

We’ve had four nasty recessions in the past century. These are illustrative for helping us figure out the durability of a company’s profits during times of deep distress and aid us in quantifying the harm posed by perceived risks. In the case of Viacom, it actually grew profits from $2.38 per share in 2008 to $2.56 per share in 2009. Profits went from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion even as minutes distributed through the network channels declined by 5%. Advertising rates plummeted, and minutes watched declined by a little bit, and yet the media giant still churned out more cash.

Viacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings. It has repurchased 35% of its stock since 2010, taking the share count down from 608 million to 390 million. Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Profits have declined $200 million from $2.2 billion to $2.0 billion over the past five years. That also coincides with a significant period of buybacks so that earnings have actually grown from $3.78 per share in 2011 to somewhere in the low $5 range right now.

Put another way: Viacom the corporation has seen profits decline by 1.89% per year over the last five years, while Viacom shareholders have seen their profits climb by 6.17% per year over the past five years.

Edit: good read and news, more income for VIAC - [https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs)

The Play:

I believe VIAC will see $175 or higher by EOY. I already have several calls at different strikes, but I plan on getting many more far OTM calls with 2023 expirations and plan on getting more shares. I believe anything after 4/16 expiration with $90-120 strikes would be a good call to look at.

👁️👁️👁️

\*EDIT: Although I still believe $175 EOY is possible, I think $150 is more likely and conservative. I can very much so see this stock at $200 in 2022. I have already gotten OTM LEAPS and will hold on to them like your wife holds her boyfriend at night. For shorter term calls, I would look at $52-$60 calls with at least 2-3 months to expiration, obviously more time is better. This week will be important, if the sell momentum has died down, the only other direction this stock can go is: UP!

👁️👁️👁️

Also I am anticipating YUGE sub growth in this year and next. Even if you hate their streaming service, I'm willing to be that you have watched at least 1 VIAC produced show or movie on any of the other stream services you do like and subscribe to. They are going to make money either from you directly subscribing or you watching their content on other services....\*cough\*coming to america 2\*cough\*....

👁️👁️👁️

I can imagine a scenario where others who like the stock also like and support the stream with a sub, and unlike other services like Netflix that stops streaming after some time asking you ""are you still watching"", Paramount Plus doesn't. I mean hey, I LOVE VIAC and I LOVE P+ so much that I just  
👁️watch👁️ shows 24/7. I would love to 👁️watch👁️ all their content, although I do fall asleep at sometimes, but the shows and movies keep playing, so I NEVER MISS OUT. Even while at work, on my other computer I leave the shows 👁️playing👁️ so I NEVER MISS ANYTHING. Could you imagine others loving the stock and company like I do, 👁️watching👁️ all their content NONSTOP? I could only imagine their upcoming 👁️earnings report👁️ would be insane in that case, and would do wonders to my lovely stock... but again, I'm retarded so what the hell do I know right?

👁️👁️👁️

If you know, you know.... 👁️👁️👁️

Now I also believe there may be a great opportunity here for those who has been hurt or downed in the battle of GME and AMC, and there has been MANY. Look to VIAC as the healing spell that has been cast on the market. VIAC can rejuvenate your tendies, so you can have more ammo to fight against the hedgies! Should you choose let VIAC heal you, I suggest you leave some tendies with VIAC to continue to grow and multiply, just in case if you go back and goto the GME or AMC fight and get hurt or down in battle once again. That way you can return to the VIAC tendies you had left and didnt touch, which have now created tendie clones that you can use once again in the GME and AMC battle, should you choose to do so! For the battle of GME and AMC will be long and drawn out, you must be adequately prepared!!! TENDIES MAKES MORE TENDIES!!!!

VIAC is the water of life, it heals all those who are weary from battle! Use this power wisely, fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates!

AGAIN, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!!! I AM VERY RETARDED, I LOVE TO EAT CRAYONS, MY FAVORITE IS THE GREEN ONE, IT TASTES LIKE $100 BILLS!!

But if AMD can't hold a price level above 80 after releasing Milan CPUs (spoiler: it didn't), I don't know what it will take. I've been rooting for them since $8 (long before I started playing the market) and maybe their share price has simply grown too fast to keep going.

mpqxbf,,wallstreetbets,post,1618272874,"My Update on UWMC: The Equivalent of Counting Cards at the Blackjack Table Baby, or Why are ya'll tripping on this fine Stock?So, I wanted to wait a period of time before writing a update to my due diligence. Some of you might remember my last two due diligences. Well, I’m happy to say that I’ve bought more. So, let’s actually get to the meat and potatoes.  If you want some theme music for how some of you people with a bad case of FUD who are holding UWMC are feeling I'd recommend Balduin & Wolfgang Lohr - Dizzy (ft. Alanna). Bonus points if you know the anime/light novel and get the meta meme within.

Please note that this is based on historical monthly median single family home values in the US, that the data is non-seasonally adjusted, and that it is based on sales of existing homes.

· The Median Home Price was $303,900 in January.

· The Median Home Price was $317,100 in February.

· In February, the supply of inventory ticked up by .1 to 2 Months indicating huge demand, and an extreme sellers-market, indicating that home prices will have increased when data in March 2021 is shed on the 25th.

If you would like to do some more research, you can find the NAR data here: [Housing Statistics (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics).

While it is true that existing home sales fell, it is not due to a bubble, but due to supply constraints and unrestrained demand. What you can be assured of however is five things, for Q1 of 2021:

1. On a seasonally adjusted basis, home sales have increased as you can see in the NAR data. Furthermore, the per home sale profit has increased due to month-on-month price increases. This is because originations usually cost .5-1% of a home’s value. With UWMC’s increasing margin due to its technology, gain margin should continue, and has been shown to have grown YoY.
2. UWMC has put out guidance of between $52 Billion and $57 of closed loan volume. Last quarter they had $54.7 Billion in 4Q20. On the Mad Money Interview with Cramer, the man said they were on track to land right around the middle of that. That provides, impetus for me to believe they will meet, or exceed guidance. They had Net Income of $1,001,925,000 after the impact of an estimated effective tax rate of 27% in Q4 of 2020. Total Gain Margin may be a little lower, as they are stating they will have a gain margin of 200-235 Basis Points, as opposed to 305 Basis Points in Q4 2020.
3. It is important to know that while they do refinance, their bread and butter is and always has been the purchase market. However, in 2020, however, they turned off FHA loans, and Jumbo loans out of an abundance of caution. This meant that while they made a massive $3.38 Billion in net income, their actual purchase volume decreased to $42.9 Billion, as compared to $49.8 Billion in total purchase volume in FY19. As UWMC has returned to doing these offerings, we can expect purchase volume to increase, and offset refinance volume (which is still going very strong, even if it is lower YoY).
4. As mortgage rates increased, they remained far below the 2019 Interest Rate, and have recently ticked down. Furthermore, UWMC’s rates compared to retail are 15 basis points better (.15%), which equates to roughly $28 in savings per month for consumers. Furthermore, selling a home takes a median of 25 days (the fastest rate ever), and down from 40 days the year before). Moreover, 46% of properties went under contract within a single week and 59% did so within two weeks. However, the time to close is extremely high for Mortgage companies and the average is 58 days on average. However, UWMC’s is 18 days, and it was 16 in December (whereas competitors time to close increased. The Broker Channel is faster, and cheaper, for consumers and that should scale well as the wholesale market continues to take market share generally.
5. Their issuance of a 700-Million-dollar senior note with a 5.5% interest rate to pay off an MSR facility, and for general corporate purposes is a bullish sign as it indicates to me they are experiencing heavy volume and want to grab as much market share as possible.

Going Forward:

1. The sale of lots, and the issuance of permits is red hot, and you can start seeing a lot more inventory coming online later in 2021 and throughout 2022. Furthermore, demand going forward should still be strong for a few years at minimum (if, probably, lower than 2020-2021).
2. “The population of 25- to 34-year-olds is 9% larger than the 35- to 44-year-old group, signaling to homebuilders that a wave of demand is on the horizon. The bank's modeling suggests monthly housing starts will land between 1.7 million and 2 million through 2024, markedly higher than the February reading of 1.4 million.” – Straight from the Jeffrey’s Analyst here ([4 Reasons Jefferies Sees Long and Sustainable Boom in US Housing (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-sustainable-boom-homebuyers-mortgage-rates-millennials-construction-jefferies-2021-4) à I’m not going to mention the other points brought here.
3. Mortgage Servicing Rights, which UWMC has been acquiring more and more of will act as a hedge against higher inflation rates, and will also serve as a source of steady cash flow through good times and time when the housing market is slower. Considering the delinquency rate for applicants for UWMC is far lower than the average, due to their high FICO scores, this means that UWMC is well positioned.

However, this is not what I wanted to discuss. I wanted to discuss the share price, and the fact that the chances of UWMC issuing a stock buyback, issuing a special dividend, and/or increasing the dividend are extremely likely. Not least of all, because he said that they were looking to do so if there was excess cash, and it looks very likely that there will be. You can find their CEO talking about it on the Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript (Page 6 if I recall), or you can just listen to it all.

**The Stock Buyback**

Please remember the stock buyback authorization lets the company take advantage and buy at any time within a period. I also know that the price will go up on the declaration of earnings and a buyback, but I want to show some wicked math.

Before we look at a buyback, we should look at how much the annual dividend of .40 (A dividend Yield of 5.32%!), costs the company and if it is able to service its dividend and debts well. The annual dividend comes at around 640 Million, while the 1.5B of Senior Notes comes in at 82.5 Million in interest per year. The sum, therefore, is $722,500,000 that UWMC needs to pay out to shareholders, and to bondholders. Considering the first quarter alone will not only pay all that but leave around $300 Million, or more, in profit we can safely say that the dividend payout ratio is safe and that UWMC can easily service its debts.

However, perhaps you can see something here that I see? That is right. The dividend yield is almost as high as the interest rate on these senior notes. Stock buybacks are usually issued to increase prices, but also to improve earnings per share because the share count is decreased. **However,** I much prefer when they are issued on high yield dividend stocks and I will explain why here. This is because while it simultaneously increases earnings per share, it also substantially improves cash flow and profit and helps lower the share payout ratio. It does not matter if they are public float shares, or control shares, when it has a dividend. Either way your profit

Let us do some paper math. UWMC has 1.6 Billion in shares (all inclusive), and a market cap of 12.05 Billion. They have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes with an interest rate of 5.5%. Let us just go ahead and say that they wanted to do a share buyback of 1.5 Billion (I think this is too high, but I am conveying a point here). That would be 12.4% of all Shares in UWMC. If all these shares were purchased at exactly $7.50, that would equate to exactly 200 Million Shares. 200 Million Shares times the dividend yield (40 Cents!), is equivalent to 80 Million Dollars.

Therefore, between now and 2025, the interest payments on the 1.5 Billion Dollar in Senior Notes will be essentially paid off by the stock buyback. Furthermore, after 2025 there will only be the 700 Million Senior Note left, which means that there will only be interest payments of 38.5 Million per year until 2029 when the Senior Note is Due. That means that between 2025 and 2029, 166 Million will have been saved up and can be utilized to help pay 2029’s Senior Note’s Principal. From 2021 to 2029 UWMC will have saved up 640 Million that it otherwise would have had to pay over that 8-year period. Over a 10 YR period it will save 800 Million.

As the share price climbs lower (Yes, intended to say climb lower ha-ha because I like buying this cheap), it becomes more and more likely that UWMC is compelled to issue a share buyback as the dividend yield would surpass the senior notes interest & could lead to very significant savings.

However….

**The Stock Buy Back + Dividend Raise Trick**

If UWMC felt extremely bullish, and simultaneously wanted to indicate the markets needed to take it a lot more seriously it could do this sleight of hand. As it decreased the share count, and thus the annual yield by 12.5%, it could raise the dividend by 12.5% to 45 Cents. This would increase your annual dividend yield from 5.32% to 6% while simultaneously increasing EPS.

**Plus, a Special Dividend?**

I personally would rather they reinvest the money in the company than do a special dividend, but they have a fortress of a balance sheet with a good cash balance and equity, and strong free cash flow so…. They could declare a special dividend of .41-.42 cents, which is equivalent to Rocket’s 5.5% Special Dividend. Considering they made around $3.38 in net income last year, they could issue a stock buyback of 1.5Billion, pay the raised 640 Million annual dividend of .45, and do a special dividend costing another 640 Million. That would total 2.78B, leaving them with some profit for the year to put this in perspective. Considering taxes, they probably would be in the red by around 285 Million. Considering their strong cash reserves, they could do it however, but it is not something I’d do (at least with such a high special dividend). HOWEVER, I’d prefer they reinvest the money into new technology and growing market share than a special dividend as they own 35% of the wholesale broker channel’s market share and want to expand that to 50%.

**This Stock Will Pay You to Hold It on Margin**

Depending on your Brokerage, this stock will pay you to hold it. Robinhood Gold gives you the first 1,000 margin free, and thereafter 2.5% annual. IBKR starts at 1.59% and goes down from there.

Let us say you are placing $1000 on margin, and the annual interest rate is 2.5%. That means you pay 25 dollars in yearly interest. That is .068 cents a day. At 7.50, you can purchase 133.333 UWMC shares. That equates to $53.33 per year. A $28.33 profit.

Now, to have a paper loss the share price would need to decrease by 21 cents to $7.29. However, remember that the yield is making you money regardless, and if you believe it will go up long term you do not care. Where this matters however is collateral, or how much you need in your brokerage. I am extremely well capitalized on my utilization of margin so that the company would have to go bankrupt (go to 0) or near enough to it, before I would have to shift money around to make sure I am not margin called. Everyone has their risk tolerance. If you decide to make a play like this, you should know yours and work towards a allocation that is comfortable for you.

**The Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt**

There has been a lot of bemoaning regarding UWMC, and I can say it has felt a little bit like being DeepFuckingValue here before GME mooned. It has gotten to the point where someone gloatingly asked if I had sold yet like 1-2 weeks after I had posted a DD, and I told them I had bought more instead after it went down further.

I do not care about a daily return, or weekly returns. That is not to mean I do not do them on occasion, but there is such a thing as MoM returns. Especially if it is compounding. Say you have $50,000 last month invested in one stock. Next month, you sell for a 67 percent profit and now have $83,500. That is a month-on-month profit of 33.5%. You repeat that exact same scenario with $83,500, and that turns into $139,445. So over four months, through compounding, your total return is 278.98% for a 4-month period on your initial $50,000.

The only catalysts I care about are on May 5th, and May 7th. May 5th for Earnings, and May 7 because it is the Russel inclusion list for June Reconstitution. While I don’t really care about the Russel bump, for some reason some people seem to, and I can appreciate the fact that liquidity would increase as volume has been thin recently.

Let me be clear, I do not care if it goes down between now and then, and in point of fact, I **want** it to because I can keep averaging down and increase my MoM average. I bought more today. And if it goes down again, I’ll keep buying.

The only thing I care about is Forward EPS, and Dividend Payout Ratio. The Analysts think that the EPS FY 2021 will be 1.42. I know that is wrong, and outdated, because they expect only .4 in Q1 2021, and that goes against UWMC guidance completely. Let us say, conservatively, that they make 1 Billion in Net Income after taxes… 1B Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.625 EPS for Q1 2021. 800 Million in Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.5 EPS for Q1 2021. Regardless, I will just go ahead and state that .4 is fine. That quarter alone will pay off the dividend for the full year under the dividend payout ratio. The FY 1.42 Analyst Expectations (Which is wrong and potentially outdated?), means that the dividend payout ratio is 27.2% which is a very, very, good ratio. The Nasdaq Website shows the Forward P/E at 5.47 on the future EPS of 1.4. However, I believe that EPS for FY 2021 will be roughly around 2-2.22, which gives a forward P/E ratio of 3.75 to 3.378.

At the end of the day, because of this, I have peace of mind to say I want to buy more if it goes to 7, 6, or 5 before earnings. My thought process is “Oh, a dividend yield of 5.7/6.67/8 percent, with a payout ratio of 27.2% at absolutely MINIMUM, and a payout ratio of 20% or less of -my- calculations? SWEET! Oh, and this share price means they HAVE to do a stock buyback because they save so much fucking money. Fucking WOOHOO!” Furthermore, the company in its first quarter alone is going to earn 1/12th of its market cap in profit roughly, and it is based on its own guidance. So, yes, I want the price to go down. Because I know it’ll go up to its fair value, and my MoM will increase the further down I average.

Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette. But then there are the people like me, deep value investors, who heads straight to the blackjack table, and then counts. And the best part of it is, it is legal. I look at this stock, and I see one of the easiest deep value buys I will ever make. I don’t care about the journey, since I know where the destination is. I **like the stock**.

But do not look at me, look at today at around 5. That is when a dark money buyer bought a huge tranche of shares and the share price went from -.20 to +.41. I checked the order book, and the sell orders from 7.61 to 7.92 were all there, which meant they had not bought from the public. Some guy bought a fuck ton of shares.

My Position: 4,358 Shares averaged at around $8.06, $6 Calls May/21, $7.5 May 21.

**This is not financial advice, I just love the stock.**

**TLDR:** Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette. But then there are the people like me, deep value investors, who heads straight to the blackjack table, and then count. And the best part of it is, it is legal. I look at this stock, and I see one of the easiest deep value buys I will ever make. I do not care about the journey, since I know where the destination is. I **like the stock**.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT EDIT: A commenter somewhere else told me that the dividend is only for shareholders of Class A shares and not Class D (SFS Corp which the owners own). I mistakenly assumed that it was for holders of all common stock. Therefore, the actual dividend is only 41.3 Million which means stockholder's equity grows much more vastly than otherwise indicated. With that said if you go to the 10-K on page 49 you can see that every single share of Class D stock can be exchanged for Class A stock. Also the stock based compensation of people can be seen in the SEC filing on the UWMC investor relations site. This means a stock buyback can still be done, but it might not be the slam dunk proposition i had thought and that a much higher dividend than I had thought, or a huge special dividend might be something that is more likely to happen as opposed to a buyback.",['NDAQ']
mpqxbf,guchd47,wallstreetbets,comment,1618297429,"I'm gonna be honest. I read the first paragraph, saw how long the post was and said nah fuck that. I'm glad DD is being put out on the company though.


I'd like to contribute by voicing my experience having UWMC underwrite my loan. I live in an area where selling your house at the listed price means you fucked up. Since buying my house in july its 'value' (according to redfin, take it with a grain of salt) has gone up 30K in value. To say it's a sellers market is an understatement.


All that being said, I contacted 5 companies about securing my home loan. Of the 5, UWMC was the fastest in replying, had the most competitive rates, and had the best customer service I experienced. 


What do I mean by faster replying? I heard back from Todd later that same day about my loan. Once my side of paperwork was submitted, it took... 2 days? Max? To get a pre-qualification that allowed me to make an offer. To put in perspective, I didnt hear back from the slowest until i closed (offer submitted Friday, reviewed monday, called tuesday saying it was mine if I wanted it).


What do I mean by beat rates? Better than the worst by over a whole percent.


What do I mean by best customer service? I emailed todd late saturday about some random question I had, fully expecting a response no earlier than Monday. This motherfucker hits me up with a response at 11pm that night.


Having said all this, I currently own no UWMC and do not plan on buying any just yet. Im full ape and 100% in GME. That being said, UWMC Is REAL fucking high on my GME tendie reinvestment plan.



I just felt like adding my personal experience with the company may give some perspective for someone.",

mq4moq,,wallstreetbets,post,1618327826,"DKNG vs. PLTR - Why I like them bothI am going to make this DD brief. DKNG and PLTR are considered two leaders in their categories. I hold positions in both but I like DKNG better because I think it will continue to grow as the TAM grows. Millenials are going to push this stock higher over the next decade.

What I love about DKNG:

* Insane Growth, Extremely healthy Gross Margins
* TAM is growing faster than ever- expected to increase to 45B in a few years
* Healthy cash balance
* Price to sales is decreasing drastically as a result of huge top line growth
* tons of opportunities for expansion
* Forward facing consumer company, with more than 30 states that could become available to DKNG. 
* Cathy loves it
* Guidance was increased to 5-7B from 3-5B

What I love about PLTR

* Insane gross margins of near 80%
* Moaty business with lots of contracts related to covid and the defense industry
* Tons of opportunities for expansion
* Potential opportunity for mammoth contracts that come out of nowhere.
* Cathy Loves it

What I don't like about PLTR

* PLTR leadership is known to be conservative- Biden is in the white house so maybe more controversy.
* Their Price to sales isn't decreasing as fast as DKNG
* Guidance was so so.

What I don't love about DKNG

* Not profitable yet but expected to be soon.
* I don't like the competition from fan duel as well as PENN
* Economy opening is bullish for sports gambling but bearish for online gambling
* Heavily regulated industry but showing approvals in multiple states

mq7l0x,,wallstreetbets,post,1618336251,"STRA - Stategic Education Inc. Due DiligenceI am writing a brief due diligence with my limited skills and I'm interested to see what others think about this stock. After looking at the stock, I think it's a quite good value that is probably close to its floor (undervalued).

STRA - Strategic Education Inc.

Strategic Education, Inc., formerly Strayer Education, Inc., is an education services holding company. The Company provides post-secondary education and other academic programs, through its subsidiaries, Strayer University (the University), New York Code and Design Academy (NYCDA) and Capella Education Company (Capella). As of December 31, 2016, the University offered undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business administration, accounting, information technology, education, nursing, public administration and criminal justice at 74 physical campuses located in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions of the United States, and online. The University also offers an executive Master of Business Administration (MBA) online through its Jack Welch Management Institute. NYCDA provides non-degree courses in Web and application software development, primarily at its campus in New York City. Capella provides post-secondary education and job-skills programs.

\*Dividends have increased 3 years in a row, this year dividends are on track to remain at $2.4 per share per year yet the price of the stock is half of what it was last year.

\*The company made money last year during a challenging environment. The company's assets exceed their liabilities and they are solvent.

\*The P/E ratio is a reasonable 22.46.

So basically what I'm seeing is a company still making profit, still paying the same dividend, sales are expected to grow, and in a fine financial position. I don't see how this stock keeps going down below half of it's peak pre covid. This is one of the few that hasn't seemed to have bounced back like the other stocks have yet. The degrees and education they provide seem valuable to the market place as well.

My own thoughts currently - I don't think the risk of going a lot lower is very high, I think the floor is quite sound here. I think this stock could double in a year or two. The financials look fine to me still, their earnings are about 1/20th of the price and they pay out a substantial amount in dividend. The earning projection for 21 is slightly lower than what they had in 19 and 20 but the slope is positive and I believe the blip during a pandemic is probably fine. The sales have been increasing every year. This appears to be a nice value to me. Is this stock a good value right now? The price is still the same price I bought at, I was a bit excited about this stock so I did want to promote it for others in this sub as well as hear others' thoughts on it.

It’s a solid company, 2021 is going to big catalyst due to C19 vaccine, low P/E. Upside potential is huge

Pfizer plans to produce 1B vaccines in 2021.  cost is roughly $10/vaccine. If they can make this happen it’ll be 500M doses. Requires 2 doses. That could mean upwards of +10B in additional revenue including sales & all the govt funding. 

Pfizer getting approval for higher storage temp. This will ease burden on cold supply chain, improve supply and longer life. 

Pfizer is also working on supply chain improvements, moving things in-house to speed up production and control. 

Supply & Production only gets better with time.

CVEI would like to dig into a Canadian oil company called Cenovus energy, hear me out before bashing. I'm all for green energy but we're here to make money and I'm sharing my thoughts, looking for input as well. 

Cenovus announced the acquisition of Husky Energy in late October 2020, to create the third largest Canadian oil and natural gas producer. 
The transaction should be highly accretive and lead to substantial synergies, increased scale, more stable cash generation and reduced group leverage. 

Higher oil prices will allow Cenovus to reach its debt reduction target of $10-billion by year-end, removing the need to sell assets, but Mr. Pourbaix (CEO) said the company is continuing to sort its operations into core and non-core buckets.


#Standout points

* Price to book value is 0.7

* Breakeven at $36US WTI

* Annual synergies $1.2billion

* Cenovus will now have the biggest refining capacity in Canada, second biggest upgrader. 

* Oil production will be almost on par with Suncor. Going from around 450,000 BOE/d to over 750,000 BOE/d

* Cenovus is looking at $4billion USD in free funds flow. Source: http://imgur.com/a/uvY108p

* Cenovus has mentioned share buybacks and dividend increase.

#Saudi Arabia 

A finance ministry spokesman said the kingdom and OPEC+ have immediate and longer term views on maintaining stable oil prices ""for the benefit of all concerned"", and will continue to respond to global events and supply and demand issues in line with this objective.

Ratings agency Fitch expects a fiscal deficit of about $40 billion this year, assuming an average oil price of $59 a barrel, average oil production of 8.7 million barrels a day, and total spending of 1 trillion riyals.

The government would need prices of $76 per barrel to have a balanced budget this year, but under the current dividend policy, and as production recovers, the breakeven price could come down to around $60 a barrel, said Krisjanis Krustins, director in Fitch's sovereign team.

#Russia 

Putin a few years ago said a price of $60-$65 a barrel suited Moscow. Recently Russia would support broadly stable oil output by OPEC+ group of leading global oil producers in May

* We’re piloting methanol fuel cells at our conventional oil and gas operations to identify an efficient and reliable energy source to supplement solar power.  But what is a methanol fuel cell?

* A fuel cell works like a battery as an energy conversion device that turns hydrocarbons like methanol into electricity,” explains Ray Lambert, Emissions Management Engineer, Environmental Solutions & Systems at Cenovus Energy. “And the methanol fuel cells are being trialed as backup power for devices at several of our sites.”

Source: https://www.cenovus.com/news/our-stories/no-sunlight-no-problem-how-methanol-fuel-cells-can-help-us-reduce-our-emissions.html

* Cenovus's long-term ambition is to reach net zero emissions by 2050. This will require ongoing focus on technology solutions beyond those that are commercial and economic today. We continue to identify opportunities to participate in longer-term solutions to address emissions from our operations and beyond. This includes extensive collaboration efforts with our peers, academics, other industries and entrepreneurs from around the world.

* Between 2004 and 2019, Cenovus reduced the CO2 emissions intensity of its oil sands operations by about 30 percent.

* NOx emissions at our Christina Lake oil sands facility are about 50 percent below the regulatory threshold of 400 tonnes per year.

mpwvhc,,wallstreetbets,post,1618296498,"Why I think $VIAC is a buy right now*This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I have never worked in finance in any capacity.*

Viacom CBS is one of the biggest mass media conglomerates in the world. It was formed after the merger of CBS and Viacom in 2019. It owns Paramount pictures, manages over 170 networks, such as Nickelodeon and Comedy Central and has begun a move towards online streaming with youtube channels and its Paramount Plus streaming service.

**Why $VIAC's price is so low right now**

In the past month, $VIAC has crashed over 56.33%. For those who aren’t aware, this decrease was caused by 3 factors :

* Viacom announced a 3 billion dollar stock sale causing a 23.2% crash
* Investors downgraded Viacom’s stock
* Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its position in Viacom CBS, causing an additional 27% plunge in the price of VIAC [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management#cite_note-jcwsj-6)

**Why do I think $VIAC is a buy**

There are several reasons why Viacom CBS is a buy. Firstly, its heavily discounted because of the sudden crash and so may have a short term momentum reversal to restore its price to normal:

* The P/E ratio of $VIAC is at a very low 10.66
* According to Yahoo Finance, the average analyst price target for $VIAC is $54.65, while the price of $VIAC is currently only $39.77

Secondly, the company has been performing solidly on fundamentals:

* Viacom CBS’s earnings have experienced steady growth in 2020, from $516M in Q1 to $810M in Q4
* Viacom CBS increased operating cash flow from $1171M in 2019 to $2215M in 2020
* In a digital era, Viacom CBS has also been moving in the right direction with its online streaming services, it gained 30M new global streaming subscribers last year and Global streaming & digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888M
* In Q4, CBS was the most-watched network in Daytime and Late Night and claimed the quarter’s top drama, news magazine and 4 of the top 5 comedies, as well as the top new comedy series

On the negative side, it must be noted that $VIAC's short interest is 18%, meaning it would take shorts 2 days to cover (source: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=viac&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=viac&submit=Short+Quote)), so there is a fair amount of negative sentiment. 

TLDR :

$VIAC is a strong company at a crazy discount. $VIAC TO THE MOON",['VIAC']

Archegos used 5x leverage that propped VIAC. He went from 1 bank, bought a bunch of bananas that caused the price of bananas to go up. Hwang being a brilliant kind of ape, went to a second bank and did the same thing. He repeated the process 5x on half a dozen banana brands driving up the share price of all his bananas. Hwang did this through a shady practice with banks call TRS (total return swaps). TRS is kinda like the same kind of dirty bank deals that brought down the mortgage system in '08.

The important takeaway to keep in mind is the TRS. Hwang didn't technically own the bananas, the banks did and their dumb asses are sweeping it under the rug, waiting for another Archegos.",['VIAC']

Also they are moving towards streaming services as they should be.

It will probably get driven a bit lower first bc of the reasons mentioned, but I agree it is a buy.",['VIAC']

&nbsp;

To kick off earnings season, we’ve got seven of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. This week provides us with an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move extremely predictably post-earnings, allowing us to make some easy dough.

&nbsp;

---

#Implied Volatility during Earnings Season

Because it is earnings week, the IV on our options will be jacked to the tits as the option needs to price in any given “move” that the underlying may make. In practice, this is *extremely* hard to do right, and often results in an *extremely* inflated guess, as it’s calculated in relation to a whole fuckload of ever changing variables. The implied move that an option prices in around earnings is very rarely met, so if you buy options, understand that they will expire OTM 95% of the time. The other 5% of the time, you’ll get IV crushed so badly that you might not even walk away with any profits, even though you called the correct move.

&nbsp;

Armed with this knowledge, we know that if we wish to “gamble” on earnings, we’re best off selling the options. We may not hit any insane 10 baggers, but we’re extremely likely to pocket some free money, even if the underlying doesn’t move as planned.

&nbsp;

---

# The Play

If it wasn’t made obvious from the rundown above, we’re going to be selling options going into the financial sectors’ earnings season. The easiest and most consistent way to win during earnings season is to sell short strangles, and iron condors. With these strategies, we don’t need to be right about the directional movement of the underlying whatsoever. We simply collect a fat upfront premium, and then buy back the spread the day after earnings have been reported at an insane discount (often 60-80% cheaper) because of IV crush.

&nbsp;

Even though the options always price in a crazy move, historically, the stocks within the financial sector tend to *move very little* after they report earnings. This makes this play extremely safe in my eyes, as there is very little risk we get blown out by an unexpected move. Furthermore, the companies in this sector are very old, consistent, and established. It’s extremely unlikely that they would release something totally unexpected within their reports which would warrant a wild move, though the options still price it in anyways.

&nbsp;

To aid us in our play, [**I’ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of the Post-Earnings Moves that every single reporting bank has made for the past 20 earnings cycles**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16b_OLj9fDEyKlanro3qSeeSeNaD9XxMeyPv4NkclMN4/edit?usp=sharing). Using the spreadsheet, we can determine which options to sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for every single bank. For example, we can see that historically, on average, $JPM moves less than 2% following an earnings report, and that the largest move that $JPM has ever made post earnings was 5% to the upside. As a result, we know what if we sell a call credit spread that’s 5% out of the money, we can be almost certain that it will expire out of the money by the end of the week, allowing us to pocket most, if not all of the premium. For those traders who can stomach more risk, we can look to sell short straddles on $JPM that are 2% out of the money on both ends to pocket an even larger premium, while still having a favourable risk profile.

&nbsp;

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;


- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as *these banks report across different days*. Since 4 of the 7 banks report on Wednesday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the four banks are green after reporting earnings on Wednesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.


- As touched upon above, **$JPM moves very little after earnings**. You can likely get away with placing extremely tight strangles as a result, since you run little risk of getting blown out on either side.

- **$WFC is allergic to delivering a good earnings report**. After its past 22 reports, Wells Fargo has tanked **18** times (82%). If you’re going to play this ticker, you can easily get away with selling credit spreads ATM or slightly OTM, as this shit is incapable of going up.

- Similar to Wells Fargo, **Citigroup either makes a small move to the upside, or gets blown out to the downside**. Slightly OTM credit spreads are the way to go if you’re playing this one.

- **If you’re playing Blackrock, make sure your strikes are far OTM**. It’s not uncommon for them to put up a 4% move post earnings. The moves are big, but the premiums are juicy. IF you plan on playing, I would look to play an iron condor, so I can have the protection if needed.

- In general, if you’re playing any sort of a strangle, you can safely sell any of the strikes which are outside of the highlighted maximum moves within the spreadsheet.

&nbsp;

If you use the spreadsheet to choose the safest strikes, these plays are incredibly hard to fuck up. You simply sell a short strangle / iron condor / credit spread, wait for earnings to be released, and then buy it back for significantly cheaper than what you sold it for.

&nbsp;

#The Gamblers Crutch

Selling options is boring, because you know exactly how much money you’re gonna make beforehand. If you wish to spice this play up with a little bit of *uncertainty*, consider picking up some **$XLF** Calls or Puts. XLF is made up of every single bank which is reporting earnings this week, yet since it’s an ETF, it has an extremely low IV, regardless of the fact that it’s gonna make some fucking *HUGE* moves since **all of it’s holding report earnings this week**. The implied volatility of each bank who reports earnings this week is around 50 or 60, yet XLF, who is made up of each reporting bank, has an IV of around 20%. 

&nbsp;

According to historical data, around earnings season, most banks move in tandem with one another ; they’re often all red, or all green. We can use this to our advantage, since half of the banks report earnings on Wednesday. Once a trend is established, we can grab some 2DTE XLF calls and bag some free gains once the rest of the banks report earnings the day after. You can also just be a degenerate and try calling a direction before the banks report all together, though this would literally be a crapshoot. Regardless, the rewards you can make by playing XLF this week are spectacular, and those who don’t want to sell the options should definitely capitalize on this opportunity.

&nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

Seven of America's largest banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. It should be impossible to lose any of the trades you make on them, unless JPM announces that they’ve invented a time machine or someshit. For those who want to slam a 10 bagger instead of securing guaranteed premium gains, consider buying calls / puts on $XLF. All of it’s holding report earnings this week, yet it still only has an IV of 20%. Since banks tend to move in tandem with one another, it’s either gonna pop or plunge.

One word: bullish

We had a slight delay due to Europe covid, but the play is still strong.

Why?

US production is about to drop an additional 1-2mbd by the end of the year due to legacy declines in the various shale patches.

I also anticipate another 2-3mbd of declines from conventional wells in the opec and non opec nations due to underinvestment/damage from the shut ins.

The market believes that there is roughly 100mbd of production waiting for when the economy rips later this year. The problem is that there is realistically somewhere between 94-96mbd actually available.

The market will figure this out sometime this summer and shit will get real.

On top of that, BP, XOM, RDS, etc have all hinted at massive earnings incoming. 

Earnings are possibly the signal for them to rip higher.

I have no money at risk. Pricing inefficiencies and differences allow me to make a fixed profit, no matter the direction of the stock. UVXY is a perfect choice for box spreads, as it has a predictable chart and steadily goes up as time passes.

I plan on buying 2 - 4k contracts that all expire 1 year from now.

It is 100% risk-free. I have no money at risk.

More info and proof will come soon. Feel free to leave your thoughts on this trade with me.
