News broke maybe 30 mins ago. MSFT shot up 1% on that news, up more than 2% on the day.

>""Microsoft will deliver to the U.S. Army over 120,000 devices based on its HoloLens augmented-reality headset.""  
>  
>""The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures.""  
>  
>""A group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. “We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,” the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract.""

mh71l1,,stocks,post,1617200130,"PSA: Blackberry / $BB is up 100% for the year, 30% YTD, Nokia ($NOK) is up 30% for the year. What the heck are people complaining about?Why are people always complaining how Blackberry is misunderstood? Why do they think their ""misunderstood"" technology isn't valued in? There's a chip shortage and $BB needs chips to make money. As far as I know, they don't actually manufacturer the chips. And other companies will get priority in chips before Blackberry.

Even with the recent dips, it's already up 100% for the year. That's pretty good for a stock that always misses out on revenue. And since they need chips to be successful during a chip shortage, I think this stock stays flat or even dips further for the year. But to finish 50-100% for the year is still a nice year. And I think their software is already valued in.

Even $NOK isn't too bad unless you bought at the year high.

mhhxq0,,stocks,post,1617231453,"BB BlackBerry earnings/call were actually bullish ✅I see **many** paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG BB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4. *(for reference $8.50 -8.7% 31st March 2021)*

Can we please dig a little bit deeper? Thank you.

*During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to **mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.** The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.*

**Boom** pure and simple explanation for why the revenue missed. It’s not on weaker demand. It’s only because they are about to sell their side business and consequently they had to significantly cut that stream of revenue. Which also means that negotiations are advanced.

**What will happen then they sell?** they will receive a big fat cheque (don’t quote me on this but I imagine north of $500m if not a billion+ ; pure speculation) + according to the CEO they will collect royalties for 7 years. And they get to focus on their core businesses: cybersecurity, EV software, internet of things.

Is this good strategy-wise? Absolutely. Focus on your top projects with higher gross margins. Let go of the past and embrace the future. 

**any analyst reaction? Yes indeed Canaccord upgraded the stock to Hold** from Sell this morning.

**Canaccord sees 'building blocks coming together'**

*Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends”. The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.*

*Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.*

*The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""*

So even boomers traditionally late to the technology party are starting to see the whole BlackBerry’s strategy aligning. But these guys stay on the sideline because they don’t like early tendies. They lack the vision to say it’s an actual Buy especially at these levels. They will probably wait that a bigger broker moves first. And they will. 

**a quick look at the numbers** BlackBerry has a $5bn market cap with $1bn+ yearly revenue and $800m in cash. I imagine investors can put 2 and 2 together. What do you think will happen to their balance sheet when they cash in the incoming sale of their portfolio. Way more cash to execute their plans and potential M&A if needed and no need for new shares issuance as confirmed by the CEO (no dilution in sight ; enough money in the bank). We could be in the coming weeks in a situation where BB has in cash the equivalent of 25%+ of their market cap...

**how about their core strategy?** 
*QNX now has design wins with 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs and remains on course to return to a normal revenue run rate by mid-fiscal 2022. BlackBerry IVY also made encouraging progress, with positive engagement from a number of leading automakers and the launch of our BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund.* 

In just one quarter they added 4 more EV OEMs with QNX (from 19 to 23 now). 

They are well positioned to be involved in autonomous driving: *BlackBerry expands its partnership with Baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology.* and *BlackBerry QNX Black Channel Communications to be used in Motional's driverless platform.* These are weeks-old news but it’s funny how it seems to go under the radar when it comes to price the company. Correct me if I’m wrong but Baidu could be the first and/or major player in autonomous driving in Asia. 

QNX is still in SpaceX rockets. And I start to hear rumors that Tesla could consider using it too (very speculative but at least you’ve heard it).

And for the people who have ended up here randomly BlackBerry [IVY](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) is a joint venture with Amazon AWS for intelligent vehicle data platform. When the IVY deal was released BB shot past $9. AWS boss/founder at the time is now Amazon CEO. 

So yea the revenue has missed by a few millions for an one-off reason. Have the fundamentals changed? Actually yes they have improved as they are well on track to pursue their strategic goals.

The question you should ask yourself is whether you are pricing BlackBerry based on their FY2020 or on what they are about to become? (hint: strong presence in EV software worldwide + autonomous driving + efficient cybersecurity product)

Before you ask me in the comments: shares are safe, calls good luck timing them although I probably bought more June calls together with some shares (don’t do this at home ; go cash gang ; save your money). Disclosure: long shares and June 20C.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

**TLDR** why are you selling BB? if that’s because the revenue has slightly missed because they are selling a big chunk of their unneeded business for big money then you should ask yourself why you are in this ship in the first place. Even boomers analysts upgraded the stock this morning: they are starting to see BlackBerry business model happening.

Bonus: when will the sale happen? 🔮 crystal ball said before the next ER so in a few weeks (totally random and speculative).","['BLL', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']"

mgzbrc,,stocks,post,1617169909,"Quick Reminder: Having a portfolio consisting of different tech stocks does not mean you have a ‘Diversified Portfolio’To whom it may concern: (I’m aware most of you know how to properly diversify). 

I see some investors on here being invested in multiple tech equities, APPL, TSLA, AMZN, SONO etc. and talking about how well diversified their portfolio is. 

Just a quick reminder than having a diversified portfolio means that you have equities with ‘negative correlation’, and/or no correlation in addition to being diversified into different asset classes (equities, fixed-income, cash)(ex. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s). 

Or into different market caps, levels of risk, growth/value, sector/industries as well as domestic and foreign investments. 

Any political, economical, or social catalysts that can affect the tech industry will most likely affect all your investors at the same time, in the same way, therefore just a quick reminder that having a portfolio consisting of only techs does not reduce the overall risk in your portfolio, and if anything, increases it, as such, you are not ‘Diversified’.

This doesn’t just apply to techs, it applies to any portfolio that only has positively correlated assets within the same sector/industries.

Edit: This post is about the concept of having a diversified portfolio, not rate of return or investment objectives, capital limitations etc. Pls keep comments and topics relative to diversification.","['TSLA', 'AMZN']"

mhkybv,,stocks,post,1617241735,"$MP Materials - A rare, rare earth company bringing sustainable production back to the USThought I'd take a chance to provide some information on a stock that I have liked for a while, MP Materials.  Right now it is sitting at a low point for a while and I think the time is ripe for the pickens.  Why do I think this right now?

Well MP sits at a mining site in the middle of the desert out near the Cali-Nevada border.  [They sit just south of Las Vegas](https://www.google.com/maps/search/mp+materials/@35.4652108,-115.5387785,17915m/data=!3m1!1e3) right next to a highway for easy transport of the extracted and purified materials as they both mine and refine the ore. 

Well let's start with what they do: rare earth materials mining.  Not the sexiest job on the planet, but it is necessary for all things tech.  Rare earths are a key component of clean energy, IT, defense, industrial applications, and neat little magnets.  Right now, the vast majority of rare earths are produced by China at 80%, leaving a huge vulnerability in a high sought after market.  The market isn't going away but China could pull it's supply.

The US-China relations are at a pretty fragile point.  [NASA has even called Taiwan a country](https://www.newsweek.com/unforgivable-china-furious-nasa-calling-taiwan-country-1580084) which is a hugely sensitive issue.   The current administration seeks to counter Chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been [reviewing the reliance on China for rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-biden-order/biden-to-order-review-of-u-s-reliance-on-overseas-supply-chains-for-semiconductors-rare-earths-cnbc-idUSKBN2AI2HJ).  

[The price of rare earths is rising, and it caused a jump in the stock price earlier in the month](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mp-materials-quarterly-profit-jumps-on-rising-rare-earths-prices-2021-03-18) - the soaring need for electric vehicles should continue to push it further.  Though the stock price jumped, it did plummet on news that they were [issuing some additional shares, about 10%, to fund new green energy initiatives.](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2021/MP-Materials-Announces-Pricing-of-600-Million-Green-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx).  With a larger focus on environmentally friendly projects, it makes $MP a prime target for eco-conscious investors.  

In my opinion, the price dive spooked a large amount of investors sending it way below it's fair value.  10% dilution rocked it to a 30% price dive that it is coming back from strongly now.  Even with the dilution included, the price should pop back up another 20% or so as the market in growth stock picks back up.  $MP doubled the analyst estimates for EPS in Q4 last year and don't look to be slowing down.  [Looking ahead, the forward looking EPS estimates put it at close to $2 for a 15 p/e ratio](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates) with $0.48 EPS in the 4th quarter of 2021.  MP materials hasn't been around long, taking over the site from failed Molycorp, but appear to be hitting it at a good time.  Now not only are they expected to be profitable quickly, but also have the new $584m in cash to ramp up and clean up their operation to ensure a sustainable and competitive supplier of rare earths.

[If you look at their earnings presentation](https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf), the story keeps getting better though.  They had 100% YoY revenue growth and are still reducing the cost of production.  Modest for Q4 YoY, but 25% for the entire year.  

I am long MP, with a few hundred shares and a 4/16 $45c.  I like the potential of such a young company that is already pulling a profit in a growing market with a sustainable business model.  Somehow this is a growth stock that has a profitable business model, seems like a safe bet to me - though this isn't financial advise, this is just my own opinion.",['NDAQ']

In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, lead analyst David Vogt says that a ""more stable long-term iPhone demand backdrop with better [average selling prices]"" and Apple's ""likely entry into the auto market"" are driving the UBS revision on AAPL shares. 

The analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn't believe there's a ""supercycle"" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the ""stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem.""

You need to identify an advantage if you want to consistently beat the market and I’m not sure what advantage a retail day trader could possibly have over other markets participants. For a start algos have a huge speed advantage and professional traders have a significant data advantage, where as you’re probably trading on your phone from an app that sells your order flow to Wall Street.

As a retail trader you might be able to identify a stock that’s undervalued with some attractive catalysts to go higher over the course of several months or years, but what that stock does on any given day will depend more on economic news or if some large holder decides to sell their position. As a retail trader you won’t get a heads up on events like these, but professionals on Wall Street are often aware before anyone else because that’s their job.

On the rare occasion that I day trade now it’s by accident. For example, occasionally I’ll be in a position that intend to hold for several months but if on the same day it just happens to be up 10-20% I’ll typically take profit. I think day trades like this are okay, but if you’re actively trying to day trade  research (and my own experience) would suggest you’re extremely likely to under perform.",

However, **ADP private payrolls** growth of 517K only a bit better than 500K consensus. March **Chicago PMI** highest since Jul-18. February **pending home sales** missed on tight inventory. **China manufacturing and services PMIs** **surprised to the upside**, hitting three- and four-month highs, respectively. **Eurozone headline and core inflation came in softer**.

Multiple reports noted **Biden to let Trump's H1-B visa ban expire**.
   * **WBA** beat and raised with Street positive on execution given COVID headwinds. **LULU** beat with Street positive on digital sales strength and momentum into Q1 but some disappointment 2021 EPS guidance light on Mirror dilution. **CHWY** a standout after it beat and guided above with takeaways positive on rebound in new customer adds and opportunities in healthcare. **KR** reconfirmed FY21 comps guidance but bar high. **CLF** guided 2021 EBITDA above the Street with takeaways noting the company's leverage to stronger domestic steel prices. **PVH** results mixed with revenue below but EBIT ahead while FY guide below on softer NA outlook but not really a surprise. **BB** revenue missed.

Unemployment rate expected to fall 0.2 pp to 6.0%, while average hourly earnings expected to hold at +0.2% (and down to 4.5% y/y from February's +5.3%). Some sell-side previews noted upside risk to payrolls could be driven by strong reopening momentum, with some real-time data showing fastest activity growth since last summer.

   * **Still no clarity on what exactly is coming in Phase 2 of Biden plan:**
      * While programs announced today in Biden's ""American Jobs Plan"" to focus on physical infrastructure, White House also preparing another round of proposals which could bring the total pricetag for this effort near $4T. Administration officials speaking about this next phase only in broadest strokes, though likely to include family-centered elements such as improved health coverage, expanded child tax benefit, and paid family/medical leave. Structure and timing of this follow-on effort remain unclear, though idea of pairing physical infrastructure with other traditional Democratic priorities plays into notion Biden hopes to engineer a broad overhaul of the economy in the mold of FDR's New Deal or LBJ's Great Society. No rollout date for phase 2 has been announced but commentators see a speech coming sometime before the White House's climate summit on 22-23 April.

**The Basics**
---

Skillz is an online platform for creating mobile game tournaments with monetary prize pools. They do not make any games themselves, rather, they host the platform to create tournaments with monetary prize pools. Their actual *product* is an SDK for developers to use ([source](https://www.skillz.com/how-it-works/)). Side note: an SDK is pre-written code that someone can use within their code base to implement certain functionality, in this case, it is for the tournament capabilities.

Current Share Price: $19

Current Valuation: $7.4B

**What is so exciting about SKLZ?**
---

The North American mobile gaming market is $21.9B with a lot of expansion expected ([source](https://www.statista.com/topics/1906/mobile-gaming/)). The global gaming market is even juicier at $160B+ ([source](https://www.dotcominfoway.com/blog/infographic-mobile-game-market-trends-2020/)). Not only this, but gambling is on the rise and expected to be an emerging industry at $3.2B for the USA ([source](https://g-mnews.com/sports-betting-and-igaming-outlook-in-the-united-states/)). With such juicy markets, you can tell why people are excited about the prospects of a new entrant poised to take advantage of these trends. There's only one problem...

**SKLZ is neither a game company nor a gambling company**
---

In a lot of DD that I see, they are comparing SKLZ valuation with other gaming companies or gambling companies. However, fundamentally, SKLZ does not match any of these.

> SKLZ is not a gaming company

SKLZ does not make any games itself. It is reliant on 3rd party independent developers to create games and monetize them. I'm not saying this is a bad thing. SKLZ has consistently gotten popular games onto its platform. My only point here is that **while SKLZ can ride overall mobile gaming trends, you cannot compare SKLZ to other mobile gaming companies**. It's comparing apples to oranges. Thus, any DD that relies on this as a method of valuation is fundamentally flawed.

> SKLZ is not a gambling company

SKLZ, as its name suggests, is skill-based matchmaking for money. The majority of people *lose* in this model. While its games may incorporate chance within them, the very purpose of SKLZ's product is that people **compete** for money. This is as much gambling as a League of Legends tournament is. Once more, this isn't a negative, I just want to say that any DD ([like this one](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/22/3-gambling-stocks-poised-for-a-bull-run/)) relying on this comparison or expecting SKLZ to ride on the iGaming tailwinds is invalid.

Even SKLZ makes comparisons like [this](https://imgur.com/WHnWUvh). They should know better.

**So how do we correctly value SKLZ then?**
---

SKLZ attempts to capture a portion of the mobile gaming market. Now what is this portion?

- Age range: 18-40 (https://imgur.com/iPARna5)

- Simple, non-AAA games ([see list of current games as source](https://games.skillz.com/))

- Competitive multiplayer games

All these, I consider bad for the company. 

So, let's dig deeper into how I came up with this list and what it means for SKLZ. For the purposes of this DD, I'll focus primarily on USA where SKLZ has its most business. Obviously, they want to expand internationally, but there are issues with that which I'll later discuss.

**Age**

The actual target market SKLZ wants to be in is gamers age 45+ ([source](https://www.mmaglobal.com/research/myth-busting-mobile-gaming-demographics)).

The findings of this study reveal a direct correlation between the amounts of money spent on virtual goods within social games and gamer age - the older the gamer, the more they spend. Based on the study, 70% of all the gamers over 45 years bought virtual goods.

Furthermore, in terms of population, gamers 18-45 years old have about the same number of people as gamers 45+ ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/)). This means that the lion's share of the opportunity of SKLZ is locked away in a target audience that they have failed to reach. Obviously, they can try to reach this audience, but this brings me back to one of my earlier points: SKLZ is not a mobile gaming company. They don't get to decide who uses their platform or not. It's up to other game devs to do so and by the prevalence of their current demographic, we already know who SKLZ game devs caters towards.

Even as we talk about the growth of mobile gaming, most of that growth is captured in the 45+ age range as well as the under 18 age range ([source](https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-people-over-age-of-45-started-mobile-gaming-2020-than-any-other-age-group)).

My overall point is this: while SKLZ will certainly benefit from mobile gaming trends, it will not benefit as much as investors think it will. Its growth is overstated from a fundamental misunderstanding of the actual mobile gaming market.

**Simple, non-AAA games**

My first introduction to SKLZ was when they announced their NFL partnership. One thing that a lot of people thought was that some awesome football-based, Madden clone would use the SKLZ platform ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcn02f/your_thoughts_on_sklz/)). People think that SKLZ is going to go into the esports market which is plain wrong. SKLZ, on their own website, says that they built their platform for competitors left out of the esports market!

Furthermore, money-based tournaments is not a new idea. While SKLZ has a good implementation of this idea, AAA developers have this figured out already. Just look at League of Legends, Call of Duty, or any other current esport out there. They all have online tournaments with monetary prizes. No AAA developers would use SKLZ when SKLZ takes 18% of the gross.

For a small-time developer with a prize pool of $100, that's only $18. But imagine a prize pool of $2.34M ([League of Legend's 2020 prize pool](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749024/league-of-legends-championships-prize-pool/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20LoL%20World,2.23%20million%20a%20year%20earlier.)). Why would they spend $300k+ on licensing when they can build a similar product for $500k and use it next year as well? Obviously, this isn't a perfect example, but my point still stands: **AAA developers can imitate SKLZ's platform cheaply**.

**Competitive multiplayer games**

Obviously, SKLZ can't exist in single player games. Nor can it exists in non-competitive games. If we look at the popularity of mobile games by type, you'll see...

https://imgur.com/AP4sKzA

That player vs player games is among the least played. Not to say its not played, but it's certainly towards the bottom. Not only that, if you look at the most popular mobile games currently available, you'll notice some big name competitive multiplayer mobile games on that list ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-played_mobile_games_by_player_count)). What this means is that the 15% available market is already being eaten up by AAA games which we already know SKLZ has no access to.

In terms of the popularity of their games, it really worries me that for the past 5 years, they have coasted off the same 5 games. From their own investor presentation, they say this though they claim its a positive:

https://imgur.com/byehp8r

Notice the lack of new additions to their popular games. They seemed to have found a few breakout games early and haven't been able to move past them. Those games are losing popularity over the years and SKLZ will need new ones to bolster their business. They've had 5 years to do it, they haven't.

**In conclusion...**
---

Based upon the points above, I believe investors expect unrealistic growth from SKLZ and thus, its current stock is overvalued. All analysis I've seen so far have been flawed from a fundamental misunderstanding of SKLZ as a company and the sole product they offer.

So, what do I think is a fair valuation?

Well, let's look at the market they serve. Gaming in the US is worth $21.9B currently. Their target age range of 18-40 captures ~50% of that, though this age range spends less money so we'll bring that number down to 40% (personal estimate). The type of game they need is 15% of this market of which 75% (personal estimate) is captured by AAA games which they don't have access to. Thus if we do the math, their current business model can capture:

**$21.9B * 40% * 15% * 25% = 0.3285B or $328.5M.**

Their current revenue is $230M (already close to capturing the max value) with promises to double next year and again the year after. The only way this is possible is if they expand their age range to gamers 45+, but remember, SKLZ does not control this at all. It's up to the game devs that use their platform. SKLZ has no say in it and current market trends is still gearing games towards gamers age 18-40.

I see no way that SKLZ can maintain their current promises to investors.

---

But /u/jraywang, you say, SKLZ's revenues have already doubled this year and their financials are great!

Yes. I agree that they have a solid balance sheet. Their cash is at ~$260M and their liabilities are at $50M. This is a great assets to liabilities ratio. Also, it is true that their revenues grew by 92% in 2020 which indicates that they might be able to do it again for 2021. Part of this can be attributed to COVID, but part of it, we must give SKLZ credit.

Though, one thing that worries me, you can find in their income statement: **their marketing expense** ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKLZ/financials/)).

From 2019 to 2020, their marketing expense went up by **250%** (from ~$100M to ~$250M which is more than their total revenue)

As a result, they increased revenues by **92%** (from $120M to $230M).

Not only did they have COVID tailwinds, but they had insane marketing, yet were unable to recoup their expense through revenue expansion. This is fine **if** they can get their users to stick to their platforms. 

**One HUGE call out I want to make: their user is not the gamer. Their user is the game developer.**

mhmhj0,,stocks,post,1617247222,"FUBO has big upside from recent selloffFrom it's peak of roughly $62 a few short months ago, to it's current $22 it has been a wild ride. Fubo is an incredible streaming service especially when it comes to sports. As a user and subscriber myself what they offer for $65 a month well worth it in addition to the $18 sports package. That to me is personally enough to ever need at a much cheaper price that cable. I'm just some stoner in my 20's what more would I need? Now imagine a shit ton of us starting to cut cable and move towards these streaming services? 

There is a growing market of ""cord cutters"" that is going to be in the millions. If Fubo can grow their marketing and grab a large chunk that will help its revenue grow substantially. Revenue that just topped 100m for it's first quarter ever. It should be noted that FUBO reacted positively to earnings and then the tech fuckery began. 

With their acquisition of Vigtory, a sports betting company, their goal to achieve a single platform tv screen and betting screen is extremely tangible. Imagine the amount of guys in their 20s and 30s who'd sign up for this shit. Not only would they be added subscribers, but they could go from a $65 a month subscriber to a few hundred or a few thousand. This is hopefully going to be implemented in the fall or early winter. 

With the recent rotation out of growth stocks, FUBO will rip back, as many of these stocks have fallen 50-60%, people will quickly rotate into them again. I don't see it being a slow bleed for much longer. With these sharp drops due to the selloff, it's looking attractive with a decent short float of 35%. This could very easily trigger a decent sized squeeze. 

Institutions love FUBO as well. It's riding at 63% institutional ownership at this point despite the beatdown. You would see them have exited their positions by now if this doesn't bounce back hard. 

$80+ EOY book it.

Their main competitor is YouTube TV, but Fubo is in a very good position against them right now. YouTube TV has more than doubled their prices over the past couple years, and still doesn’t have as many channels as Fubo. Fubo makes more money per subscriber than any other live streaming service, and their only going to continue to make more as they focus more on ad revenue (up 174% QoQ) and obviously through their sports betting addition. Bookies make a fuck ton of money, meaning they could potentially run their subscriptions at a loss and keep the price at $65, while getting the Turner channels back.

As the pace of vaccinations increases (roughly 3 million doses distributed per day in the US), it seems market participants have been rotating to stocks poised to benefit from the gradual reopening of the economy. 

Despite signs of economic improvement, market participants are concerned that the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, combined with massive fiscal spending, may cause an unwanted rise in inflation, reinforced by the recent climb in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (1.735% at the time of writing).

No, not heparin like side effects.  Heparin is a blood thinner.  However, in rare cases heparin (and other drugs) can trigger the immune system to attack platelets (the stuff in your blood that clots).

If you bounce into the ER here, yea...  fast blood work to include a blood count, platelets and a DDimer, fast tracked to a CT scan, and a hematology consult if the tests pop.  

Because of the risk of a double whammy, where heparin would also provoke a bigger immune response, heparin is avoided and we’ll go with an anti-Xa pill like: rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.  If it’s looking bad, probably IV immunoglobulin.  Depending on the CT, what clots were where, interventional neurology could be called in to cath your brain.  Like a cardiac cath...  just a smidge trickier.

Currently, we’re having way more people die of covid than the very rare, bad side effect which is treatable.  They’re looking into if it’s a genetic predisposition, a temperature change during shipping,...  all that.  

I’m some ways, this is worse for J&J, lost product, narrow supply chain,...  lost like 15 million doses that are due for delivery... retraining, reevaluating the production pipeline...

  2)We all know Henrik Fisker failed badly in the years 2011-2013 when he tried to take his grand idea of a company into reality. But the very fact that his name is still out there and people still have respect for him shows something about the trust there is out there in him, so when President Biden will unveil the green bill it’s very likely that Fisker will be part of it. 

  3)Even more than that- Joe Biden was the won that put Henrik Fiskers green energy ambitions into the spotlight when he signed deals with him in 2012-2013. So I’m thinking he probably still friends with Biden and will get a significant amount in that Bill. (We all know there is prejudice and undercover stuff involved in these stuff☺️ and it’s worth to mention that Hunter Biden is or was listed as a founder in the company). 

  4)Another strong reason why Fisker is a candidate for strong growth from the green bill is because the stock hasn’t really gone up too much yet unlike lots of it’s peers in that industry.

mgra7y,,stocks,post,1617142053,"Blink Charging ($BLNK) is Scheme to Siphon Money to the Pockets of InsidersBlink Charging Co, headed by CEO Michael D. Farkas, claims to own, operate, and provide electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networks throughout the United States. It currently offers both residential and commercial EV charging equipment and utilizes a real-time cloud-based system to track the current usage and operation of its EV charging stations. Currently, Blink claims to have over 15,000 of these EV charging stations in operation throughout the U.S. And closing today with a share price of $36.98, Blink seems to give investors and analysts alike hope that it has great prospects to become a large firm in the EV charging space. However, as I'll discuss in further detail, everything about this company - its operations, financials, and leadership - are rotten to the core. 

*Data for this post was* [*sourced*](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_BLNK_8-19-2020.pdf?ver=1615557473084) *from the Culper Research Report on Blink Charging Co, published in August of 2020. I have no reason to believe that significant changes have occurred since.*

*I am not an analyst or financial professional nor do I have any positions (or plan to open any) in Blink Charging Co.*

&#x200B;

1. 15,000 charging stations sounds impressive compared to Tesla's 5000; 2,192 does not.

According to Culper Research's inquiries, ""Our on-the-ground visits to 242 stations at 88 locations across the U.S. revealed a plethora of neglected, abused, non-functional, or otherwise missing chargers. Our analysis of the Company’s own data suggests that the average charger is utilized for just 6 to 38 minutes per day (0.39% to 2.65% utilization), while annual charging revenue of a mere $6.37 per member suggests that the average Blink member doesn’t even obtain one single full charge from the Blink network over the course of an entire year."" 

In terms of charging stations, ""As of June 30, 2020, the Company had 15,151 charging stations deployed, of which, 5,385 were Level 2 commercial charging units, 102 were DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 1,193 were residential charging units. Additionally, as of June 30, 2020, the Company had 305 Level 2 commercial charging units on other networks and there were also 8,166 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations.” 

Why's that important? Well, ""Unless Blink expects that all residential charger owners are set to open their garages for complete strangers to steal their electricity, the Company’s claim that “EV drivers can easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging \[stations\]” is an egregious overstatement which we suspect has been designed to mislead investors.""

And of the 5385 charging stations remaining, fewer are listed by the company's own app, ""Our sampling suggests that of the 3,275 chargers listed on the Company’s map, only 67% of these, or 2,192, exist, are functional, and are publicly accessible.""

&#x200B;

2. Blink's earnings compared to compensation expenses shed light on its true purpose.

Culper also found that, ""Since 2014, compensation expense of $44 million is more than double the Company’s $18 million in cumulative revenues, which have remained flat despite the Company’s incessant promotion of supposedly groundbreaking partnerships, international expansions, and new technology under development.""

But for a mid-cap company valued at $1.5 billion, only 88 employees are on LinkedIn. 

But how does tanking the company help executives? Culper states, ""Farkas has now dumped at least 1.8 million shares over the past 2 years while at least 7 executives and board members have left the Company. This mass exodus has culminated with COO James Christodoulou in March 2020. Christodoulou is now suing Farkas and the Company, citing numerous counts of securities fraud. Also in March 2020, the Company’s primary lender and 9.9% shareholder – Justin Keener – was charged by the SEC, which cited toxic convertible lending practices... Thus, Blink has turned to the PPP program, taking a loan which it has already burned through and does not intend to repay."" 

&#x200B;

3. Michael Farkas has done this before.

Below are three separate instances of Farkas' involvement in fraudulent schemes that parallel what's happening with Blink.

""Skyway Communications (formerly SWYC) purported to be “developing a ground to air in-flight aircraft communication network that we anticipate will facilitate homeland security and in-flight entertainment.” However, this was effectively a front. In 2006, an aircraft was seized by the Mexican government holding 5.6 tons of cocaine, reportedly $100 million worth. With Farkas as the company’s largest investor, at one point holding majority ownership, the stock collapsed, and Skyway’s principals were sued by the SEC for the pump-and-dump scheme. Farkas denied knowledge of the scheme, even as Skyway had just 2 employees and shared an office with Farkas’s investment firm, which was a majority owner. 

At GenesisIntermedia, Inc. / Genesis Realty Group, (formerly GENI), Farkas worked with Jeffrey and Darren Glick, Adnan Khashoggi, and Ramy El-Batrawi. The group was sued by the SEC, alleging, in sum, “a scheme to manipulate the stock price of GENI, now-defunct public company, and misappropriated more than $130 million in the process.” This was part of a broader scheme, which also involved Atlas Recreational / Holiday RV Superstores, where Farkas was a majority owner with 59% of the company. As part of this scheme, the SEC also brought charges against MJK Clearing, Inc., a.k.a. “Stockwalk”, which lost more than $200 million and was forced into liquidation. 

With respect to Red Sea Management Limited, Farkas and his Atlas group of companies were sued for fraud relating to co-involvement in Skyway. Red Sea was also involved with several additional public issuers including SLS International, Inc. GeneThera, Inc., and Freedom Golf Corporation. To that end, the SEC also sued Red Sea, alleging that it conducted “fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes on behalf of its clients and laundered millions of dollars in illegal trading proceeds out of the United States to its clients overseas.” Red Sea was also tied to online gambling, money laundering, short-term payday loans, and bootlegged/pirated TV shows.""

&#x200B;

TL;DR and Summary

Blink Charging Company's claim of operating over 15,000 charging units is misleading on two accounts: only 2,192 can be accessed by consumers and the average charger earns a revenue of just $6.37 annually.

Blink's cumulative earnings are abysmal yet employee compensations remain sky-high, $18 million to $44 million since 2014 respectively. Meanwhile, CEO Michael Farkas continues to dump millions of shares and collect a salary of $548,000. 

Farkas also has a long history with massive criminal schemes and generally fraudulent behavior. If that's not enough, an 8.88% owner of Blink is also directly tied to the panama papers.

In conclusion, Blink Charging is just another scam by CEO Michael Farkas. It has courted investors with a vision of the future and a façade of long-term viability. In reality, its slowly bleeding out and the only person benefitting is Farkas.

UPDATE: 
Many people are wondering, “why not short or put Blink right now?” As some have pointed out, since the August 2020 Culper Research report and subsequent Mariner Research Group downgrade, Blink’s share price has actually increased from roughly 10$ to its current price. Clearly, the investors don’t care about the inherent risk of their investment. However, a lawsuit was filed in October and is currently underway (website for relevant updates: https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/BLNK). Investor fraud lawsuits generally take 2-4 years to be resolved and it’s possible that these repercussions won’t be felt by Blink or fully realized by investors until that date. In the meantime, there are too many possibilities for Blink, whether that’s a management adjustment or immediate bankruptcy, and it’s just too risky to take that long of a position.","['COO', 'TSLA', 'EL']"

It needs some positive news, like landing a big bus order, otherwise this might trade below $10 until they can start delivering vehicles and becoming cash flow positive.

There is a typical lull in mining stocks between the date the funding is secured (some excitement around how much money will be made in two years when they go into production), and when they actually get into production.  Perhaps the same will be said of EV startups, although they may have the interim benefit of exciting presales figures, and you can't predict when a large order will hit the books.

mhcka8,,stocks,post,1617215732,"Pacific Biosciences of California (PACB) DD# Pacific Biosciences of California (PACB)

PACB is a Gene-sequencing company. Gene-sequencing is about reading and learning genes. Its able to locate abnormallities/deviations in gene, leading to diagnosing rare diseases or finding a way to fix known diseases that yet need a solution. (fixing diabetes for example)

Gene sequencing is what makes gene editing possible. (Gene-editing is where you change your genes, that can cure disease or atleast treat a disease) All though Gene-editing is still quite new, a combination of these sciences could change the world and its healthcare.

‘’Ok cool.. but Pacbio isnt the only company doing this.’’

That is true, what makes PACB special is that not only are they global leader on long read sequencing technology. They massively improved gene sequencing, called Hi-Fi ‘’smart sequencing’’. Which is the most accurate long read sequencing technology on the market.

Their flagship model Sequel lle has $700 cost savings per human genome, has a 90% reduction in data storage needs and has around 75% reduction in data analysis time.

What I really like is that their new CEO Christain Henry is a businessman. PACB’s number one objective is to expand their global reach, the sale force has doubled this year and PACB is more  focussed on marketing and customer support to enable growth. They also received a 900million dollar of Softbank to accelerate their growth regarding product development and commercial aspects and another thing that i would like to add is that Labcore is doing research on Covid-19 using PACBIO technology.

# Financials (in millions)

**Revenue (TTM):** 78 million**Cost of revenue(TTM):** 46 million**Gross profit(TTM):**  32 million

**Solvency**  
PACB has a common stock equity of $335,491 and total essets of 413,980.

335,491/413,980x100 = 81,04%. I wonderd if i calculated this right, otherwise its a great result.

**Debt to assets**  
PACB has a debt of 41,99941,999/413,980 = 10,15% which is also totally fine for me.

**Profitability**  
PACB has a net income of $29,403 if you devide that by the common stock equity of $335,491 you get a profitability of 8.7%.

**EPS**  
EPS of 0.17 TTM  
EPS of 0.18 2020  
EPS of -0.55 2019 and EPS of 0.76 in 2018.

**P/E Ratio**

Now dont fall of your chair here. The EPS is 192.82. That is a lot. However keep in mind that you are paying for a bio science company that is focussing on the future. Development takes a lot of time and also costs a lot of money. For a big company like Illumina there is a P/E of 85.

This number does not say everything, but its a nice indicator that you are buying shares for what the company COULD become. Not what they are. You are always taking a risk.

**Loose numbers**

· The company holds a total cash of $318 million

· The marketcap is 6.038 billion. The market cap of ILMN is 55.4 billion

· Their forward P/E is -44.66

· Total inside shares are 4.7 million. (around $141 million)

· 99.44% % of Shares Held by Institutions!

· ARK investment has 28,504,629 shares.

# Negatives

· The stock is extremely volatile

· Balance sheet is ok but not great

· The competition is fierce

· The investment is RISKY. No matter how you look at it.

· The companies revenue and other financials are not stable, difficult to make a guess

· The stock price has had an enormous peek already, in July 2020 the stock price was $4.73, now its $32.50 per share.

· PACBIO still has to prove themselves to be succesful in the long run, its not a safe investment, it all comes down wether you believe in them or not

· People are afraid of gene-editing because people are speculating that rich people will be able to change the genes of their unborn babies, resulting in ‘’super babies’’. (genome editing)

# Conclussion

My girlfriend is a scientist who works with DNA sequencing, so through her i got the idea to start looking into the biotech market. I really like the CEO, I like how the company is growing and the most important part: i REALLY believe that gene seqeuncing and gene editing are the future of our health system. But she might also be a reason why i am biased.

The stock is risky, im -15% as for now and there are days the stock price jumps or falls 10%. I really dislike volatile stocks but for me, the company shows A LOT of potential.

I own quite some stocks and i will defenitly increase my portfolio monthly with this stock.

I am not really recommending this stock, because honestly, this stock could either be $3 or $100 of the end of the year and its also quite expensive.. But I do suggest looking into this company. They are fundamentally strong and I really like the fact that 4.7 million shares are hold with in the company, meaning that the people working for it themselves defenitly believe in it.

**TLDR**; I like the stock but its expensive. You are buying for what the company could be, not for what they are. Biotech is quite a gamble but the company has strong fundamentals.

Now I would like to end with two things:

This is not my entire DD, I havent shared ALL of the news, didnt share everything i know about the management and about the product it has. I did not want it to be too long.

Second is that I started investing in January 2020, if i make mistakes, i really appreciate it if you point that out. Even if i make very stupid mistakes, I am eager to learn so dont hold back.","['ILMN', 'BIO']"

mh6uu9,gsx3zit,stocks,comment,1617201789,"> why wouldn't I sell a put deep ITM like strike 190 @67

You can certainly do this. However, you would probably would be waiting, and sitting on 19k in cash, until close to expiration when the stock will (probably) be assigned to you.  

If the stock moves against you, you'll still be paying 190 dollars a share. If the stock moves in your direction, and the option price falls, you'd be able to buy to close the position and keep the remaining premium. 

The risk is that you'll be sitting on 19,000 dollars in cash that could be doing something else while you wait for the contract to get close to expiry and the stock to be assigned to or for it to be profitable for you to buy back your option and close the position.

> The premium I receive ($6,700) would far exceed any short-term losses

This isn't correct. The intrinsic value of the contract you would sell is about 67 dollars. The extrinsic value of the contract is effectively 0 (no one expects apple to trade at 190). The share price is about 123. You'll collect the 6700 when you sell the option, but you are still obligated to buy the shares at 190. If the shares fall to 120, you are still out 3 dollars a share even considering the premium you received for the contract. If the shares fall more, you lose more. 

A more common way to make this trade would be to sell something closer to the money. Selling a put at 120 at 51 DTE, nets you 430 in premium. If it is assigned, great, you wanted to shares anyway, if not then you made ~3.75% on your 12k in 51 days. Selling at 125 makes it more like that you will be assigned, and you'd collect 6.75 in premium for your trouble.","['DTE', 'AAPL']"

mgvaxl,,stocks,post,1617155005,"Why does it seem like selling at a loss is absolutely not an option on here? I would like to grant you the power the sell... IN THE RED!I'll admit, I'm a pessimistic person by default. I also can become insanely optimistic to the point that my family would like to get me a room at the local hospital. As we all know the stock market is a game of emotions. I think we mistakenly believe that selling for a loss is a form of weakness or defeat. Or we might fear we can't live with ourselves if it goes up again without us owning it. I see new traders that get down double digit percentage points and start calculating how many months they will have to hold to get their money back. 

When my trade starts going sour I decide to cut my losses and move on. Sometimes I regret it and sometimes I'm really happy I did.

A few things to remember.


1. ""Honest"" DD on a speculative company is extremely hard to come by. Usually you only see what they want you to see until the earnings report comes out. Just because your DD tells you hold forever doesn't mean it'll work out. Even if you read the whole internet.


2. Even a great company can be purchased at the wrong time. Wait for a pull back. Be patient. Even as Amazon hits all time highs you still should wait for an entry point. It's not that you'll ""lose money"" over the long term, it's just that you can get stuck trading sideways for months. If you buy high you can get stuck in the red for months. Watch the RSI (relative strength index) for a value in the 30s or 40s before jumping in at least. 


3. Dollar cost averaging isn't just a fad. It makes a ton of sense. Buy half of your position so that you can buy another half later if the stock drops significantly (relative to you) below your purchase price. If it doesn't dip further then good for you. Buy your other half on a pullback above your cost basis or be content with the half position.


4. Always have an exit strategy when you purchase the stock. Even if your exit strategy is ""hold it until I retire."" Don't purchase a stock without an exit strategy. That exit strategy should include a maximum loss amount along with a potential gains amount. Stick a stop loss (or have a dca price target) at your max loss. Once the stock gets above your gain goal stick a stop loss at that level. Let it keep running if it will or sell if it doesn't. Minimizing losses is more important than people give it credit for in this sub. 


5. Did the reason that you purchased the stock change? If so, SELL IT. If you bought the stock because you believed something would happen and it doesn't, sell it. Whether it's a loss, or gain, or break even. Your emotions will get the best of you if the reason for buying the stock is no longer valid. You won't be able to hold through the dips or recognize if you should take profits when you should. 


6. Diversification. It's easier to hold red when you have green along side of it. Buy stocks in other sectors. As we've all seen first hand this year, money moves around more than it comes out of the market. Rebalance your portfolio from time to time. Choose a sector you don't have money in and find a stock you like. Or choose an ETF.


7. Easy money gained is easy money loss. The quicker your stock moved up the quicker your stock can go down. Don't be scared to take profits! You will NEVER time the top right. 


8. You can't win them all. Self explanatory. 


Even with all that in mind, luck is involved. Nobody knows what will happen with any given stock so expect the unexpected. Having money stuck on a trade moving sideways for 12 months is worse than taking the loss and putting it elsewhere in my opinion. 

I started this post with intentions of a quick reminder that it's ok to sell for a loss sometimes and it became some sort of ""tips"" to remember post from another amateur trader on the internet.

mgp4mf,,stocks,post,1617135859,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 30, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 30, 2021**

The broader market finished lower following another volatile session, but interestingly, many individual stocks that were beaten down in recent weeks surged. Market participants continue to digest the sudden unwinding in stocks by a large hedge fund and an elevated Treasury yield.

Yesterday, Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the fear stemming from Archegos’ margin call, new data shows encouraging signs that the economy is recovering.  In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

However, concerns from market participants remained centered on the pace of economic recovery. With the recent passage of more stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future may cause a rapid spike in inflation.

E.g. buy a stock (OPEN position), sell the stock (CLOSE position) to realize a loss, buy back same stock (OPEN position) within 30 days of your sale for new cost basis.  You are now in violation.

E.g. sell a put (OPEN position), buy back put (CLOSE position), sell same put (re-OPEN position).

mg91ws,,stocks,post,1617083224,"Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV PlatformChoi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

mg91ws,gssc4ha,stocks,comment,1617100985,"I'm sceptical. This is at odds with both company's positions for the last several years.

Toyota has loudly stated that their primary path is hybrid ICE/EV towards a final goal of Hydrogen fuel cells. There was a presentation came out about 18months/2 years ago on it, and there's been nothing released that I've seen contradicting that plan (until this rumour). Furthermore Mr Toyoda has been publicly dismissive of Tesla, it would be very culturally odd for a Japanese ~~CEO~~ President (Edit wrong title) to step away from those unusually strong words and back into partnership.

Similarly this isn't congruent with Tesla's stated plans (although they are far more likely to do an abrupt change than Toyota). They have stated they're happy to sell their skateboard when they have spare capacity (ie production capability exceeds demand), but they've also made it very clear that their primary focus in the car space is the ""machine that builds the machine"" (in Musk's words) - that is they're focussed on developing their ability to build their gigafactories and the optimisation of the build cycle (the single piece casting of entire subframes etc ""giga press"" as they call it) and FSD. Trying to get a partner up to speed on their software platforms is going to divert a lot of resources away from their core goals and isn't in line with the way Musk has behaved for the last 5 years across all his companies.

If Tesla were looking for a Japanese partner to crack into that space, wouldn't a smaller player like Honda or Subaru be a more logical choice than a company that has been very negative about their previous experience with them ?","['ICE', 'TSLA']"

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as  I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

1. Prime brokerages sold Archegos total return swaps which allowed Archegos to gain equity exposure and leverage without owning the equity
2. for some reason (still unsure and somewhat unknown) Archegos was hit with a margin call (rumored to be around $6bn see CNBC article [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/wall-street-reels-from-archegos-fire-sale-with-questions-on-regulation.html))
3. Archegos defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund
4. The total value of equity exposure was around $20bn
5. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total return swap
6. Banks were forced to sell their position in large block trades
7.

Yes and no. Although we can't pin the exact moment - we know that Hwang was way overleveraged on margin, so at the slightest hint of something going south it probably set off some serious alarm bells for these prime brokers, and fast. 

$VIAC announced a huge $3bn secondary offering that morning and the stock took a huge hit very quickly. This might've been the beginning of the end for Archegos as a little while after that PR, we see the unwinding of these huge positions from prime brokers on the Archegos stocks (more $VIAC, then $DISCA/K, $GSX, etc.). 

What I speculate happened was that the $VIAC offering announcement got Archegos into some really hot water and they were margin called. They knew right away they were insolvent, and immediately began liquidating their long positions as the prime brokers simultaneously unloaded these ridiculous positions in ViacomCBS and Discovery. 

What I find most fascinating about the entire thing is the fact that, and correct me if I'm wrong, Goldman Sachs was the ONLY broker that actually hedged their positions against the Archegos ones and came out of this whole shitshow in the green. Goldman has a great reputation, but I can't believe nobody else thought to hedge here. It's not like they didn't know exactly what was going on.","['VIAC', 'DISCA']"

Many of the people that make a lot of money quickly in the market, underestimate the difficulty that it actually takes when the market inevitably calms down. This past year was a result of market euphoria and an astronomical amount of greed, which left many who had unrealized gains, with unrealized losses, and they are confused about what to do. 

When I first started investing, I have seen this scenario and I fell prey a bit. An example that comes to my mind was W.A.TT, a zombie company who spiked to 20$ only to be a worthless stock now. I cut my losses early, but it was lucky I did, because I wasn't knowledgeable to even know why I bought it aside from the point it was vertical. 

After that, I got smarter and bought nvidia, for around $200 a share, and then when at the end of 2018, the market sputtered and nvidia corrected heavily due to the nature of it's sector. I unknowingly screwed myself out of future gains because I didn't know the financials and didn't read enough, and I bought the RIGHT company, for the wrong reason. I sold for a loss. If I had held that, (and my other speculative, GREAT, buys, my portfolio would've tripled in 3 years. But I didn't understand why the stocks move downward. 

This is long and I apologise, but by doing the wrong things, it's led me to doing the right things, and my portfolio is calm and gaining through covid and through this rotation. When it comes to individual stock picking, you have to treat it like a job and read. Read everything you can. When it comes to market sentiment, it should almost be irrelevant. All stocks will go down, but if you hold stocks that you know won't stay down, you're stress levels will not be as high as someone who jumped into something with no entry or exit strategy. 

I will say that this isn't necessarily a guide and I won't give any specifics on how much of anything you should have, but understanding what should be present in a solid, safer growth/value portfolio to avoid losing large chunks of money during cyclical swings and market moves. Losing money is unavoidable in the market at some point, but being in a position to where it won't destroy confidence or your portfolio, is avoidable, and with work very achievable. 

A solid base for a portfolio is necessary, and I would say it should almost always include dividend stocks that you are willing to go long on. Safety should be majority of your portfolio, the big blue chips are boring, but they are your anchors, and will let your portfolio breathe naturally on down and up days and mitigate large swings. If youre like me and choose to use margin for leverage, dividends pay for your margin interest as well, but I don't recommend margin to people as it involves larger risk in general. 

The next part Is what helped me during covid so much, you look ahead and start to think of things as a contrarian, and realize that not all of your picks are correct, and you may need to adjust accordingly based on fundamentals. NEVER get attached to a stock, sometimes if you get gains on a speculative pick, you should take them, especially based on the market in late 2020. The rotation was written on the wall. 

Banks are safe havens as well, but more fickle, I own many banks but for me, I would not open positions on them now, I have however , since I've owned them, averaged up, which lowers my overall gains, but leaves me with much more room to fall before I have to potentially adjust the position, IF, the fall in price is a reflection of fundamentals.

Value stocks are getting less valuable. When you're building a portfolio, knowing how to find and assess value is important and ultimately up to the individual. A simple thing I do, which many may not agree is, I pick 3 stocks, one risky, one safe, and one moderate. I'll use the examples respectively, beyond meat (risk) , simply good foods (moderate) and kraft heinz. They all are completely different companies with vastly different markets I understand, but they all expose to food space with different amounts is risk in a sector. Now kraft may be a great base to my portfolio, but do I need less risk? Or is my dividend and safety base at a level where I am comfortable? Then I'd evaluate my overall portfolio risk tolerance and see if first of all, any of my picks should even be in my portfolio, and I usually will try and think and discover reasons why they don't, rather than why they should. 

Tech is something I do not like exposure to majority of the time, i keep it under 10%. But many great growth stocks are tech, but patience and cash are the next part of a portfolio, holding a cash position is important for being able to patiently wait and open riskier positions at a safer price, which in the cyclical nature of say, semiconductors (currently relative), can be hard. Opening a position in a good, healthy TECH, company all at once is not the best move in my opinion. Opening a position with the view that it may go down and will give you exposure and potential to average down, is a good mindset. Tech is a fickle industry and cyclical, and earnings are less important than guidance, unless the market is the way it is now, in which value is stealing the spotlight, imo, providing cheaper/ish entries to tech. 

Oil will always provide dividends, and by their nature will let you average down. Oil especially, as a regulated business due to opec, you are at the mercy of a business that is not really traded on the free market. Supply and demand will sometimes get so out of synch and provide good buying opportunities. I bought oil early, in may, halliburton , exxon suncor and devon. Contrarian plays last year, but this year's quick in and out fad. It took patience, but I cashed out quite nicely, and still hold some for the dividends. 

Industrials, deserve a part in anyone's portfolio. It goes without saying that this should be a decent chunk of your portfolio, they are cyclical ny nature and may swing based on office encumbants and world issues, but they are the backbone of the world and when you can pick a convicted and tried and true winner, can be of great value and safe , long term growth. 

Commodities are commodities and always should have some exposure, these are stocks that I tend to adjust the most, as they face fundamental changes often and are subject to world trade/trends sometimes (clothing). When it comes to food, I tend to pick safer, dividend oriented companies, I try to pick these up only if I see them with great value attached, near all time highs, I tend to wait and watch. 

Mining stocks are good to go right now, but they are a bit risky, ones with dividends and in relation to precious metals may see a bit of a boom, but that is honestly and industry I don't dabble in much, I have my picks, but due diligence and understanding how they make money is important.

In my opinion, risk is for chumps, anything over 3% of your portfolio in gamblingesque stocks, is a bit more fugazzi than it is fun, and can lead to impulsive moves of you don't regulate your mindset. Also, this is about portfolios and for newer people who may have had a hard time with this VERY SMALL market move that somehow ruined people's portfolios. Limited risk does not mean limited gain. Unless your a trader. And I'm not, so I'm boring. But I make money, I hope any of this helps. Went on a bit long but I wanted to get into some sectors that have really helped me since before covid, and throughout as well since I was able to recognize the bargains in price. 

The more you watch the numbers, the better you understand the numbers. But don't watch them everyday, or you can become paranoid, be convicted, do research, and whenever buying anything, that behind the stock, it has fundamental value. Even growth stocks that get slashed in half SOMETIMES can be good holds, but you must be prepared to adjust of you're not right. Knowledge is power, and knowledge will keep your money busy.","['NVDA', 'KHC', 'TT', 'HAL']"

I liked the drug technology they were developing and I was looking to hold the stock for quite some time. I even rode past all time highs of 40% profit. My plan was to hold until they would reach later stages of FDA approval, or better yet they actually get approved. It is money I am ready to lose and a bit of gambling makes the stock market more fun.

Yesterday after hours, the firm announced a secondary offering of shares. The market obviously reacted poorly and since then the stock has dropped 25%. I don't have access to after hours so there was no way I could consider selling out temporarily or even permanently. I've generally had two different investing strategies: buy & forget, or momentum. This was a buy & forget. However, I've never had to deal with dilution with any of my previous investments so now I feel a bit like a fish out of water. A second offering is essentially a debt issue, but how bad of a bearish signal is it? Should I just jump ship and get out while I still can, or should I stick to being a bagholder as I intended.

When this faucet shuts off, it'll be tough for some to keep up with their car payments.

Car loans used to be 3-5 years, now I see some drawn out 10 or more, most are over 5 I'm guessing, with barely anyone taking on the 36 month payments. Doesn't seem right. 

I get the argument that cars are holding their value longer these days.

In the case that they can't pay back the loan, the car is returned to the financing company who will sell it and it'll be cost-neutral. 

If you mean people taking out bank loans and using the stimulus cheque as a deposit for example, the bank should have done their due diligence as to whether the person being given the loan is in a suitable position. That includes whether their income will continue. If the person can't pay, there are already systems in place that allow money or assets to be removed to offset the loan. 

In either case, the financiers are insured twice basically. Once because they have such a vast expanse of people who are paying to them, if a small percentage default, it doesnt affect the whole operation. And secondly by typical insurance. 

The companies that would suffer if in 4 years time the loans systems collapsed are the small local firms who actually probably don't do their own distribution of loans because that needs a huge amount of capital, and also are probably small enough that they dont distribute shares anyway",['HPQ']

mgqhac,,stocks,post,1617139684,"Whats changed with ICLN HoldingsICLN recently published their holdings as of March 29th, and I haven't seen any posts addressing it, nor have I seen a post give the details of what's changed. Below is a table of the holdings before vs now. I've sorted it by their weight before, so you can see how the heavier stocks have shifted. There were cases where they gave 2 seperate columns for the same symbol, but I decided to keep them seperate for simplicity. Some notable changes:

\- iShares bought 200k more shares of PLUG

\- 65 million shares of ELP were bought

\- ICLN now holds €17 million in cash

\- 1.7 billion KRW was sold(Worth approx €12k)

\- The only position which was reduced was $NEOEN

Stumbled across this stock while browsing the ASX list. BET makes software used by wagering companies to place bets for clients. Approximately 700% increase in stock price over the past 12 months. However, the stock is highly overvalued. It is not yet profitable. (Expected to become profitable in 2023 according to Simply Wall St), but, it is partnered with some of the largest betting/wagering companies in Australia such as Neds, Sportsbet, and Ladbrokes, so as they grow, logically BET will grow too.

mgua43,,stocks,post,1617151593,How to figure out FDA approvesI see all these stocks that go up 50% because they get an approved FDA trial and was just wondering what the best resources were to research these stocks before they get information. I know that getting the results before hand is a no no bur is there places where you can get up to date research on what stocks are close to disclosing what is happening with their drug. I haven't been trading long so any help is good.,
mgua43,gsv90k7,stocks,comment,1617154116,"You need to know a lot about the industry and the specifics about the drug. You need to be able to digest the clinical trials and scrutinize the materials/methods and endpoints of the clinical trials and THEN figure out if something up for FDA approval will be clinically significant to be approved, which is really difficult. For example, there was a trial for a NASH drug from Intercept/ICPT that showed histological improvement in liver fibrosis BUT it was not determined that it had clinical benefit to be approved at the time of the trial end point (REGENERATE is the trial name). You gotta be able to understand stuff like that to have any sense of if something will be approved. I work in healthcare, I do spend a decent amount of time digesting these kinds of things for investing purposes and I still don't get it. It's not impossible but it requires a certain amount of insight, whether it's drug approval or a product launch or service being successful in any other industry.

mgwxlj,,stocks,post,1617160562,"FTC sues Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with GrailIn an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

For most companies like Amazon, Netflix or John Deere, the part that has something to do with space or profits from space is less than 5%. Not even remotely worth mentioning, that doesn't justify inclusion in such an ETF.

Now that the pickings aren't as easy and the market is getting back to a place of being flat/volatile I want to step my game up a bit. I've already purchased some books and found some youtubers I like but my question is this; Are professional research services like Motley fool stock adviser, Tip ranks premium, Zacks premium etc... worth it? Do they actually provide meaningful investing insights that would be hard to get on your own or are they just a money grabbing trap for new folks. If so which ones do you guys feel are the best.

I'm not paid by them and have nothing to do with them, except that I'm a relatively new customer.Cons:- when you subscribe, you have to explain to everyone who knows them that you are NOT paying for their crappy junk free articles; in my eyes, they are hurting their business so much by producing this free garbage- many (but not all) recommended stocks seem like obvious picks (such as, buy Amazon)- they start selling you on MORE services for even CRAZIER returns, and they use outdated, annoying, pathetic marketing.

I don't recommend using any source of research at all but what you can do yourself, because everybody is full of it. Nobody is your friend.

But a premium service with a good history, you can just compare their results to your own and know what you're getting.

A youtube channel, you don't know what you're getting, and they can delete videos that were duds. They're not going to have the time in the market that the premium services have, either.

mh1zc3,gswgjxp,investing,comment,1617186949,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['NDAQ', 'SPGI', 'DOW', 'ADP']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

What's best practice in such a case? 

1.) Realize the gains and reinvest 

2.) Realize the whole fund and wait for the (inevitable?!) correction to re-invest at a lower point

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

My experiment right now is using 3x leveraged etfs as my primary holdings (TQQQ, UPRO, TNA) and balance those with equivalent covered call fund (QYLD, XYLD, RYLD, and for bonus some SLVO) - for cash on hand positions in case of a drawdown.

I'm probably insane, don't try this unless you know what you're doing. I sure as heck don't!!

mhaez0,,investing,post,1617209689,"ZDGE - 80% revenue growth at a 45 PE ratio offers 90% upside (DD)(First DD, constructive criticism appreciated)

**What is Zedge?**

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

&#x200B;

**Thanks for reading, and would like to hear any thoughts**

**Disclosure: Long ZDGE obviously**

**TLDR: 80% revenue growth for FY21, heavy insider buying, pe ratio of 45**",['MMM']

mhaez0,gsxqvf2,investing,comment,1617212160,"This may sound hand-wavey, and I suppose it is, but something doesn't smell good to me. The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up. Like I said, I don't know if this is true, and I didn't see an answer in my 5 second Google search. Having tried literally all options myself (/s), it's now up to you.",['GOOGL']
mhaez0,gsxplgr,investing,comment,1617211588,"Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

Imo analyzing a company is a bit like war gaming. You have to consider the unfriendly territory, competitors and macro factors (think of them as possibly inclement weather or other macro adversity in case of war) and analyze the possible scenarios and outcomes considering the best potential moves of adversaries.",

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion**  
MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",

It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

As a global play I hypothesize that developing countries will be on the rise in the next 5-10 years. I'm reluctant to do China and most of southeast asia due to heavy influence of politics, but India seems to geographically, and mentally, be positioned for best growth in the future. I want to avoid ETFs and also non-US listed companies as I think US regulation is beneficial to transparency and hopefully helps keep companies straight, at least to a point). Motivated by this thinking i took up finviz with a basic filter of India based companies, sorted by market cap, and then further looked into how the charts, analyst recommendations and social media sentiment looks. 

I landed on these three tickers, sorted into a convenient screener for whoever is interested in discussing on this post:

I'll probably do a bit of basic fundamental analysis later but I thought there might be people here who are way ahead of me.

mfs7vk,,investing,post,1617032204,"Stock Scraper Trending Data as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

As of now, searching under Reddit all, there is roughly 450 tickers under 500. So you will then go through the 450 tockers and delete any that aren't real. So maybe it goes down to 400. Not sure. Now after you do a few other steps you're left with 10-15 tickers. My question is how do you manage to go from 450 tickers down to 10-15. This would be a week-long project for myself. Anyways, if you could elaborate on that it would be great. Thanks so much, I am having a good time here. Just overwhelmed with 400 tickers to go thru. ",

I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...
_______________________
Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

You present several statements that raise certain questions.  For example:

1.	""Its PE ratio is similar to EA.""  It's trading at 15x book value... Why should I invest in EA or Activision if I can find a dozen or so companies that are trading at a significant discount?  You invoke the Graham/Buffett concept ""margin of safety"" but DCF analysis puts  its fair value between $71 and $78 per share.  That's the opposite of margin of safety.
2.	""has no intangible assets"" ... No? What's the $1.8 billion in accumulated intangible amortization?  You can't amortize assets you don't have.
3.	""Strong balance sheet""... what was the $18 million unrealized loss in Q3 of 2020 due to?
4.	How about the $6.8 billion in Goodwill?  That's an intangible asset.  What acquisitions are related to this and if they're still carrying this value, why would it be better for them to spend the $8 billion on more acquisitions than stock repurchases given that:
5.	"" but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance.""  Is it?  I see $11 billion in APIC.  Again: In these economically uncertain times, why would more acquisitions be better than share repurchases?
6.	""Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.""  What's the $194 million write down of AR in Q4 2020?  There's a quarterly carrying value around $83 million as a provision for doubtful accounts.  What's the connection between these two items and why could its resurgence to 2017 levels present a material impairment to their business, particularly under current economic conditions?

What concerns me is that you approach the analysis from the Graham angle of value and margin of safety, yet present no discussion of the indicators of the same.  The underpinnings of due diligence are in the data, which aren't presented or discussed in your analysis.  It's not that the above questions all have displeasing answers, but rather that these are the kind of questions you should be anticipating and addressing in your due diligence.

Due diligence is not an attempt to pitch me the prettiest profile of the company.   It's got to be a kicking of the tires, asking the tough questions, and seeing whether your hypothesis holds up to serious scrutiny.... and these are just questions I, as a relatively average FP&A guy, came up with glancing at the financials for five minutes, and it's not because I have a particular view of the company, but that is precisely the point.  Your analysis needs to be thorough and objective.",['EA']

mfkoyj,,investing,post,1617005626,"BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial ResultsUp until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

mfbyli,,investing,post,1616971610,"Investing in Helium - DMEHF DD **Investing in Desert Mountain Energy (DME.V, DMEHF)**

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

"" Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon "" Helium demand did not exceed supply last year, largely due to decreased use during the pandemic. 

"" Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining. "" Terming this companies financials as ""good"" is uh... a stretch. They raised some money (not enough to execute their plan) and they don't spend much because they aren't doing much.

"" Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day."" Test well (singular) has shown this. As mentioned previously the second well is much much worse, mostly in terms of flow rate, but the helium percentage is a bit over half as much as well.

"" Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less. ""  This seems to assume all wells are as good as the first and not as bad as the second. 

Finally, you use analysis from the cormark report here: [https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom\_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom](https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom)"" but gave a $20+ price target while ignoring their $4.25 price target.  If you're going to use their info you should probably also at least mention their price target.

I am by no means trying to convince people to stay away from this one. I just am presenting the other side for you.  You should be aware you're paying 128 million for 13 million, a plan, some leases and a few holes in the ground at least one of which seems to produce a significant amount of helium. That's pretty much how most companies start, but people should be aware this is still really early stages and a lot could still go wrong.",

mfdia0,,investing,post,1616976808,"Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice.",

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

mf2pu6,,investing,post,1616944490,"Coursera: A DD IntroductionDisclaimer: This is my first DD, so please forgive any gaps, omissions, or mistakes. I welcome any and all (constructive) comments and criticisms. Secondly, as is obligatory, *this is not to be construed as financial advice*.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['ICE', 'DE', 'TSLA']"

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['ED', 'ES', 'SPGI', 'GS', 'WAT', 'BAC']"

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC

* 10% AVUV
* 16% XEF

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

meu01j,gsk1rtx,investing,comment,1616911277,"I think Schiller did a lot of detriment to his stellar reputation with excess CAPE. This concept is pretty controversial among prominent investors and economists. It’s like, here’s one very overpriced asset and another very very overpriced asset and when we compare them to each other they don’t look so expensive. Like houses in LA are really cheap because houses in San Jose are expensive. 

I’m a big CAPE believer, just think excess CAPE is nonsense.",
meu01j,gsomxj5,investing,comment,1617023727,"I have a portion of my active investment allocation in a tactical asset allocation strategy that uses expected excess returns of SP500 relative to 10 year treasuries to determine allocation. SP500 10YR expected total returns are forecast using a valuation model (not CAPE but similar enough) to predict price return plus current dividend yield. 10YR treasury expected returns are estimated as current yield. The historical error in forecast versus realized realized 10 year return is used to evaluate the probability that stocks will outperform treasuries. I use this probability directly as an allocation target. In other words, if stocks are predicted to have a 90% probability of outperforming treasuries I allocate 90% to stocks and 10% to treasuries. If the probability is 50%, I allocated 50/50. I use a 24 month moving average of the probability to smooth the allocation and slow down transition in allocation. This slows transition from equity to bonds and vice versa. 

In general, I find that active strategies that use a probabilistic transition in allocation are more robust and easier to live with than strategies that make an all in 0% to 100% switch in allocation. Valuations don't switch instantly so I don't see why you'd want a strategy to switch allocation instantly. You're ""optimized"" 2% threshold probably has closer to 50/50 probability of either stock or bond outperformance - it makes more sense to take a 50/50 allocation until the valuation becomes more extreme one way or the other.

As you say, historically it's rare for the 10 year forecast of stock return to be less than the forecast for bond return so this strategy tends to be heavily allocated to stocks.

This incredibly simple strategy has actually been one of the most consistent performing of strategies I follow over the past 2 years.",

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

mea4sx,gshjot9,investing,comment,1616869480,"I just bought my first shares! I would appreciate it if someone could listen to my reasoning and give me some feedback.

I decided to purchase a few shares from Avantium (AVTX). 

This company is a spinoff from Shell, and their goal is to develop efficient green industrial processes to transform raw carbohydrates from “waste” sources such as wood chips into useful chemical compounds. This is a local company and I visited one of their buildings about two years ago during a university trip, and I saw that their building is modern and well-equipped. Some research groups from my university work with them and I am aware of the work that they are doing. So I have some level of understanding of the technologies that they are developing, and I can see first-hand that the investment that they put into R&D is not being wasted. 

Their current market cap is 138 million euros.  I think that this makes it a very cheap stock, and I expect to see considerable growth. My reasoning is the following:

The company is planning to build the first commercial FDCA plant. FDCA is a sugar-derived compound that can be polimerized into a bioplastic, most notable PEF, which is a leading candidate to replace PET plastics. The industrial process relies mainly on green cyclic catalytic processes. European legislation against standard plastics and in favor of green chemical processes will incentivize companies to use FDCA in the coming years.

At the moment the construction of the FDCA is still uncertain, as they have conditionally secured only 95 of the 150 million euros of funding that they need. This represents a risk, and I think that this is part of what is keeping the share value so low. I think that it is very likely that the company will secure the funding later this year, and this should cause the stock price to increase due to the lowered risk.  
I have tried to get an idea of how much this company could be worth in a few years. I think that AkzoNobel is a nice reference, as it is dutch company that develops paints and coatings and was founded in 1994. Its market cap is 18 billion euros. I also looked at companies that produce PET, and chose Eastman Chemical Company as a reference - its market cap is 15 billion.   
I think that I am not being too optimistic when I say that the market cap of Avantium could be above 2 billion euros 10 years from now. Since the current cap is 138 million, this means that on average an investment on this company would result in an average return on investment of 40% over the next 10 years.   
Putting it in these terms and looking at that 40% yearly ROI figure makes me think that I may be being far too optimistic about the growth of the company. What should I do to come up with more reasonable predictions? Am I thinking too far ahead?   
If you read this far, thanks a lot! Any feedback would be very welcome.",['EMN']

mdppti,,investing,post,1616768452,"SoFi to give amateur investors early access to IPOshttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/sofi-to-give-amateur-investors-early-access-to-ipos-in-break-from-wall-street-tradition-.html

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs.

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

#  Comparison volatility

Beta

 Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index – **XIU**                             0.91 

 Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp – **XIC**           0.98 

 BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp – **ZCN**                      0.98 

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

me5yvd,gsg9s8m,investing,comment,1616854676,Thanks! I'm a complete idiot but is there really a 'bad' choice between these 4 ETFs?,
mefd3f,,investing,post,1616857044,"DD on digital health company OptimizeRx (OPRX) 

A  company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the  following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its  business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another  industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the  future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx  operates as a digital health company that provides communications  solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

I like this, I think it's a really good idea; and dealing directly with sales staff means they will pay. Companies don't always pay for quality, but they do pay for sales.

&#x200B;

Whats their addressable market? say it takes off & becomes a staple; how much will insurance companies pay them?

My concern is Insurance companies are shitty, shitty business partners to have; when you do business with a monopoly expect to get fleeced. How hard would it be for Insurance companies to replace them with their own software development teams; realistically how much can OPRX charge before they do so?

&#x200B;

In Buffets terms; companies need a 'moat'. Nobody is going to pay OPRX **unless they have to.** How can OPRX force its customers to pay?

Also, I thought management's discussion about opportunities in EHR was pretty compelling:

""Like no other digital health platform in the market, we deliver important information in real time at the point-of-care right when clinical decisions are being made. We have access to 10s of millions of patients and most physicians, as well as the technology compliance operational support to continue to play a major role in the ever evolving digital health market.

Our partnerships with EHR and e-prescribing companies enable us to augment that physician workflow with actionable insights by providing additional real time critical information to clinicians who are dealing everyday with complex healthcare scenarios. We can improve the patient and physician experience and ultimately treatment outcomes.""

My allocation is below. I started with the [golden butterfly](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/golden-butterfly/) portfolio but eventually molded it to have a higher stock percentage, added some international stocks, and moved some of the gold into silver and bitcoin. Can anyone recommend any ideas on how I could diversify more? I am contemplating international treasuries via IGOV, but this is cash-like so I'm not sure if it's a meaningful add to my long-term portfolio. I am also contemplating commodities.

* 10% Total International Stock Market
* 30% Long-term treasuries (10-20yr)
* 15% Gold
* 2.5% Silver

UPDATE: After giving it some thought, I am going to transition to the portfolio allocation below. In effect, I am just increasing my overall stock allocation, weighting more towards international stocks, and lowering my treasury allocation...but over time I am going to move into longer-term treasuries as rates continue to rise. I will do this slowly. Not going to sell anything really, just going to focus where my newly invested money is going. Everyone's panties are in a bunch over my 20% allocation to metal/bitcoin, but that is so small in the scope of things.

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['WFC', 'BLK', 'SPGI']"

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.

But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic’s scarring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March.

mcpqqp,,investing,post,1616645951,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['NDAQ', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'AAPL']"

- Historically the S&P 500 has destroyed the MSCI world index 
- I’m in Australia and the management fee for s&p500 is 0.04% vs 0.19% for an all world index. 

2. All World Index 
- offers diversification, in the case the US doesn’t prevail in the future 
- doesn’t take any bets on countries or sectors, just purely let’s successful countries run through as winners. 
- perhaps a greater sleep at night factor?

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

>  
>The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products.

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above. 

>An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

mcqwym,,investing,post,1616650283,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Company announcement: [https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021](https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021)

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['QCOM', 'INTC', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"

      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.

It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.

This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.

>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['GOOGL', 'NFLX', 'AAPL', 'IP', 'MSFT', 'CRM', 'NI', 'AMZN', 'FB', 'GS']"

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

^(7) [^(https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)](https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

In the *trial*, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the Company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal *Phase* 2/3 *trial*s by year end 2021 – one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.

""We're pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the *Stellar* *trial*, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the *Phase* 2/3 pivotal *trial*s,"" said Aniz Girach, MD, Chief Medical Officer of ProQR, ""With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated *clinical* proof of concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision. As expected, we saw benefits in both advanced and early-moderate patients in this slow progressing, debilitating eye disease, allowing us to advance this important investigational therapy for all patients with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations. Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal *trial*s, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through *clinical* *develop*ment.""

""The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,"" said Robert Koenekoop, MD, MSc, PhD, FRCS(C), FARVO, a *clinical*\-scientist from the Montreal Children's Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surgery. ""Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients' biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal *trial* *develop*ment."" ",

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",

mbvs0e,gs1o9xi,investing,comment,1616592794,"~~Can you give the table number? Table 7 on pg 379 of the full prospectus is maybe what you’re looking at?~~

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['ADI', 'JPM']"

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

Their current fair value is $415 and the sit at $350 they pay some of the highest dividends on the market as well at 3%. Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). 

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I'd take this over a savings accnt anyday.

mb7dzn,grwejpc,investing,comment,1616478641,"LMT is about 10% of my portfolio and I have high hope for it, but there's really no guaranteed easy money. I initially bought at 370 and keep buying more and more on its way down to 320s, so now I just broke even.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

Check out the ones with the fastest growth of followers over the past month.I’ve been collecting data from major social networks - companies’ pages on FB, Twitter, Instagram, LI for 2 months. Then the collected data was aggregated into a historical perspective and I discovered 5 companies that are most actively growing in the number of their followers in the media.

This is a continuation of a series of posts related to the indirect metrics of public companies, here are the rest - [traffic’s growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mceny3/ive_analyzed_the_websites_of_the_top_3000_public/), [number of employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md7y4m/ive_been_analyzing_the_data_on_employee_growth/), [hiring dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mfwjwe/ive_analyzed_job_openings_for_the_top_3k_public/). 

**Why am I doing this?** I believe that indirect companies' metrics are related to their stock price. When more historical data accumulates, I will try to find a statistical correlation between the indirect indicators of the company's performance (traffic, employees, ratings from employees, behavior in social networks) with its stock price and publish a post with the results of my whole research.

We have 2 types rock base REE which is expensive to process/mine and has radioactive tailings which can be an added expense or much lower Capex - Clay Based REE.

In Uganda an Australia company **Ionic Rare Earth's Limited** listed on the ASX ticker **IXR** has announced that it has a massive deposit, in fact the worlds biggest deposit and it's on the surface. The company is drilling again now so the resource will double again as early indications are very positive.

The rare earth minerals are in huge demand by China, USA, India and Japan. Obviously these 17 critical minerals are needed for mobile phone, medical, military missiles and weapons and space exploration and in massive demand and world shortage. Independent brokers are saying that the SP of 5c AUD will triple in weeks as the company is about to release it's important Scoping Study which will assist to coming into production fast tracking this by off take agreements which imo will happen very soon. 

Importantly the world needs to urgently secure supplies of Rare Earths REE and the USA under the new Quad agreement recently signed by the USA, Australia, India and Japan, are urgently focused of preventing China's dominance of these minerals. The great thing is Australia's biggest hard rock REE company Lynas LYC has secured deals with USA. 

The China v's world is heating up over Rare Earth REE guys so worth having a look at REE companies like IXR is the best imo, then we have Canadian VML who are going into production after raising $43 Mil and little specy stock EMT, all seen on [www.asx.com.au](https://www.asx.com.au) and commentary on Hot Copper Australia.

We also don't have the charging infrastructure to support the electric vehicles and also it being a luxury car, only the rich and prosperous can afford it since the people who can afford it are 1% of the working population of the country. This means that Tesla is going to be having a tough time in India and won't be able to sell more than 50-100 vehicles over the next few years.   


As for their fundamentals, their earnings has been down the last quarter with a 15% lower EBIT from the third quarter, and it looks like their third quarter is going to have the most sales this year too. As for the technicals TSLA could be caught in a bull-trap. The stock has been up a good 5% due to high expected deliveries but it is highly likely to underperform and get lesser sales than the expected 170,000 cars. The volumes have been significantly decreasing over the past year and there are strong resistance lines, also forming a bearish pennant pattern and has hit the resistance line 3 times as of yesterday in the daily time frame. There is a strong sign that Tesla might break out downwards over the next few weeks. 

&#x200B;

Assuming 90% of their sales this year is also going to be the Model 3/Y sales their average profit being around 15k USD per car their earnings are going to be around 11.34B dollars and 2.6B dollars for their Model X/S, accounting for total earnings of about 14B dollars, and at a P/E ratio of 14 they will be worth around 196B dollars if this is fulfilled only with respect to their automobile sector. In this DD I haven't taken the energy sector into consideration and I assume their energy sector to be around 50B dollars in worth, which results in a worth of around 250B$ and a price target of around 260$ a share. I am also slightly on the optimistic side for tesla where other investors like the Legend Michael Burry says it could go down to below 100$ and other analysts around the 150-180$ mark. Either way, even the highest analyst rating is around a third of it's current traded price.

**Antero Resources, ticker symbol AR.**

This is a gas and oil stock. AR is currently trading at about half of it's book value of $20+. The charts show a nice set of railroad tracks with some recent drops. It appears the stock is primed to rebound. I see this stock hitting $16-$20 by the end of 2021. Right now I think it could possibly be getting ready to begin trading above the 20 day EMA again.

**Hive blockchain Technologies Ltd, ticker symbol HVBTF**

This is a blockchain play, a penny stock with some potential. It grew a little too fast in February and began to consolidate. Right now it's showing a bullish flag. I'm curious to see if this breaks out of the downward channel it has been in. [HVBTF Daily Chart](https://imgur.com/NpayK9C)

**Companhia Siderurgica Nacional 'CSN', ticker symbol SID**

This is a steel play. CSN is one of the largest steel producers in Latin America. This stock has been trading in a horizontal channel for some time. I'm watching it to see if it breaks out, or if it reverts back down to the $6 support line. [CSN Daily Chart](https://imgur.com/MkEbCNA)

**Unum Group, ticker symbol UNM**

This insurance stock has been trading in an upward channel for the past five months. It recently found support at the previous resistance level of $26. I'm watching this one to see if it can continue the trend and push up toward $30-$32. [UNM Daily Chart](https://imgur.com/diekhSI)

This post is not mine, I took/stole/borrowed/re-shared from r/FluentInFinance because I found it helpful, and wanted to share with other newer investors like myself!   


 **Original post:**

A lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this guide together on the things I look at. I updated my post from 2 months ago, to include links, and expand on some points. I'm just a regular guy who's been investing for about 19 years (with a lot of mistakes in my first 10 years), with a degree in finance/ accounting, and working in the finance field. 2021 is the year to help others, so I hope this helps.

There points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock, and where I get them from. If I am investing large amounts of cash, I want to research thoroughly, so if the stock drops I can stick to my convictions, and forget about emotion. This helps me sleep at night. At the end of the day, this is your money, and noone cares more about it than you do. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my preference. Everyone's ""recipe"" is different. Find what works for you!

&#x200B;

* **Know the company.** I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

* **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will the company scale?
* **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash flows from operations positive? How are Investing & Financing Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income Statement Trend, etc.
* **Earnings & revenue history.** Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections. Have they missed earnings? Have they beat earnings? Has earnings remained flat or grew consistently?
* **Valuations**. How is this valuated? (PEG ratio, P/E ratio). Is it undervalued? How does the valuations compare to peers or competitors in the industry?
* **Price upside/ targets & Analysts rating consensus**. I am curious about what the analysts covering a stock think it's worth. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets.
* **Charts Analysis and the technical indicators**. I am curious about what the charts have to say about momentum, and what prior prices and charting have to say about price prediction. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.
* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:** I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign
* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?
* **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock? Then is so, research why. This might be reasons to be weary.
* **Peers & competition, and competitive landscape**. How does this company stack up against its competitors and peers? How do the financials compare? How to the products compare? Is there a moat?
* **Institutional Sponsorship.** Are big banks and wall street holding this? How much or this company's stock do they hold?
* **Insider Trading**. Is the CEO buying or selling shares? Is management buying or selling shares?
* How many **ETFs** that hold this stock? Will they continue to buy it up and drive price?
* **Recent News**. I Google the company and look at recent articles. What are people saying? What are bloggers saying? What is the news saying? Any new news? Bad news? Good News? Reasons for movement in recent stock price?
* **Social sentiment**. I check what people are saying on twitter and google search trends.
* **Average volume** traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it. How large/small are the bid/ask spreads?

mh73tj,,StockMarket,post,1617200324,"I built a program that spots buzzing stocks on Reddit. Here are the results.Hey guys! I’ve built a python script that scrapes Reddit for stocks that are rapidly rising in chatter. **As you can see on my post history, my program picked up EEENF last week at $0.021. It’s now up +100%, trading at $0.045 🚀**

Here's how to interpret those figures:

* **This graph outlines the stocks that had the biggest rise in chatter over the past 3 days** (March 29 to 31) on Reddit. This increase is shown in %, from 0 to 40 (with RXM reaching a high 32%). Company logos are on the left and their tickers are inside the bars.
* **The colors represent the sentiment of the conversations around those stocks.** A deep green will indicate some highly positive chatter. A gradient green/orange will mean that the sentiment is mixed. Note: I’ve removed any stocks that had a disproportionate amount of negative sentiment. If that is something you’d like to see included in the future, please let me know.

**🧐Highlights of the Hot Stocks Report**

**💉Progressive Care (RXMD)** has its earnings call scheduled for today, which is likely why r/ pennystocks went crazy on it over the past couple of days. They are a Florida-based healthcare services company currently trading at just 1.8x their 2020 revenue ($68m market cap vs $40.6m revenue).

**🚁The German eVTOL company, Lilium,** announced it will be going public through SPAC, with QELL. Reddit seems mixed about it, with the biggest bear argument being that they don’t have a functional product (fair enough 😁). Joby seems to be ahead of the race for now with its working prototype and test flights. It’s a very exciting space but still at an extremely early stage so be wary of high valuations.

**☀️Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (ASTI),** a developer and manufacturer of lightweight and flexible thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions announced on Tuesday that the company could receive significant support as part of H.R. 133, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, specifically potential allocation of the Department of Energy (“DOE”) Research and Development (R&D) Funding for the type of innovative, US-made PV technology that Ascent manufactures for the Space, Aerospace, Defense, Disaster Recovery, and Transportation sectors.

The SPY briefly reached record intraday levels. Market participants continue to monitor rising Treasury yields and digested President Biden’s newly proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill, which could include changes to existing tax policy. Today marks the final session of Q1 of 2021. 

Ahead of President Biden’s address later today, the White House revealed a new, massive infrastructure proposal. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).

Today marks the final session of an extremely volatile quarter. Year-to-date, cyclical, energy, financial, industrial and reopening stocks have strongly outperformed tech and high-growth stocks that led the market higher last year. As the pace of vaccinations increases (roughly 3 million doses distributed per day in the US), it seems market participants have been rotating to stocks poised to benefit from the gradual reopening of the economy. 

Despite signs of economic improvement, market participants are concerned that the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, combined with massive fiscal spending, may cause an unwanted rise in inflation, reinforced by the recent climb in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (1.735% at the time of writing). Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

You should not trade options unless you're convinced you're smarter and know more about the market than the average professional.

That said, your brokerage don't want to tell you no just because you're gonna lose your money; they're wanting to give the correct amount of access for the amount of money you have to lose. And they want to make sure you're just an idiot, but not mentally handicapped. They don't want your family to sue them to get the money back after you lose it, basically.

[Repo market. Always something with the repo market these days ... : HoleyProfit (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/mhnv94/repo_market_always_something_with_the_repo_market/)

&#x200B;

TLDR; Spikes in repo overnight lending rates may imply lenders are worried about the solvency of borrowers, even over a short period of hours. Since these borrowers are big important institutions, their insolvency risk would be bad, if that was what was happening.

&#x200B;

**Margin calls and counter party risk with derivative products**

[So - Them Derivatives. : HoleyProfit (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/mhk7ls/so_them_derivatives/)

TLDR; Leveraged derivative bets have led to big margin calls. The margin call has been defaulted on. Since the bet is leveraged the 6 billion bet has a 20 billion loss. This is causing counter party issues and block selling in the underlying assets.

&#x200B;

**The shorting of the bond market. (Implied by negative rates in the repo market).**

[Are there big shorts in the bond market? : HoleyProfit (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/m8qt3r/are_there_big_shorts_in_the_bond_market/)

TLDR: There seems to be heavy shorting of the bond markets. This would imply someone is betting against the Fed keeping rates low [as recently announced](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/m7gxon/big_price_moves_today_full_market_round_up/). If this bet is incorrect one of the results of it will probably be a bubble (Very big rise in value) of the USD. Which can cause a lot of instability in the markets.

&#x200B;

**Dalio's warning of a depression**

[Dario's warning : HoleyProfit (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/m5blge/darios_warning/)

TLDR: Dalio explains how the pattern of how debt burdens build up. Need to be deleveraged and the risks that come with deleveraging. In his analysis he compares the US of today with the US of 1929 (Heading into the depression) and Japan of 1990 (Heading into their depression). He says these cycles complete about every 90 to 100 years. And it's been about that since it happened in the US.

&#x200B;

**Burry's ETF bubble thesis**

[Why the Russel 200 index has now become my main interest in indices short opportunities. : HoleyProfit (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/m44zmb/why_the_russel_200_index_has_now_become_my_main/)

TLDR: Burry says passive investing has led to a lack of analysis in stocks which has caused a huge bubble. He further says derivatives on these stocks are much bigger than the real market for them. If there is panic in the market these positions will not be able to be closed and swell up to insane dollar value losses, and this is the same underlying principle that caused the 2008 crisis.

mhntv3,,StockMarket,post,1617252449,"Angled Ioniq 5 vs elegant EV6 The EV6 and Ioniq 5 standard models are equipped with electric motors of the same specifications. The standard trim 2WD model has a 125kW electric motor mounted on the rear axle, and the 4WD model has a combined output of 173kW with motors mounted on the front and rear axles respectively. ​ The difference in performance between the two vehicles is from the long-range model. Ioniq 5 Long Range 2WD is equipped with 160kW and 4WD is equipped with 225kW electric motors, while EV6 Long Range is equipped with 2WD 168kW and 4WD 239kW. ​ Moreover, the EV6 is also equipped with a high-performance GT model. The EV6 GT is only available for all-wheel drive models and has a maximum output of 430kW (about 584 horsepower) and a maximum torque of 740Nm (about 75.5kgf·m). It reaches 100 km/h from standstill in just 3.5 seconds, and the top speed is limited to 260 km/h. This is the fastest acceleration ability among all-time domestic cars. ​ As the EV6 GT aims for high performance, it is equipped with a software-based electronic differential limiting function (e-LSD), electronic control suspension (ECS), 21-inch performance wheels & tires, and large-capacity disc brakes to provide excellent performance even in extreme driving situations. It is added to increase the enjoyment of driving.

mhcyej,,StockMarket,post,1617216830,"The Uranium Bull Thesis Is Playing Out To Perfection. A $500bn Market Is Emerging. A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable!With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the uranium market, focusing a bit on SWU, which I am very fond of haha. As always, I look forward to any feedback.  

As am sure all are aware, last week saw an uptick in uranium spot from $27 to \~$30. While the increase was in large part to DNN and UEC’s physical purchasing, I noticed a number of discussions on Reddit (not on this sub, thankfully) and various Discord servers, StockTwits also, seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot U was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle.

Experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Rather, a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the SWU enrichment price.

Based in large part on SWU projections, many expert investors are forecasting a $500bn market. For perspective, during the last cycle, the market peaked at \~$150bn.

***So... what is SWU?***

For those very new to uranium investing, a very quick overview might be helpful. Also, for those more familiar than I am, I appreciate the feedback.

SWU (short for Separative Work Unit) is a measure for the cost of enrichment. Generally speaking, when SWU prices are low, utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries (i.e., Kerry trades).

Conversely, a rise in SWU signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing. As excess inventories are utilized by end users, the utilities (no longer aided by the secondary market) instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices. It follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle; from conversion (UF6) and even fabricated fuel purchasing, to the beginning (i.e. spot U308), which in turn drives those spot prices up.

Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, higher SWU prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online. McArthur and Cigar Lake, for example, need at least the $40's, and for Paladin, likely in the $50s in order to justify their operational costs.

Therefore, **SWU is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle**.

Even when there are false starts/spikes in the market (which we’ve seen in the past couple years), SWU price is consistent.

***What is the current SWU price?***

SWU bottomed out at $\~34 in August 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following Fukushima.

Since hitting that low, SWU has been on a relative straight line upwards, currently estimated at \~$54. This steady growth over the past 2.5 years is one of, if not the most, compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector.

***So... how the \*\*\*\* is SWU forecasting a $500bn market?!***

Of course, there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing. It's becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging (i.e., breaking news this week on Green energy qualifications, allowing uranium to fit into an ESG basket, etc.).

However, more-so than anything SWU is at the core of the bull thesis, which is, that ***decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power*** (Duke Energy Corp. just said the same yesterday...)

As SWU prices continue to rise, **it is inevitable that equity prices will follow**.  Denison Mines ($DNN) is a fun example to think about.

Even now , I'm still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of $DNN are surprised when they hear that Denison isn't actually producing any uranium. When utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at SWU in the $60s, $70s, $80s, and beyond, $DNN will turn the lights back on. The fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts. It won't be long before $DNN prices start to rise. The same idea goes with Cominak, Ranger, etc.

Moreover, what happens when we've exhausted Cigar Lake and Kazatomprom? Or McArthur River? 

It isn't just that we have a rising demand, we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 2025-2030. The investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting. 

***And why $500bn***? 

Frankly, I think $500bn is conservative, though something in this vicinity I have seen as the consensus among many experts. Ultimately, there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity (i.e., hedge funds), and they are looking for value. Taking $URNM as one example, the AUM just months ago when it IPO'd was a few million. Now AUM is $175mm. We also cannot ignore what is happening in China. It is a huge growth story there. There is also a SPEC frenzy.  

But again, looking at the big picture, more-so than anything else, I keep going back to SWU. For me, it is the most powerful predictor of the multi-year bull run to come. And while there will always be doubtful retail who, to their credit, have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years, you cannot deny what 2.5 years of rising SWU enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle.

Again, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree. Any and all feedback is appreciated!",['DUK']

They also organise regular strikes which cause a massive disruption and blackmail city to get more pay (they are already paid above and beyond what average person with similar qualifications normally earns). 

Another strike has been called, when some of the staff sitting down and doing mainly nothing, was offered redundancies as they were being replaced with automated ticket machines. Again union was appalled. Despite the fact that most staff has little or nothing to do nowadays as tickets are no longer required, information can be obtained on the mobile, the union would like for the company to continue their full-time employment and all benefits. 

I appreciate the need for union in sectors where worker lives can be at risk, if you work on oil-rig yes you need all protection you can get and you don't want your employer to skimp on it.

 [ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/quote), [American Beacon ARK Transfmt Innov A (ADNAX)](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/adnax/quote)

Thematic-investing specialist ARK Investment Management has been in tune with the market’s unfolding narrative in recent years, but its lone portfolio manager, inexperienced team, and lax risk controls make it ill-prepared to grapple with a major plot twist. Its flagship strategy, ARK Innovation ([ARKK](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/quote)), earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Neutral.

## The Pitch and the Niche

ARK believes that equity indexes are full of value traps in danger of technological obsolescence and that traditional asset managers hew too closely to their benchmarks, thereby loading themselves up with stocks in [doomed industries](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ArkInvest_101420_Whitepaper_BadIdeas2020.pdf). Its solution is to invest across five technology platforms--artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics--that it thinks will revolutionize how economic sectors across the globe operate.

True to form, the firm’s products look unlike any index. The portfolio of its flagship strategy, ARK Innovation, is top-heavy, makes huge industry bets, and has historically invested in publicly traded companies of virtually every size. It embraces money-losing companies so long as they’re aggressively investing to exceed their already high growth expectations.

The firm defines success differently from most long-only funds. Rather than aim to outperform an index, the firm cares most about achieving high returns and invests only in companies it thinks will gain 15% or more annualized over the next five years. That hurdle is roughly double the annualized return of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index (the fund’s category benchmark) since 2000.

The firm’s etf lineup has done far better than that. Its flagship strategy, which combines ideas expressed in its six other actively managed ETFs, gained 150% in 2020. A flood of inflows followed. Over the 12 months through February 2021, the firm’s total assets under management leapt to roughly $80 billion from less than $12 billion.

The firm is shareholder-friendly in some ways. It has developed its product lineup thoughtfully by maintaining its focus on the handful of innovation platforms and underlying technologies it thinks have longevity. Its ETFs are cost-competitive relative to actively managed rivals.

But few features of its research team or process suggest ARK Innovation will continue to beat the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index on a risk-adjusted basis.

## The Key Person

ARK’s main draw is its founder, chief executive officer, and portfolio manager Cathie Wood, who, after more than three decades in the industry, launched the firm in 2014.

## MORE ON THIS TOPIC

* [**No Room on the ARK?**](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682/no-room-on-the-ark)

She honed her thematic-oriented process at AllianceBernstein from 2001 to 2013, where she ran several strategies similar to this one that had high volatility, poor downside performance, and underwhelming long-term results during her tenure. During her 12 years at the helm of large-growth separate account AB MA Strategic Research, its before-fee total returns comfortably outpaced the Russell 1000 Growth Index *but lagged on a risk-adjusted basis*. She also managed two growth-oriented mutual funds--one focused on domestic mid-caps, the other on global stocks--whose net-of-fee results underperformed their bogies on her watch, risk-adjusted or otherwise.

And yet, as ARK’s primary investment decision-maker who has established a ubiquitous media presence and enthusiastic following, Wood is essential to the firm’s continued success. Director of research Brett Winton would likely succeed her if needed, but his nearly 15 years of industry experience include none as a portfolio manager. Exacerbating that key-person risk is the firm’s inability to develop and retain talent: Many of the analysts supporting the funds’ research have come and gone, and most of the remaining nine lack deep industry experience.

## Not Your Typical Analyst Team

The firm’s analyst bench is [distinct](https://ark-invest.com/the-ark-difference/) from traditional asset managers, but not in a good way. The typical equity research analyst in the asset management industry has a predictable set of credentials: an undergraduate degree from a name-brand institution, some entry-level work experience, an MBA, an analytical internship, and at least some progress toward investment-related credentials, such as becoming a CFA charterholder. Almost none of ARK's analysts have progress beyond earning bachelor's degrees.

Indeed, ARK’s research-related job postings [tend not](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Job_Positions/Job_Opportunity_Analyst-Fintech.pdf) to demand credentials of any kind. That sort of openness expands the applicant pool and invites individuals of various backgrounds and experiences to submit their resumes. The firm may be on to something there. Cognitively diverse teams can be more creative or innovative than those without a variety of perspectives. (1)

But this team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

## Crowdsourcing

ARK outsources much of the technical expertise to “[theme developers](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARK-Invest-Thematic-Investment-Process.pdf)”--some of whom the firm says are academics, entrepreneurs, and former ARK analysts--who donate their time. It also invites feedback on its research and new investment ideas from individuals following the firm through social media. These features make the firm’s process of gathering and digesting information unique, but its analytical edge remains unclear in an industry that provides (for a fee) subject-matter experts to advise shops that lack requisite technical know-how.

## A Peculiar Analyst Coverage Model

Wood [thinks](https://youtu.be/-hnK2cEvbJg?t=350) other asset managers set up their analyst teams poorly to comprehend the potential impact of these technologies on the economy. Rather than assigning analysts coverage of economic sectors--a common industry practice that Wood thinks creates information silos--ARK assigns them one or more technological specialties. For example, [one](https://ark-invest.com/our-team/) analyst covers energy storage, robotics, and reusable rockets; another covers automation, robotics, energy storage, alternate energy, and space exploration.

Wood has a point. Technology is crucial to both its purveyors and consumers and influences the sales and expenses of companies across all industries. It follows that analysts who can accurately forecast the accessibility, cost declines, and adoption rates of the most promising innovations could have a stock-picking advantage. But her views on this don’t radically diverge from her competitors. Many recognize the downsides of industry specialization and try to mitigate them by fostering collaboration across sectors or implementing a generalist approach.

In some ways, ARK’s setup could lead to ultra-specialization and potential blind spots that better resourced firms wouldn’t miss. For example, it assigns DNA sequencing, genome editing, and immunotherapy to two analysts who are early in their careers and at a disadvantage to their healthcare-focused rivals. The teams of other shops collaborate to cover biotech, pharma, and life-sciences firms in breadth and depth and staff their teams with seasoned analysts holding doctorates or other advanced degrees in medicine, biology, or neuroscience.

## Unrestrained, Unaware, and Unconcerned

ARK Innovation’s benchmark agnosticism and high return targets saddle the portfolio with risks that Wood manages mainly with instinct rather than data or rules. The firm, which has no risk management personnel, views the subject almost exclusively through the lens of its scoring system that monitors six inputs to a stock’s investment thesis. They are:

1) Company, People, and Culture  
2) Execution  
3) Moats: Barriers to Entry  
4) Product Leadership  
5) Valuation  
6) Thesis Risk

These form the basis of levelheaded bottom-up research--most investment teams use some variation of them--but they provide little visibility into the portfolio’s aggregate risk exposures.

Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another. There [is potential](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARKInvest_052720_whitepaper_Innovation-Allocation.pdf) for diversification across innovation platforms--but the firm’s self-categorization of its investable universe does not by itself imply a rigorous understanding of which stocks are likely to rise, fall, succeed, and fail together. Forward-looking estimates of the holdings’ correlations and variances or other input from a separate risk-management team, on the other hand, would do more. (2)

Such analysis is complex and nonessential for most of this strategy’s rivals. That’s because the typical long-only equity strategy defines its risk limit and stays within it, for example, by anchoring its sector weights to prevent extreme sector concentration. ARK has few portfolio construction parameters. It has said it will generally invest no more than around 10% of ARK Innovation’s assets in a single company (it has adhered to this guidance) and no more than half of ARK Innovation’s assets in a single technology.

To be sure, ARK makes no promise to diversify its portfolios, and it [tells investors](https://youtu.be/Qb8uQSQi8bc?t=396) to expect volatility. But even a high-octane strategy like this one should be cognizant of the risks embedded in its portfolio and manage to a definable risk tolerance. It seems not to. Indeed, on March 29, 2021, the fund removed prospectus language limiting the size of its top positions and its ownership percentage of individual companies’ shares outstanding.

## Blind to the Future

The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

The firm has [minimized](https://ark-funds.com/innovation-webinar-series/capacity-and-liquidity-analysis) the notion that the ETF’s *downside has become steeper*, mostly by relying on the past as a guide to the future. But its heft is new, and future market crises will be different from previous ones. Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline.

Other potential consequences of the strategy's size are less dire but hinder its ability to exploit good ideas and oust bad ones. Nimble execution is now tougher than before. To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position. (2)

## Reasonable Doubts

ARK’s pursuit of disruptive innovators has merit, and its quest for big rewards may appeal to aggressive investors who can stomach the risk of potentially heavy losses. But ARK’s team of inexperienced analysts, go-with-your-gut risk management approach, and bloated asset base raise doubts about whether this fund’s outstanding historical results can continue.

Wikisoft’s flagship online platform, **Wikiprofile.com**, aims to be a powerful solution with tools and resources for businesses and business professionals to find valid information quickly and easily so that they can make informed career and hiring decisions.

By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, Wikisoft seeks to process raw data elements and refine them into tangible and valuable insights for businesses and business professionals.

They believe, In line with increasing globalization, that there is a growing demand for access to credible company and employee information worldwide.  
Despite the fact that Wikisoft's (**WSFT:US**) business directory system capitalizes on the freemium subscription-based version to use a service that far goes beyond the offerings provided by competitors such as LinkedIn and also Glassdoor.

Let´s compare Wikisoft, which is a relatively new company, with its peers and what they have accomplished:

Hired raised **132$ million** since founding in 2012. More than 10,000 of the top companies using Hired and can save significant time screening their candidates. In fact it is claimed that it **reduces the time to hire by 33%!**

Glassdoor, founded in 2008 was acquired by Recruit Holdings for **1.2$ billion** in May 2018. Provides recruiting solutions to over 7,000 employers – including 40% of the Fortune 500 companies.

Last but not least, LinkedIn (established in 2005) was acquired by Microsoft for a staggering **26.2$ billion**. It is estimated that their channel sales consist of 3.4$ billion Talent solutions, 1$ billion Marketing solutions and 1.3$ billion subscriptions.

With companies in their growth phase, it is important to gather a lot of cash. This can be best done with dilution of shares. Wikisoft has filed a listing on the OTC stock exchange exactly for this reason.

The New York State Senate Tuesday evening approved a bill that would legalize marijuana for recreational use by a vote of 40-23.
The bill, the Marijuana and Taxation Act, is expected to easily pass the State Assembly.
Although Gov. Andrew Cuomo (Dem.) has said he will sign the legislation and cannabis legalization would then become legal immediately, marijuana sales in stores would take 18 months to two years to start, according to State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes.
Cuomo's office has said that once fully implemented, marijuana legalization is expected to rake in $350M annually in tax revenue.

The end of the week is lining up to be and explosive trend day up but today seems to be a blah day waiting on news. Boundaries have been set on both sides so let's see what breaks first. Today's possible outcomes are as follows: 1) Range day structure with consolidation between 395 and 393 area before breaking higher or lower. 2) Break above 395 area for a lopsided range day which opens a path to 400. 3) we hold 395 resistance area and break thru the 393-support area with a retest target of 390. 

1) Range day structure with consolidation between 395 and 393 area before breaking higher or lower. **40% probability** 

2) Break above 395 area for a lopsided range day which opens a path to 400. **35% probability** 

3) we hold 395 resistance area and break thru the 393-support area with a retest target of 390. **25% probability**",

Part of my reason for the question is that, imo, AMD is getting ready for their best ever ER.

That being said, two things to keep in mind:
1) Any underlying that you sell a CSP on should be an underlying which you feel comfortable taking ownership of, as eventually positions will move against you and you run the risk of assignment.  In this way choose something which is fundamentally a good company, with good options liquidity, and a general steady upward trend.  You can also look at playing for IV crush.
2) There is not proof that, over the long term, active options trading beats a passive index fund/dividend based portfolio.  In fact, over a long enough timeframe, index funds win.  So, while you may be getting regular “income” from this strategy, keep in mind you probably will be making less (unrealized gains) than if you just tossed it all into an index fund.

HENC Projects Multi-Billion Dollar Cannabis Operation in Michigan; Revenue Analysis of Multi-Phase Cultivation Plan Shows $3 billion Upside Potential in Annual Retail Value

**DOVER, DE / ACCESSWIRE / March 31, 2021 /** Hero Technologies (OTC PINK:HENC;), a cannabis company focused on a ""seed-to-sale"" vertical integration strategy, today announced that its subsidiary, BlackBox Systems and Technologies LLC, has produced detailed cost, revenue, and profit projections for cannabis production on the 120-acre property in Jackson, Michigan the company plans to purchase.

The company's plans for the property include building state-of-the-art sun chambers-high-technology greenhouses that produce cost-effective, high-yield cannabis all year round-and cultivating cannabis in hoop houses. The Michigan property supports up to 500 sun chambers, where each sun chamber of which can potentially generate between $5 million and $10 million annually in high-margin revenue.

The company's financial projections detail eight phases of cannabis cultivation development. Depending on the mix of wholesale and retail sales, as well as cannabis price fluctuations, the company expects to generate between $15 million and $38 million in annual revenue during the initial pilot phase, growing quickly to over $100 million in phase III. The initial pilot phase is expected to cost approximately $6.5 million to complete. By the final phase of development, the company calculates it can produce an annual cannabis crop of approximately of $1.5 billion in the wholesale market or a retail value of $3 billion in annual sales. The company's goal for the Blackbox project is to become a super-regional cannabis cultivation hub in the Midwest.

""The numbers for our cannabis cultivation plan in Michigan look exceptionally strong,"" said Hero Technologies' CEO Gina Serkasevich. ""We have thoroughly analyzed startup costs, ongoing costs, and a wide range of revenue scenarios. Even our most conservative estimates, using the low end of the wholesale price range, put us over $1 billion in revenue by the end of our multi-phase plan. And the upside potential is much bigger. A higher percentage of retail sales and a higher price per pound could support annual revenue from our Michigan operations in excess of $3 billion."" The company believes it will take five to ten years to reach its master plan for the Jackson, Michigan property. According to greenentrepreneur.com the medical market alone in Michigan is expected to reach $3 billion in sales in coming years.

Does anyone else just want to puke when they see their commercial on CNBC for Follow the Smart Money?

If you haven't seen it, here's their strategy in a nutshell: 

Imagine you're in middle school, and there's a quiz in Zoology class today. Zoology is taught at different periods throughout the day, every kid in the grade will take the quiz at some point throughout the day. Everyone's known about the quiz for weeks, and most kids have studied and are prepared. Not Pete and Jon, they haven't studied shit. They have a different strategy to pass the quiz. 

Luckily for them, Pete and Jon have Zoology during 6th period, late in the day after many kids have already taken the quiz. So, Pete and Jon ask as many people at Recess as they can, what their answers were. They have no idea who the smart kids are, but there is a really loud kid who is POSITIVE he got the right answer. Pete and Jon don't know if this kid is smart or dumb, but they do know he's very convicted about being right. So, they decide to listen to this loud kid and use his answers when they take the test.

That's their strategy: copy the loud kid. Not sit next to the smartest kid in class and cheat off his/her paper, just listen to the loud kid at recess and use his answers. Follow the Loud Kid.

In their real world applications of this strategy, they monitor options chains and wait to see a volume spike in a particular order. They have no idea who is making the trade, it could be the smartest trader in the world, a hedge fund covering a position or some drunken billionaire letting his pet monkey pick his next stock trade. They see that high volume trade and then they copy it. That's it. ""Oh look, Jon, someone just bought 1000 ROKU June 350 Calls. That's a lot, let's buy those too. Good thinking, Pete."" The end, that's what they do.

The broader market finished lower following another volatile session, but interestingly, many individual stocks that were beaten down in recent weeks surged. Market participants continue to digest the sudden unwinding in stocks by a large hedge fund and an elevated Treasury yield.

Yesterday, Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the fear stemming from Archegos’ margin call, new data shows encouraging signs that the economy is recovering.  In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

However, concerns from market participants remained centered on the pace of economic recovery. With the recent passage of more stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future may cause a rapid spike in inflation.

As you may or may not have seen, these new filings have been submitted to the SEC and there has been some discussion on there real impact and effect.

NSCC-2021-103

NSCC-2021-104

NSCC-2021-801


Simply put, these are beyond me and most other average people to interpret. 
There is the assumption that these relate heavily to the current issues with hedge funds, either just Archegos or further to the industry in general. 
Really my only question is to anyone that is able to read, interpret and understand the implications of these filings once they come into effect, what it will change and where it will leave us.

So I'm not that much of a noob when it comes to the general stock market but i'm planning to short some stocks and that opens up to a whole new world for me, which leads to a ton of noob questions. I hope someone could help shine some light. Very much appreciate it!  


I understand to short sell stocks i got to use a margin account, and I applied one in webull. Here comes the question, say I have $10000 in my account, and I want to short a stock (day trade only, not holding overnight), the stock has a maintenance requirement of 200%, does that mean that if I short $2000 worth of stock, I gotta have at least $2000x200% = $4000 of cash sitting in my account untouched?  


I did contact Webull with this exact question, they said the $2000 I shorted the stock for does not count as use of margin.  


I'm super confused. Shorting a stock meaning borrowing stock from the broker, I thought it should count as use of margin, I really need clarification on this.  


If the above scenario doesn't count as margin, does that mean that only if I short a stock using leverage would count as margin?  


Really appreciate it guys!

I recently sold a call option on DBX, which I own 100 shares of.  The bid was .28, and that's what I sold it for. Immediately I had $28.00 deposited into my balance. But when I look at my call option positions now, it says gain is $5.00. Does that mean since the price of the stock went down, the option premium is only worth $5.00 now, not the $28.00?

I thought when you sold an option, you collected the premium at the time of sell, not on the position changing it's price?  If it hits the strike price it sells I know, but I thought the premium was a set amount you collect.  I appreciate any advice on this I'm still trying to grasp it",
mgp1y0,gsu9kj5,StockMarket,comment,1617136007,"If the gain is $5, it’s likely that the price of the call went down to $.23 due to the stock’s fallen price. If you wanted to use your premium to buy the same exact call, you could net 0 your position by buying the same strike and expiration call for $.23 per stock or $23. Remember the most you can gain from the sold call is $28, the total premium if the contract expires worthless.",

mgszr4,,StockMarket,post,1617147350,"$CBD files Form 6-K for share capital increase, but no change in number of shares?Looking for wiser folks than I to help me understand the impact of this move. 

*Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao ($CBD)*, has filed Form 6-K with the SEC. They are seeking a shareholder vote on the approval of a share capital increase in the amount of R$ 200.000.000,00 (approx. 35 mil US$) through the capitalization of part of the Expansion Reserve account, **without the issuance of new shares**, passing the capital from R$ 5,649,866,585.69 to R$ 5,849,866,585.69, **with no change in the number of shares.** 

I understood that standard practice when raising capital is to issue new shares, thereby diluting the overall share poll and likely lowering their value. However, here they appear to be drawing funds from a reserve account to directly increase their capitalization. If there are no new shares, would this have any impact on the shares I currently hold? Thanks.

mhcmi4,,wallstreetbets,post,1617215909,"DD: Gamestop Price Analysis -- still a Deep Fucking Value under $550**TLDR;** Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven’t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.

Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don’t worry my fellow ape brethren I’ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let’s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop’s transition.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

# Chapter 1: Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online.

Let’s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431

And this is the key misstep the HF’s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They’ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can’t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it’s expensive). They can’t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn’t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it’s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn’t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.

Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.

# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth

It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092

So what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he’s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy’s online sales figures under Cohen to project what’s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e

That’s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.

Gamestop Announced in it’s Q4 earnings report last week what it’s intentions are... *“Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.”*

Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...

&#x200B;

# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales

If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it’s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon’s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723

Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it’s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon’s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn’t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.

So let’s get to the fun part… valuation

&#x200B;

# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?

Valuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I’ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.

Gamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)… we’re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let’s look at the figures anyway and then I’ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it’s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm… why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop’s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now… it would move it’s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That’s not a squeeze number. That’s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f

So let’s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I’ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you’ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it’s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You’ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it’s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it’s online business, it’s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.

&#x200B;

# Final Chapter: Conclusions

Ok you’ve been patient, and I told you I’d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn’t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it’s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?

Well **$191**, that’s what it’s trading at. It’s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don’t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn’t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It’s because of quality, and support for the brand.

Lots of things are increasing Gamestop’s valuation, but growth of it’s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I’m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop’s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is… an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.

Project these figures onto Gamestop as you’d like. I’ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it’s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it’s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it’s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years… Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you’re wondering how that’s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another…

I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).

Here is a teaser… When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it’s price north of $31,800 on it’s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).

If you needed one more reason to HODL, it’s this… you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife’s boyfriend lost your password couldn’t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.

And if you’ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects… I think I figured it out

Please Be Good To Each Other Out There.

Behind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. **If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that.**

Don’t lose who you are in the wealth that may (or maybe not) suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances. I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes. Let’s make the world a better place.

Not financial advice.

I don’t know how the stock market works.

I don’t know how companies or their fundamentals work.

**I bashed the keyboard a bunch of times and this popped out.**

The only thing I know for certain, is I bake a mean crayon pie.

mhl9mg,,wallstreetbets,post,1617242834,"Why Has There Been Two Days Of $100+ Billion In Reverse Repo Operations?Over the last few days, there has been a crazy surge in same day reverse repo operations at the NY Fed.

What are these Reverse Repos you ask, and I ask too BTW, but according to the NY Fed:

*""  The New York  Fed conducts repo and reverse repo operations each day as  a  means to help keep  the federal funds rate in the target range set  by  the* [*Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC)*](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)*.  ""*

So large banks and institutions can exchange with the Fed money to help control the money supply. **Gotcha.**

Ok, and to see how much has been traded recently:

Honestly,  I came across something online citing  and wanted to see what others  thought. Steven Van Metre, Bond King from his videos, comments as it being too much cash in  circulation, though also in the same video cites a tweet about the IMO  saying there is a global shortage of the US dollar?

And  I understand that with the SLR exemption expiring, banks need to lower  their capital, however I don't think (I don't think alot actually  regardless) that lending the Fed billions overnight would actually help  banks comply.

Or is this in anyway linked to the shit going down with over leverage?

**TLDR:**

* Wrinkled Brain Apes, why are institutions exchanging CRAZY amounts with the FED to borrow treasury notes overnight?
* And why would Institutions WANT to trade billions for short term loans of treasury notes?

Edit: [ELI5 Thread With Excellent Comments Explaining Why This Can Happen At End of Quarter To Help Banks Pay Taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/d64tie/eli5_repo_rates_how_they_work_and_what_the_heck/)

\- Some comments also seem to imply that when Banks get worried about the market they do this to shift into more secure investments.

\- Another possibility I've read is that Banks will purchase a shit ton of Bonds before the quarter ends to make their balance sheets look WAY safer than it actually is...

\- Finding some stuff on the Overnight Repo Issues of Sept 2019 when the rate spiked up to 10%, but overnight repo rates currently have been flat (0.05 as of last Friday)

\- Repo Market depends pretty much on 4 banks (BoA, Citi, JPMorgan,WF) and liquidity issues back in Sept 2019 caused a fuss because of the Liquidity Rule and banks not having enough cash to follow the rule and to lend out, so the repo rate shot up back then.

\- Other theory I've read, Banks are fighting with FED, as always, and want the Liquidity Rule raised and the FED wants to sell bonds to pay for stimmies and Biden's infrastructure. Banks use the borrowed T-Notes to keep bond interest down so no one wants to buy government bonds. Not sure if this summation is correct, but it would be similar to Banks shorting the bond market.

\-- Yep, this is looking more and more like the case, but even weirder with Banks loaning HF's money and negative interest rates to get more treasurey notes, still reading more on this one....

\--> If Bond interest rates keep going up, then prices for them will go down. If Banks buy up treasuries and then sell them on the treasury market, they can buy them back at a later date after interest rates have risen, AT A LOWER PRICE, banks keep the difference, BUT if there's a shortage of TNotes, OR if interest rates start falling again, Banks have to buy them back at higher prices, which....  ------> This is gonna need a whole new post, this is getting DEEP.

mheku0,,wallstreetbets,post,1617221433,"Why Bill Hwang got margin called**TLDR:** >!Bill Hwang got margin called because he immediately reinvested his money. How? Read the article you retard.!<

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advise and I'm not a financial advisor. In fact, as this is of one of my first articles here, don't shoot me immediately unless it's to the moon! Tho I'd love some feedback from you all, I'd love even more that you do your own DD and analyses.

&#x200B;

Hi fellow apes and retards, 

&#x200B;

So if you've all followed the news, or even the daily charts here on Reddit, you've read that Bill Hwang has received a margin call of several billions, probably the largest margin call ever seen. In this article, I'd like to connect the dots for you guys on that call.

&#x200B;

**Bill Hwang** has made an incredible fortune on Wall Street. With Archegos Capital Management (ACM), he and a lot of employees are trading nonstop to achieve financial freedom, about a million times financial freedom. To many of us is that a dream, some are on their way, others are starting their journey to what Bill Hwang has accomplished. My reason for this article is that **we all can make the same mistakes as mr Hwang did**, although it will be one of a smaller size, it's impact on our lives can be just as large as it is to Bills. We should learn from him.

**So why does he even get margin called? He's got a fortune, right?** Well yeah, he does. Or actually, he does, but he's also got a bazillion of leverage. Basically, what Bill did, is he got a $600 share for about $100 of his own money, the other $500 was a loan. Unlike what some say, loans are okay, every major company has loans, and they are able to borrow money because they have assets.

The same goes with ACM and Bill Hwang. As they bought something worth $600 with $600, that's fine you would say. Except he didn't actually buy it. Bloomberg reported that Bill was trading in swap stocks and leveraged **contracts for difference, or CFDs**. These are legal in Europe, not anymore in the US. a CFD is basically agreeing to deposit $600, with the same price flow as Stock X, and when it goes to $800, you get the difference in your bank account **immediately**. 

One of the most quotes here on reddit, and especially in the much volatile GME thread, is: **You only lose when you sell.** But in the case of Bill Hwang and CFDs, that is actually **false** because he doesn't buy any asset, he deposits money that replicates the same price movement as an asset. And still, that's okay, even when leveraged, that's okay, because it allowes to replicate a $600 stock with just $100, and when it goes to $800, you have $200 extra in your account. 

Now let's say we got another example. In this case, We have stock B that is currently trading at a $100 price. Bill has got $100, so he would buy 1 CFD. But when he leverages this with $500, he's now able to buy 6 CFDs. If the price of stock B moves to $150, he would not have $50 in profit, but now, **6 times as much**, which makes $300! The value of the CFDs is now 6 x $150 = $900, $500 being borrowed, $100 initial deposit, and $300 profit.

Bill came up with a great plan. He's got the $300 immediately in his account. Stock B trades at $150 and Bill expect it to rise even more. So bill takes his $300 profit, and of buying 2 stocks, he leverages it with the same 5:1 ratio and get about $1500 in leverage. Now, he's able to buy 12 more CFDs of $150 each. **Bill has only invested $400 of his own money, but owns 18 CFDs, worth $2700!** 

Now here's comes scary part. Bill doesn't own a stock asset at all. He has something that replicates the movement of a stock. It may well be that the price goes down, even tho Bill has great interest in the stock. **As Bill didn't buy any stock, but a CFD, the price doesn't move up or down by Bill's moves.**

As he doesn't own the stock, the underlying asset is.... (surprise)... **his bank account**! And in that bank account is $2000 leveraged, $100 initial deposit, $300 in profit. That's only $2400. You ask where the rest is? There is no other $300. It is leveraged profit from the first 6 CFDs. 

Now let's say the price goes down from $150 to a price of $125 per stock B. That means his 18 CFDs decrease $25 each, **he's lost a whopping $450.** Bill's only got $125 x 18 CFDs = $2250 now. And that's also okay, because he borrowed $2000 and invested $100 initially. He's got $150 in total profit, still. Please note: this gets immediately charged on this bank account value, because as profits do, losses do too.

But what happens when the price goes to, let's say, back to $100? His underlying asset, his bank account, is only valued at 18 CFDs worth $1800 in total. It starts getting tricky because the bank wants their $2000 back. **The profit and initial deposit have vanished.**

At a certain, pre-defined point, the bank does not want to take more risk of losing the $2000 loan because Bill is nearly broke. As the price goes to about $50, 18 CFD value at $900, Bill needs to pay a lot back and he hasn't got any assets supporting him and eventually leads to a predefined margin call. This can be tackled by diversification, but as we saw in the tech stocks, if a full sector or even multiple sectors decrease, this gets tricky.

 That's why profits can be great, but continuous reinvesting of profits can make a slippery slope.",

Now I believe they are getting ready to join the S&P 500 as the company has met almost all of the criteria.

The criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500:

&#x200B;

* The company should be from the U.S. ✔️
* Its market cap must be at least $11.8B ✔️
* Its shares must be highly liquid ✔️
* 4 profitable quarters (Almost there)
* Have a public float of at least 10% of its shares outstanding (almost there)

RKT meets all of the points above except the last two. Dan Gilbert is the largest investor and owns most of the shares, 95% until recently. Today him and his wife sold 40M and now owns approx. 93% of shares outstanding. Once he sells enough to get to 90% of shares we should qualify for the S&P.

mhlrlw,,wallstreetbets,post,1617244628,"[$VIACA] Ultimate Rebound PotentialTL;DR: VIAC**A** has the potential to 2x/3x in a similar fashion to DISC**B**.

ViacomCBS (VIAC, VIACA) and Discover (DISCA, DISCB) have taken a beating, driven by share dilution and the  *Archegos* Capital Management liquidation fiasco. The majority of the sell pressure was not organic, but driven by Billions of dollars in block trades that were executed on Friday 3/26.

Fast forward to this morning, DISCB rebounded and closed with a 83% INCREASE...and was up over 100% at one point today. Trading was so volatile that it was halted **10x** today: [https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts)

Now why is this important for VIACA? Lets look at Discovery Class A vs. Class B shares...and what happened.

ViacomCBS and Discovery Class A shares were the ones block traded due to the **Archegos Capital Management** [margin call-related liquidation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/discoverys-class-b-shares-spike-80percent-in-unusual-move.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&par=sharebar). These shares are much more liquid and trade in higher volumes. Since the company’s Class B shares typically trade with less volume, and insider ownership (%float, more on the in a minute) is higher, this presents a better catalyst for a run-up.

Some key metrics:

||VIAC|VIACA|DISCA|DISCB|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shares Outstanding|587M|52M|162M|6.5M|
|Float|555M|555M|447M|447M|
|% Insider|4.12%|79.4%|2.84%|95%|
|% Institution|94.6%|16.5%|143.5%|7.4%|
|Shares Short (%Float)|102M (18.8%)|88k (1.7%)|46M (33%)|1k (0.4%)|

As you can see from the above table, both VIACA and DISCB are primarily owned by INSIDERS! This means they are **less likely to sell!** i.e. less liquidity! This means less volume can move the price upwards, evident by DISCB performance today. DISCB Average Volume: 3349 vs. Today:  **1,324,372...a 39445% INCREASE.**

Why is VIACA primed to fit the same narrative. The numbers closely match DISCB and we know short interest exists.

More Bullish Sentiment:

Fund closed all put positions and opened calls and bought shares after the Archegos Capital liquidation event.

[Fund Closed Puts, Opened Shares & Calls](https://preview.redd.it/4uaswyon3hq61.png?width=1887&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5c783987033e401ca600deb53466e56e17ef39)

Primary Play: Buy and Hold VIACA (Class A Shares) (need the volume), Secondary Play: Call Options (IV still below 100 at this time).

VIACA has avg volume 71 times that. Today VIACA's volume was already 4x than normal and it still went down 5% just like normal VIAC shares. I'm not saying it won't go up like DISCB I just think these are solid differences that might prevent it from 2 or 3xing.",['VIAC']

Now I may be called a boomer with this pick I can promise you I’m not. CVS Health is the largest healthcare company in the US with about the 4th/5th largest amount of revenue of all companies. They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price of $75 in insanely cheap in a market seeing the overall market trading at ~25x earnings.

Why is so cheap you may ask? Well I’d argue it’s for two reasons 1) Constant fear around Amazon 2) Concern they paid too much for Aetna a few years back. People always fear the unknown and it’s usually from a place of misunderstanding. Let’s take Amazon first. Amazon awhile back said they were going to get into Healthcare and formed a venture with Berkshire and JPM called Haven. I think CVS stock and others dropped 15% on the news when first announced. Now these are big companies and if anyone is going to upend the model it would be them. Well flash forward a few years and they disbanded the operation citing it was too challenging or something like that. This past year Amazon also made news by launching Amazon Pharmacy and more recently Amazon Telehealth for employers. I get what you’re thinking oh no here they come it’s over. This is absolutely hilarious if you actually understood how CVS makes money. Let me tell you how:

CVS has a few primary businesses: CVS Caremark, CVS Aetna, and CVS retail.

CVS Caremark is the largest drug dealer in the US. They are what is referred to as a PBM or prescription benefit manager. As an employer whether it be a public government agency or private employer like Amazon you go through a PBM to acquire your drug benefit coverage for your employees. CVS has thousands of employers ironically including Berkshire, JPM, and Amazon as clients. There are really only three main players in the space (Optum, Express Scripts, and Caremark) which are owned by United Health, Cigna, and CVS which also happen to be health insurers which we’ll get to later. This is where scale really matters. As an employer you want to give your employees the cheapest drugs. As a PBM you use your purchasing power across your customers to buy drugs from manufacturers at the lowest cost. This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry. Caremark probably buys almost 1/3 of the drugs dispensed in this country. This is why I laugh when I think about the Amazon fears. There is no way they could ever reach the scale of buying power to price drugs low enough to entice employers and government agencies to switch. Unless they’re throwing in a free Prime membership for everyone I think it’s basically impossible for them to break in unless they buy one of the big 3. So what is Amazon Pharmacy you ask? Amazon Pharmacy is just a re-branding of Amazon Pillpack their mail order pharmacy they acquired a few years back. Is it not a threat? Not in the least and that goes back to the pricing model many people don’t understand. Let me explain. If you’re covered by Caremark as an employee of say Wells Fargo you can go anywhere to fill your prescription...CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco, or even Amazon. However if you go onto GoodRx and enter your insurance info you’ll see that there are a variety of prices for the same drug. It will always be cheapest at CVS as Caremark will give CVS the best rates. What’s better is all those other places actually pay CVS to be included in their network and have access to their PBM network. So if you fill at Walgreens they make money and if you fill at CVS they make more money. So when people say Walgreens is just a drug store but CVS is more than a drugstore this is part of it. Walgreens and other places you fill drugs don’t have PBMs that represent a huge % of America’s insured.

Now let’s get to the real undervalued gem in their business Aetna. Aetna is the health insurance side of the business and fastest growing. This is the other part of the equation for employee benefits and again same major players in United Healthcare and Cigna. This business encompasses health and dental insurance. Aetna was acquired a few years back in one of the largest acquisitions and largely funded by debt. As you can imagine Wall St hated the deal except for the bankers that did it of course. What’s crazy is CVS was surprised and ecstatic that the deal even closed as it was heavily scrutinized by the Justice department at the time. What I would say about a deal that large is no Board would sign off on that if there wasn’t huge upside to the deal. I mean talk about YOLO let’s borrow a ton of money ($60B) and buy a company. If you are doing that there better be 3x or more the upside, right? So what was Wall St missing? Well first you have to understand the health insurance business which is the same premise as any insurance business which is to insure against risks. Geico insures you against a major car accident while Aetna insures you against a major medical surgery or cancer treatment. What many people don’t understand is the #1 cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance. Yes exercise but more so taking your medication. I like to say this is akin to Geico being able to tap your breaks if you start to speed in your car. CVS has your health data and if you’re an Aetna member they’re insuring you. So CVS can use that data to intervene early to prevent a major medical event they’d have to pay out on down the road. This is a win/win for all involved and is how CVS is going to change healthcare. I mean this is a health flywheel that will just allow them to win more business.

Where I’m most excited for them is for their Health Hub strategy. If you are unfamiliar think of it as urgent care within CVS stores. Why I’m most excited is because of what it allows them to do that their competitors can’t. I’m a parent and my wife and I have had many ear infections that we’ve had to run to the Little Clinic which is a similar concept you may have seen in Fry’s grocery stores. Today with our insurance an ear infection and a Little Clinic visit is about $75. Well Aetna is rolling out $0 co-pay plans for these acute care needs at Health Hub stores. $0 is pretty nice! So next time we have an ear infection we can roll up to a CVS Health Hub and get the kiddos checked out, pick up the script for meds, and pick up a bottle of wine for us on the way out. This has huge implications for the industry that nobody is quite grasping yet. It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits. Just today they said by 2030 they are looking to do 75 billion health interactions. For reference Teladoc did 15M last year in a pandemic year. 

So hopefully I’ve cleared up a lot of misconceptions about CVS and the true business they are in along with who their true competitors are. They are really in an oligopoly with 3 players who have paid the price of admission which is having a PBM and Health Insurance business combination. If Amazon truly wanted to play in this space my belief is that they’d have to acquire one of the 3 as they would have to buy business to compete with the scale/spend on drugs. I honestly think they realized with Haven that this is a tough nut to crack. So oligopoly businesses are usually good to invest in but the one you want to own is CVS because they have a monopoly in stores. There is a CVS within a few miles of everyone in the US which allows them to unlock a lot of value that people have written off as useless before.

Valuation:
Currently trading at $75 which is ~10 earnings in a market that is over 25x. So it’s way too cheap here but this isn’t a stock to YOLO weekly calls on this is stock to own for a long time. A couple years back they put out an investor presentation showing 10% EPS growth annually past 2022. The best part is it was based on 28% tax rates so tax increases baked in. If you actually model this out this decade you’re talking $19+ dollars EPS in 2030. Throw a 15-20 multiple on that and you’re at $300+. Now I know stocks were going up like that in a month (ahem GME) but for the most part investors shouldn’t ever expect those returns overnight. SP500 annual avg. return is 10% and with where valuations and interest rates are at I suspect we’ll be lucky this decade to average that. So going back to CVS at current price of $75 with $300+ at end of this decade in the cards that works out to a pretty nice avg annualized return of close to 20% assuming you reinvest the dividends. And people might scoff at the thought of them doing double digit EPS growth but if you look up pre Aetna they did just that. Even if they fall short you might see 15% avg annualized which as an investor you can’t expect much better.

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!","['BRK.B', 'JPM', 'CVS', 'CI', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'WFC']"

GME is a great play and we must hold, but something else very interesting has happened in the market in the past week. The Hedge fund Archegos  got blown up when VIAC did an offering at 85 a share and the stock took a hit. They were leveraged 20x over according to some sources.  When this happened  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks of VIAC on their behalf, causing the stock to plummet taking out a ton of stop losses on the way down. This stock is solid it has a great balance sheet and just made 3 billion more cash on an offering that they could by back for 1.5 billion a few days later due to the hedge fund getting blown out of the water. Nothing fundamental has changed with the value of this stonk it is an amazing value right now.

Take a look at what has happened with another one of their holdings DISCB climbing like crazy now after the dip. Now are we going to let the institutions, that are buying as many shares as they can while attempting to keep the price around 45 to cause Max pain for options buyers, take all these free tendies or are you guys going to buy shares with me and ride this stonk back to the moon?","['GS', 'VIAC']"

mhgqnv,,wallstreetbets,post,1617227697,"$UWMC - What's currently going on & updatesHi fellow investors,

I want to break down why the stock is currently floating at high 7$ - Low 8$ right now and also discuss some positive sentiments in the upcoming months. 

1. Let’s start with what’s currently going on. $UWMC has a short interest of %10.72 on a float of 92.5M shares. This is very high for the amount of shares available in the public float. 92.5M \* %10.72 = 9,916,000 shares. 9,991,600 shares times let’s say 8$ your looking at $79,328,000, and that’s if it was shorted at 8$. Total float of 92.5M @ $8 =  $740,000,000. So, with this being in mind, the stock can be considered having quite a high short interest pertaining to the available public float.

2) UWMC announced that they're considering a Senior Notes Offering not to be confused with Senior Debt, of $700,000,000. This is to be used to pay off their MSR and for other corporation purposes. This has both detracted some investors and attracted investors at the same time. Is this a bad thing? Not all, it’s simply a way of raising capital for the company. Think venture capital, inside investors etc. The interest rate would be locked in at %5.5 which is very low and to be paid in 2029. This is actually a smart decision depending on how you look at it to pay off debt owed with a lower and cheaper interest loan. It’s essentially, a senior convertible bond. Prominent start ups and companies expected to have high growth typically use this option as it reduces risk and lowers interest. I mean, I’m not going to go into the nitty gritty of explaining what Senior Notes are, I’m sure someone will in the comments section for those interested. Senior notes are not considered good nor bad. They can be considered bad when a company is sinking like when GM went bankrupt but would be considered good for growing companies such as UWMC who are using it to strengthen their balance sheets and grow their business. Some investors see senior notes and sell out and that is one aspect of the reason for some sell offs. (This is not something to be concerned with at all, personal opinion). The senior note was proposed but has not been finalized in any way. What does this impact to your investment and the stock price? Apart from some people selling out of the stock, it has little affect.

The 3 big factors for the stock price chilling at around high $7 - $8 currently are 1) Current bearish market 2) High short volume % 3) Senior Note announcement/consideration. (Again, this is not a negative thing).

Positive sentiments: Dividends payout in April, will be added to the the Russell 1000 & 3000, if interest/inflation goes up that’s when UWMC or the wholesale channel in general actually makes more profit/revenue verses the retail channel. UWMC holds 34% market share, the largest in the country. So, all this inflation and interest talk going around, this would actually benefit UWMC to my understanding and not go against them. It would actually make them more competitive since wholesalers/brokers provide better rates, that’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. The other biggest factors for positive sentiments is the fact that the stock is extremely undervalued, has great fundamentals, and has a solid balance sheet. This isn’t a GME or an AMC, etc. This stock is a completely different play all together and a great hedge in this bearish market; that’s currently on sale at it's current price and provides high dividend payouts of %4.83 or $0.10 per share quarterly.

This is not financial advice, this is just my personal DD on the current price range UWMC is currently trading at. Have faith and patience my fellow investors and put those 💎🖐 to the test. (Disclaimer: Do whatever you want, I'm personally going to 💎🖐 no doubt).

I hope this proves useful to you in some way or another and that you all make a bunch of tendies. 🚀🌔

TL;DR - Stock price is being affected because of the bearish market, short interest and short volume%, and the senior notes offering announcement/consideration.

**\*\*Edit: Something I forgot to add and didn't mention that I think everyone is overlooking is the fact that UWMC has their own proprietary software & system to process mortgage applications and are the fastest in the business at qualifying and closing applications. This benefits both B2C and B2B. B2C: 1). Faster closing time. 2). Better rates. B2B: Fast closing time, more applications completed, more revenue and profits.**

**This is a critical competitive differentiator among it's competition and market. This also attracts more business, mortgage brokers, and customers. They also came out with their new jumbo convertible product which is going to further enhance growth. Sorry, I forget to highlight all this in the post.\*\***","['GM', 'UPS']"

Owing some kind of allegiance to any single company is inherently a dumb fucking idea. We're not here for turf wars, we're here to take risks and gamble our money. Personally, I couldn't fucking care less which company makes me gains and, ideally, if the industry itself does well - which *it likely will for the next 2 years at least* \- you come out ahead regardless.  


If you ignore the RKT comparison. Currently, UWMC is trading near its all-time low. At under $8.00/share it's a steal that anyone should be happy to get in on since buying it today is equal to buying it before it's run above-$12 back in January. If it drops any lower, it just makes averaging down from sub-$8 that much easier because you can just buy more. The company isn't going to go bankrupt and there is plenty of opportunities for it to run again.

Their best-in-class automotive LiDAR A-sample will be complete in April and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions, there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. CEO Sumit Sharma used to be Director of Google Glass. BOD Mark Spitzer has ties to Google. Judy Curran was appointed to the BOD a few months ago, she’s a major power player in autonomous driving with deep ties to Ford (Ford and Google have a strategic partnership). The newest BOD, Seval Oz, is a major power player in autonomous driving with major ties to Google.  Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC yet. The only logical reason for her not doing so is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). Several BoD’s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock.

mhbbb9,,wallstreetbets,post,1617212185,"Listen you dumb fucks (deferred revenue) & IVY roll out $BBSo, I was pissed yesterday. Then I read between the lines and other boards and I believe they would have outperformed the revenue line if not for the patent sale upcoming.

Chen said that yearly income on patents is 250 M$. 250/4= 62.5 M$. Now, look at the deferred revenue line you apes between q4 and q3. It went up 61 million.

This is not counted in this quarter's revenue because if they sell the patents this revenue will probably go to the buyer and BB will get what they sell it for.

Clearly, people want it to go down but without this patent sale, they would be in line if not outperform the revenue expectation of 246 M$.

**So what about IVY**?

The timeframe for the IVY release day is coming sooner than expected! We can expect it in February 2022 which is insane, I was thinking we’d have to wait many more years to see that released. Yes, you read that right, February 2022!!

The thing is, so many people still don’t know Ivy exists and once we start seeing live demos of Ivy in action I expect new investors to flood in and the price to go up significantly. Nothing like Ivy exists on the market today and there are endless opportunities with this technology.

In the meantime, now that the quiet period is over I’m expecting a flood of new releases from BB and I’m super excited. Another catalyst will be drones, hoping to hear more on that sometime this year.

Furthermore, BlackBerry now has design wins with 23 of the top 25 EV OEM’s, up from 19 of the top 25 last quarter.

mhbvb7,,wallstreetbets,post,1617213771,"Canoo $GOEV - State of the Union - First Earnings Report**TLDR: Canoo's deal with Hyundai was terrible. Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing top hats, factories and etc). Production and model timeline is still on track.**

Monday's earnings call was Canoo's single largest event since it deSPACed ($HCAC => $GOEV). For those who don't know me, I've written the original [Canoo/BangBus DD last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzioed/mega_dd_bangbus_ev_going_public_everything_you/) which speculated the Apple partnership ([which turned out to be true](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)), I'm a mod on r/canoo, I'm active in most Canoo channels (Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, Discord and etc) and I love to share whatever I stumble across (like [leaking the Canoo pickup truck](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/)). This is not financial advice, I am not employed by Canoo nor represent them in any way and I do have a position in Canoo (see below).

I'll start off with this number: **$8.9m**. This is how much Tony Aquila (Canoo's Chairman) personally lost between Monday's close and Tuesday's close. While we've all lost in the past day (I personally lost six-figures), Tony has lost more than any of us. While I'm not apologizing for him, I'm sure he too feels the fire of deep red in his investment. However, much of what Tony said, absolutely needed to be said. The moves he made has set up Canoo for long term success and I'll explain why.

I was looking forward to the Contract Engineering revenue and became disappointed when we did not see it. I truly believed this additional revenue stream would've been huge in the short term price movement. After all, OEMs are reaching out to Canoo for their expertise, while other companies are rolling trucks down hills or [trying to build vehicles that don't erupt in flames](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39788/lordstown-motors-endurance-prototype-caught-fire-ten-minutes-into-first-test-drive). Having listened to Tony's reasoning and looking at [Canoo's financials](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/52/canoo-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results), I completely understand why he nixed the Contract Engineering.

Let's go back to the end of 2019. Canoo was a young company. Developing electric vehicles is very capital intensive. Canoo's liabilities exceeded their assets, and at the end of 2019 they had a mere $31m in cash with $11m in current liabilities. While Canoo developed a great product, and held some cash, it may have not been enough to continue to gamma stages let alone enough capital to build vehicles for their subscription model. On the heels of Stefan Krause being ousted, Canoo was in turmoil. Senior members saw the writing on the wall, and started to leave in 2019 to early 2020. So, Uli Kranz (CTO, then interim CEO) and the remaining engineers did what they do best, find projects to work on. Enter Hyundai.

While the partnership with Hyundai may not have been ideal, it would've doubled Canoo's cash on hand. With a world-class engineering team on idle, it seemed like a really great idea to reallocate resources. As the saying goes, one in the hand, is better than two in the bush.

However, in hindsight, it turned out to be a terrible deal. Keep in mind Canoo's skateboard cost $250m to develop. We initially speculated the Contract Engineering revenue was $34m, but on the earnings call, it turned out to be even less at $25m. Furthermore, it's very difficult to differentiate your own IP versus the work you've been contracted for:

* If you developed a better skateboard for your client, you cannot use this superior skateboard as it belongs to the client.
* If you developed a worse skateboard for your client, you've now knowingly given your client an inferior product (see [Tesla vs Fisker](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-vs-fisker-the-epilogue-or-why-tesla-owes-fisker-11-million-3052/)).
* If you give your client your skateboard as-is, the client just received a skateboard that takes 3-5 years to design/engineer and possibly billions ([Faraday](https://www.businessinsider.com/jia-yueting-faraday-future-tesla-rival-bankrupt-2020-1)) if not $500+ million ([Dyson](https://electrek.co/2020/05/18/dyson-cancelled-electric-car/#:~:text=Dyson%20has%20unveiled%20its%20abandoned,on%20its%20own%20electric%20vehicle)), for a measly $25m. Congratulations, you just played yourself.

As you can see, none of these scenarios are ideal for Canoo. If I were Hyundai, I'd be all over this deal too. No wonder Hyundai was so quick to jump on this deal, especially after announcing their partnership with Arrival just a month prior.

**Upon closing the SPAC, Canoo is flush with cash. They no longer need the Contract Engineering revenue, and are actually better off without it.**

With this conflict of interest, I now see why many automakers are turning their backs to Apple. Why help a competitor to make a better product, for very minimal upside for yourself? As an engineer that signed up to join an exciting start-up like Canoo, would you be happy if you were pimped out to another company to engineer something that's not better, but not worse, but not the same, as something you've already created?

With that being said, Tuesday's price action was absolutely blown out of proportion, and I took advantage and bought GOEV warrants ($GOEVW) with both hands. Remember, we never knew details of the deal with Hyundai. Now knowing that the Contract Engineering would've produced minimal revenue, no royalties/on-going income, while delaying core projects, wouldn't you have cut this too? By killing the Contract Engineering, Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing tophats, factories and etc). For quick math, Canoo foregone $25m in contract revenue. Let's assume Magna would've charged $5000 for each vehicle. If Canoo instead reallocated resources towards building a facility, they would earn all that lost revenue within the first year ($5000 x 10,000 vehicles first year = $50m saved), while protecting their own IP.

Also, an important fact to consider was that Tony revealed that the contract value was based on labor of engineers (e.g. hourly rate), not value of IP. Meaning, Canoo charged a mark-up on top of their existing employee’s salary, rather than charging based on the hundreds of millions (if not billions) in IP they were receiving. While I do think Uli is a great leader, this was a great misstep under his watch.

With all the focus on the Hyundai agreement, we lost sight of gems uncovered in the earnings report/call:

* Internationalization. Lots of demand in Europe. International sales coming online soon.
* Better idea of cash on hand and operating expenses.
   * We are in a very healthy financial position. One-third of our market cap is cash. Canoo also has a mere $27m in current liabilities and <$7m in long-term debt. **If this isn’t a deep value play, I don’t know what is.**
* Timeline and order of models have not changed: LV, MPDV, PU. We are still on track for production next year.
* Working closely with State Governors to obtain the greatest benefits/incentives.
   * These discussions could save tens or even hundreds of millions down the road. While I would’ve liked to get confirmation on Monday, we cannot rush this crucial process.
* Acknowledged Investor Relation's lack of communication.

Tony also stated some milestones to look out for:

* Gamma vehicle progress.
* Reporting reservations vs pre-orders.
* Lock in geographics and contract manufacturing partners.
* State level partnerships.

As of Tuesday’s close, Canoo had a $2b market cap. Canoo has $700m in cash, and IP worth anywhere from $250m to $1b+. In comparison, Fisker has a $5b market cap and virtually no IP, no engineering and no proprietary technology. Lucid, which has a \~$40b market cap, is worth 20x Canoo, yet, they are only months apart from manufacturing. Canoo at a $2b market cap (<$10 share price) is an absolute steal in comparison to other players in the field.

**My bull case from last year still applies. The $18/$25/$30 price targets for management's earn out shares applies. I still have a $30 price target, which I'm confident we'll hit this year.**

**Positions: 130,001 warrants.** These warrants should be worth $18+ once $GOEV hits $30.

Last week, I posted my first ever DD on MVIS. I recommend you read it here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs\_friday\_dd\_mvis/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs_friday_dd_mvis/)

If you missed it, today MVIS took flight as it pulled 50%ish on the day. It took liftoff at the start of power hour and, after 20 glorious minutes, began the trend sideways to eventually close at $18.55 (up from sub-$14.00).

**Why did this happen?**

Well, Microsoft won a contract with the U.S. Army for augmented-reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 B over 10 years: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

I believe, as I explain in my DD, MVIS is going to continue it's rise all throughout 2021. I have different price targets depending on scenarios but for the short-term, I believe MVIS will hit $29 by end of the month (APR).

**How will it get there? What's new this past week besides the spike?**

1. MVIS is going to be showing off their LiDAR in an APR demo. They were still on track to meet their goals during their last report.
2. Biden Infrastructure Plan - Building a national EV charging system, promoting vehicle exchanges from less efficient gas-powered cars to full EV or hybrid EVs. EVs and autonomous vehicles go hand-in-hand so this plan is great for MVIS as well.
3. MORE job openings (up to 17 now thus confirming my claim last week that hiring would ramp up): [http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj](http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj)
4. Buyout possibility still on the table from a T1 tech company that *may or may not* already be invested in MVIS tech (RE: MVIS DD)
5. MVIS dropped hard with the NASDAQ dumping last week but as of today is the BEST recovery stock impacted
6. Short-interest is still a factor with >1 day to cover:

Short Volume Ratio: 13% (down from 30% last week) - [https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis)

% of Volume Shorted as of Mar. 30: 33.46% (down from 64.98% last week) - [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS)

% of Shares Shorted:  15.32% (up from 12.64% last week) - [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/)

Summary Quote: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&submit=Short+Quote)

There are excellent long and short-term opportunities to play here. So for those feeling the FOMO, I believe there's still plenty of time to get in even if the sub-$14.00 bargain price is gone.

mhipon,,wallstreetbets,post,1617233973,"Why Altria (MO) is the ABSOLUTE GOATED WeedStock that you chucklenuts are sleeping on 🚀🚀🚀 Firstly I don’t need to educate any of you on the uprising of WeedStocks over this next month 

&#x200B;

[LETS GOOOOOOOO](https://preview.redd.it/tvrcw6oc8gq61.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff81522e9f4848194c1894f9aee7de723d5a46ce)

However you absolute buffoons have been purchasing Canadian stocks for the coming of American legalization, IE: APHA, SNDL (which is cool for short term I guess) because you're purchasing in hopes other idiots will make the same mistake, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the real value that comes with American legalization, and that’s American companies adapting. 

Altria is an american tobacco company that's been genuinely thriving, and purchased a couple of patents for cannabis in the off chance it ever did get legalized. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/93tzcuui8gq61.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5e62d9624696e10d4787e05d50953c4b87d42cd

“Ok but how does that differ than most other cannabis or pre-established cannabis stocks” you might ask, drool dripping down your double chin, to which I reply-

GOOD QUESTION, when I say this stock is thriving, I mean it’s t h r i v i n g, coming out of an insane dip from 2017-early 2020, MO just got moved to the investors “BUY” list and had its fair value increased to 58$ last week just off of its tobacco business alone.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zlzd13zo8gq61.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=f38a62afa129da40c28004a088db8f1312e5452b

&#x200B;

 But I havent even fucking mentioned the dividends  W O O  L A D 

Every couple of months the stockholders of MO get back 0.86 on each share in dividends which is basically just free fucking money for not pulling out, and you best believe that before every dividend payoff date you can see a considerable spike in the price of the stock, only for it to retain that price (falling slightly after payoff, if any).

AND IT GETS EVEN WACKIER

&#x200B;

They’ve been raising their dividend price every fucking year for the past 51 years.

Anyways, to conclude, this stock has an assload going for it even without the weed, but you best bet that once weed gets introduced into the mix this April, this thing’s going to explode. This is one of my longs

(Positions: 300 shares, 51 contracts expiring September)

My best advice would be to hop in now while the price is low(er).

# TLDR; $ROOT has a rare Short Squeeze opportunity with a Short interest of 47.36%! In addition to it being undervalued.

# So What's Root?

**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).

(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a “four-year head start”** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.

With over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.

# Big boys invested in ROOT

Five months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.

Two years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT’s market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT’s Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.

(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**

# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?

Last year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).

The good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**

The original bear argument was centered around $ROOT’s high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company’s Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT’s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.

# Root 2021 Growth

Growth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**

“We were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.”

“We plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.”

This step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).

**Daily Downloads – ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**

&#x200B;

[Daily Downloads – ROOT \(Green\) vs. LMND \(Blue\)](https://preview.redd.it/ruourewtreq61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=673dd2afdb04c6097a4659c4690f30e51572c496)

# Now for the Most important Part!

**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**

In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)

# Price Target

Without factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.

""This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago."" C\*Tron

**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**

My hypothesis has been that it would either tank day 1, or show steady (not rocket ship) growth.

Well, the results are in for day 1 and it didn’t tank. It is up over 30%. I expect some profit taking tomorrow from people who wanted a quick gain (and got it!) and then a climb back up again in the short and long term.

I went ahead and bought 10 shares this evening and will double down if it dips tomorrow.

I have personally used them for a certification. Led to a $10K raise at work as a direct result. Also shared on my LinkedIn profile which was a nice touch for recruiting to potential new jobs.

My company is now using them for training. These guys are light years ahead in an industry that is full of decade(s) old technology that never got updated.

The pandemic has shut down all kinds of seminars and workshops and corporations are moving training budgets from expensive in-person conferences with hotel and airfare and meal costs, into professional grade training such as Coursera that associates can do from the office (or home).

I think this is going to grow and continue growing as companies realize how much more efficient this approach is than flying people all over the world for 3 day workshops.

mh8q4p,,wallstreetbets,post,1617204903,"VZIO: The IPO That Flew Under the Radar 

Hello fellow degenerates.

VZIO  IPO'd last Friday and it appears to have flown largely under the radar  which I'd attribute to all the other crazy shit happening last week. I  didn't even know about it until shares were already for sell. The shares  went on sale in the 17-18 dollar range, way under the proposed 21-23  range. Seeing this looked at the numbers and bought some shares because I  thought they were impressive.

I'm  just gonna throw it out there that I am not a financial expert and this  is my first time reading numbers from a prospectus document so if you  see any logical errors or bad numbers please point them out. I'll  largely be using the numbers I got from the prospectus document found  here: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/)

As  of last Friday VZIO has put 15.2 million shares for sale on the market.  The company's total shares outstanding as of 2020 was \~144million  (these aren't on sale, just held by inside investors). At the current  stock price of 24.5 that puts the company's market cap at about 3.5  billion. According to RH VZIO's current P/E is about 4.45, which is  insanely low for a well known brand and a growth stock, which leads me  to believe the stock is majorly undervalued. The stock price could  easily quadruple to put the P/E around 20 which is more inline with  competitors.

The last couple of  years VZIO has transitioned from being just a hardware company selling  TVs to also becoming a streaming server provider. Because of the low  margins on this service it has become a huge income stream for them and a  source of extraordinary growth. Think of their streaming service like  Roku, but actually built into the TV. VZIO's income and revenue for the  past couple years were:

Total net revenue

2019 $1,836,799,000

2020 $2,042,473,000

Total gross profit

2019 $165,165,000

2020 $296,358,000

Net income

2019 $23,086,000

2020 $102,475,000

The  net income increase was largely due to the profits from their Platform+  revenue which has grown 304% from $36.4million in 2018 to $147 million  in 2020. The CEO states that the company plans to reinvest that money  into the hardware side of the business to develop better TVs. Another  bonus is that the CEO has deep ties to Asia manufacturing which has  proven to be extremely helpful in them securing required components for  their TVs and keeping their supply lines healthy while competitors face  shortages.

Taken form the  prospective document as of December 31, 2020, Vizio had $207.7 million  in cash and $625.8 million in total liabilities.

Vizio's recent financial results can be summed up as follows:

* Increasing operating profit and margin (They are making more money and making more money with less cost)
* Growing topline revenue
* Sharply increased gross profit and gross margin
* Growing earnings
* Reduced cash flow from operations

The  HD TV market is growing and expected to grow substantially in the next  few years. As of 2020 Vizio also made up the third largest brand of HD  tvs in American homes, so it has massive name recognition.  VZIO has a  lot of big rivals to compete against in this growing market that may try  to take out the smaller competitors. The name recognition might help  VZIO's potential for acquisition by a large player seeking to quickly  enter the Smart TV/connected home market by buying out an established  brand. In the past VZIO has shown it is willing to sale. It was supposed  to be purchased by a Chinese company a few years ago, but the deal fell  through.

In the short-term all  the stimulus will likely keep demand for TVs purchase high, which makes  short term prospects for VZIO look pretty good. The long-term potential  for growing their operating margins through streaming services, a ever  growing TV market, and the potential for buyout makes them a solid place  to park some money.

TLDR;

The  company is profitable, growing in the streaming segment, increasing  earning, and has all the right ingredients to become a big player in the  next generation of connected TVs by offering a TV + streaming service  similar to ROKU but in one piece of hardware. Also, there's only 15  million shares on the open market so a lot of demand can cause a big  increase in the stock price in the short term.

Positions: 100 shares of VZIO.",['HD']

mgw14i,,wallstreetbets,post,1617157442,"GME Open Interest on Options - What we might seeWill preface by saying I am retarded ape.

I was reviewing the options chain for April 1st, and how much open interest there is:

&#x200B;

[\(+\/-50 is the amount of open interest 50 above\/below current price\)](https://preview.redd.it/cycosgy7q9q61.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=75885002583bc47574c5060828ad5dc7068f4177)

It looks like there are far more calls in the money or near the money. It looks like there are some major pain points on both sides depending on where it ends up Thursday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9wu99jv3v9q61.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb708a31a5ea9544267dc993c22fdc999a60c2d

As you can see, it looks like $169 is the break even where there is the same amount of open interest. At the $220 mark we see a pretty massive shift, and at $250 puts are almost completely wiped out. If I were a hedge fund with lots of puts, I would be saving all my ammo for Thursday to get this down below $169.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/upr3l4u5w9q61.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ccaf6c7119b9772a5059e14bc523a1613592ca

It also looks like we might see some major pressure around the $250 mark, as that could really spice things up if we ended $250+ by eod Thursday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** Bears need $170 or below by EOW to gain the upperhand leading into next week. If it ends \~$180-$190, good chance we don't see too much of a change next week, maybe a bit of downward pressure. If we hit $250 by EOW, we **might** see something big happen.

&#x200B;

Edit: If you think this is a GME TO THE MOON THURSDAY post because of open interest I don't think you read it right. I am just expressing where I see a majority of the options rest and where  I think we might see a lot of action occur/what it might mean for next week (@ $170, $220 and $250).

**Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR:**

Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it?  CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. 

Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you -  skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell.

Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack.

That's what CRISPR is. **It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA.** 

**Why NTLA?**

Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases?

Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it.

Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. 

This experimental ""drug"", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. **Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently.**

**Why now?**

On Tuesday, the **EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug**. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. **Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug.**

So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union.

**Strategy**

This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. **This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum**, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well.

**TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES.**

Recently investment fund Archegos caused $30 billion dollars in market selling as a result of failed overleveraged (LOL) margin calls, with many positions being leveraged 8:1 and some as bad as 20:1! As a result, over the recent week we saw share price in ViacomCBS ($VIAC) & Discovery ($DISCA) fall as far as 50% 👀  Whenever a security takes a plunge like this, especially since its caused by a forced sellers rather than a technical or corporate change, they return! This is basically a half off sale on two very very large and successful media corps. Viacom owns BET, Paramount, CBS, CBS Streaming, CBS News & CBS Sports, Discovery is discovery channel. 

As you can see, we are pushing the very bottom of a 1D/1Y regression channel, looking for BIG push this week or next on both securities. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!

 ViacomCBS was downgraded to underweight from equal weight with a $59 price target, down from its previous $82 per share target. Viacom shares were falling 14.2% to $56.91 Friday. 

Meanwhile, Discovery was downgraded to equal weight from overweight and its price target was lowered to $59 per share from $65 per share. Discovery shares were down 21.9% to $45.13 Friday**.**

mgkwis,,wallstreetbets,post,1617124331,"GME is about to breakout and I think this is whyHello Apes and hedgies, this is my first attempt at a TA and i will be utilizing technical indicators. 

So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

&#x200B;

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. 

This is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. 

TLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon

Edit: The yellow line is the MACD line and the red line is the signal line. When the MACD line crosses it upwards the momentum is up meaning price increase. Obviously vice versa on a downward cross.",
