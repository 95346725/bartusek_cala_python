mlux4z,,stocks,post,1617772525,"For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing.(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

**last edit: swords for plowshares boys**

PS: I upvoted you all so far, love this late(early) discussion. Going to sleep now. Whether you agree with me or not, I wish you all solid gains. It is not about you or them, or your gains vs his/her loss. I hope you all make gains and that my small insite can lead future generations(or my own or past) to an easy life where we maybe don't have yachts or pent houses, but at the same time.... have to die young of stress and ill health, and can just have the money to be content and happy and be like me,... spending this week digging a new garden, and not be broken old men/women like I see so often.

And if you dont like that, if you say everyone should ""pull up them boot straps"" then I say Fuk you. That didn't work. So I won, and I hope I can teach even one kid to win to

Best of all, absolutely NO fee involved with that fund. It’s just as good as Vanguard’s total market fund and is even cheaper. 

I would suggest the same fund in a separate taxable brokerage account as well. It’s good to have some outside of retirement investing as well to save and grow your money for goals that are closer than retirement.

I regret spending the vast majority of my money on absolutely worthless shit.

It doesn't matter if you can only save $100 a month, it matters that you start saving early in life and as much as you can.  Compound interest will kick your account in the balls around the $500k mark, and once you get over $1M you will be banking a year's salary just in interest.

The company's patent portfolio comprises around 20,000 patent families -- inventions patented in more than one country -- including more than 3,500 that have been declared essential to next-generation 5G networks.

Nokia said on Wednesday that it had concluded a multiyear, multi-technology patent cross-licensing agreement with Lenovo , putting an end to all pending patent litigation and other proceedings between the two companies.

""The agreement reflects Nokia's ( [NOK](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=NOK) ) decades long investments in R&D and contributions to cellular and multimedia standards,"" said Jenni Lukander, the president of patent, technology, and brand licensing business.

The terms of the technology-sharing agreement remain confidential, but Lenovo will make a net balancing payment to Nokia, the Finnish company said.

John Mulgrew, Lenovo's chief intellectual property officer, said the agreement with Nokia reflects the value of both Nokia's technology leadership and Lenovo's continued investment in 5G innovation."" Mulgrew added that the accord will facilitate future collaboration between the two companies.",

New York Gov Cuomo has said he wants to run the state's sports betting industry through the New York Lottery, which is run by the government. Under his plan, the New York state Lottery would issue requests for proposals from only a few mobile betting operators, which it could then license out to other sportsbook operators.

This is somewhat different from how other states run online sports betting. States like Pennsylvania and New Jersey allow for several casinos to legally operate, forcing higher competition for customers.

In this case the state runs the lottery and the state gets the revenue. Stocks like DKNG up 2.52% after hours, MGM 1.13% AH, PENN 1.1% AH. 

As a long time DKNG holder I’m excited and hoping this can be a good catalyst. It’s only a matter of time as more and more states officially legalize online gambling.

](https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/)

Background excerpt on V2G:

> The technology is often referred to as “vehicle-to-grid.”

> An electric vehicle with bidirectional charging capacity can send power pack into the grid, or a home, or even another electric vehicle.

Competition:

> The Nissan Leaf is the most popular EV with the capacity, but that’s about it.

> However, there are many new EVs coming with the capacity. The new Hyundai Ioniq 5 is equipped with the technology, and Tesla has commented that all future vehicles will be equipped with bidirectional charging capacity.

Translation of Handelsblatt excerpt:

> “The test vehicles are running, we are in the last pulls with the preparations,” confirms VW Development Board Member Thomas Ulbrich in an interview with the Handelsblatt. From 2022 onwards, **every electric car from the Volkswagen Group that is developed on the basis of the MEB** (“modular electrification kit”) electrical platform can not only charge the electricity but also return it to the grid. In addition to VW, the MEB is also used by the sister brands Audi , Skoda and Seat-Cupra.

Commentary elsewhere:

https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/

> Carmakers that dive into the business of smoothing the grid would benefit more than financially, also. By saving unused renewable energy for future use to feed into the power grid, the vehicle industry would also acquire knowledge of how much storage capacity would actually be available at certain times.

> **For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.**",['TSLA']

mlvi50,,stocks,post,1617774940,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIOHey again everyone,

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)","['TWTR', 'IR', 'TSLA']"

On April 2, while the market was closed, JFrog quietly made a major change to their licensing/pricing model.

**So what does this mean for the stock?** A study of Fortune 500 companies found that increasing subscription prices by 5% results in a 22% jump in operating profits (http://users.metu.edu.tr/mugan/Hinterhuber%202004%20value%20based%20pricing.pdf).

Details of their new subscription model is live on JFrog’s website at https://jfrog.com/pricing/#hosted. A summary of the changes, as far as I can tell:

1.	Pricing changed for all tiers, increasing cost per customer by 10-40% depending on what product they own
2.	All their subscription tiers now mandatorily include their vulnerability scanning component, which was optional under the previous model
3.	They have introduced some utilization-based pricing that will allow for organic growth as customers increase their number of development projects

mlkrxa,,stocks,post,1617740441,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 6, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 6, 2021**

Stocks traded roughly flat Tuesday, putting a pause on the recent record-breaking rally. Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies' first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that's actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that's taking the market higher. And I don't think we're done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you're going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.""

The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon.

mlqtb0,gtp3023,stocks,comment,1617808562,"This was a great read (only halfway through so far but I'll finish by the end of the day) thank you for doing this. I'm probably one of the rare people on here that was into Poshmark before I got interested in investing so here is my personal insight FWIW.

Back in the summer of 2018 I had a goal of selling one Reformation dress I didn't mean to buy at one of their sample sales. I knew about poshmark and depop but for whatever reason I can't recall now, I chose to list it on Poshmark. (Maybe it was the fact they took care of shipping, whereas with depop it was up to the buyer/seller to coordinate shipping labels and that aspect will completely turn me off even if it means I'm making money) Long story short, not only did I sell this dress I hated, I made more money than I bought it for. I started listing more random things I could find in my closet that I didn't like anymore, and at this point I've ""made"" about $3,500 from passive selling. I do have *a lot* of clothes but this is in no way a business for me, just a means of getting rid of unwanted clothes. I never thought I would be using this app long-term like this, I don't even care for the ""social"" aspects of it but goddamn, it works. When I spend time (usually while watching TV) ""sharing"" other peoples' listings, and they in turn share mine, my sales go up. I can't explain it but clearly something is working here.

When I talk to friends who are more interested in the fashion scene than I am, they say depop is definitely the cooler app, esp among Gen z. (we're millennials) At this point, I have about 300 listings in my poshmark closet, and I've been doing just fine, and won't be switching. (this is from the sellers' perspective, obviously as a buyer you can jump around from app to app no problem) I think there is a space for many reselling platforms, and I certainly don't think poshmark is going anywhere anytime soon esp with the infrastructure they've built. I think poshmark should incentive sellers to become buyers on their platform, say, instead of taking a 20% cut for me to cash in my sales, they take a 15% cut and turn my sale money into ""poshmark bucks"" or credit or what have you. 

When I read financial analysts' comments on $posh and they say things like ""why wouldn't you just use Ebay or Facebook Marketplace"" for me personally, I've don't shop for clothes on ebay. about 5 years ago, there was a pair of Frye boots I wanted that were sold out everywhere and eventually I found them on ebay and did buy them but I remember thinking it was weird to buy clothes/shoes on ebay. i think of ebay for tools and antiques, not clothes. and fb marketplace? am I supposed to drive 1.5 hours to the town over to pick up a top I like from some girl selling it maybe $20 less than I could get it in the store? no thanks. clearly these analysts don't understand this app

Anyway, I'm basically brand new to investing, I have about 55 shares of POSH at the moment, I bought in when I thought there was a dip at like $65, clearly it kept dipping so I've been able to average down to $46/share. I'm going to wait till it dips below $40 again to get more. I don't really understand how shorting works, I see the chart, but it cuts off at the end of March. How do we know if it is still being shorted?","['EBAY', 'FB']"

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. . (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income, )

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Crazy.

&#x200B;

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities finished lower in fairly uneventful Tuesday trading, selling off through the afternoon to end a bit off worst levels. Followed a Monday rally that saw the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all up more than 1%. Sector performance was mixed and fairly bunched. Tech trailed with some weakness in semis and networking. Financials lagged on bank weakness. Consumer sectors outperformed. Utilities led the market. Treasuries were firmer with the curve flattening (10s back below 1.70%). Some discussion about very elevated short position in TLT. Dollar was weaker vs yen and euro. Gold finished up 0.8%. WTI crude ended up 1.2%, though off best levels, after falling more than 4.5% in the prior session.
   * A very quiet day with few notable headlines. Bullish narrative remains underpinned by the same constellation of themes including reopening momentum, accelerating vaccinations, potential for $4T+ in new fiscal stimulus later this year, and Fed's high bar for tapering and liftoff. Some commentary as well about market growing more comfortable with higher rate backdrop. Earnings season shaping up as another potential tailwind for risk sentiment amid upward revision activity. Multiple compression from higher yields, taper tantrum, central bank policy mistake, new coronavirus variants, higher taxes, and margin pressure from higher input costs some of the more widely discussed risks.
   * Major shift on the fiscal policy front was Monday's ruling by the Senate parliamentarian that **Democrats can use reconciliation additional times this year** to bypass GOP filibuster threats. However, Democrats still facing challenge of crafting a plan to appease its whole caucus (settling on a corporate tax rate an early challenge). Elsewhere, **JOLTS job openings for February well ahead of expectations**, while reports continue to highlight worker shortages. **IMF raised global growth estimate** by 50 bp to 6.0%. **White House announced accelerated vaccination timeline** while US vaccination rate nearly 5x faster than global average. Bloomberg had latest on **China tightening credit**.
   * **BP** expects to hit net debt target sooner than expected. **ILMN** positively preannounced and said most customers at or above pre-COVID levels. **LUV** latest airline to call pilots back to work. **PSX** negatively preannounced, partly due to headwinds from winter storm. **PAYX** down despite slightly better results and positive client retention comments. **CS** reported $4.7B hit from Archegos Capital saga, along buyback suspension, dividend reduction and management turnover. **NCLH** announced two-prong plan for returning to cruising outside US. **DCT** beat but guidance mixed. **SIG** announced acquisition of Rocksbox. **Topps** coming public via merger with SP@C MUDS.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Sector performance mixed with healthcare, tech trailing:**
      * **Tech** trailed the market with semis and networking/communication some of the drags. **Healthcare** underperformed amid weakness in pharma and managed care. **Energy** was weaker, with integrateds mixed and oil-services names largely lower. Road/rail names lagged in **industrials**, though airlines were better. **Financials** lagged the tape with banks generally lower alongside the pullback in Treasury yields. Media, entertainment, telecom were mostly better in **communication services**, thought the megacap internets were down. **Materials** was a relative outperformer, helped by precious metals and paper/packaging but seeing some drag from steel names. **Consumer discretionary** being boosted by retailers, restaurants, and leisure groups. **Consumer staples** saw strength in beverages and food-products stocks. **Utilities** led the market.
   * **Senate parliamentarian allows Democrats to make another reconciliation push:**
      * Democrats scored a key procedural win yesterday when Senate Parliamentarian MacDonough ruled they can pass additional measures for the current fiscal year through reconciliation, the simple-majority method allowing them to bypass an expected GOP filibuster ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/us/politics/democrats-senate-reconciliation-infrastructure.html), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/546215-senate-parliamentarian-to-let-democrats-bypass-filibuster-with-third-bill)). Majority Leader Schumer (D-NY) had argued a 1974 law allows budget resolutions to be revised, with which the parliamentarian concurred. Ruling opens key legislative pathway for Biden's expected two-phase infrastructure and stimulus plan but process still likely to be challenging as Democrats need to prevent any defections from their caucus, and more moderate Sens. Manchin and Sinema have argued against using reconciliation again this year. Reconciliation can also eat up large amounts of legislative floor time as both parties can offer multiple amendments. And not all bills can be passed through reconciliation (recall a minimum-wage component was stripped from Biden's $1.9T American Rescue Plan).
   * **February job openings higher than expected, companies need workers:**
      * Job openings increased by 268K, or 3.8% in February to just under 7.4M, well ahead of the 6.9M consensus. JPMorgan noted that the 615K increase in January and February represented the largest two-month gain for the series going back to 2000, apart from the sharp recovery in the early stages of the pandemic. Job openings rate increased by 0.2pp to 4.9%, and the hiring rate increased by 0.2pp to 4.0%. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3%. Fits with heightened focus on labor market recovery following blowout March payrolls data last Friday. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/u-s-airlines-step-up-pilot-recalls-as-travel-demand-rebounds?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how airlines are bringing back more pilots as travel demand rebounds. Delta was recently forced to cancel flights due to staffing shortages. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fast-food-labor/fast-food-struggles-to-hire-as-demand-soars-u-s-economy-roars-idUSKBN2BT1GB) highlighted the struggles the fast-food industry is having in trying to hire enough workers to keep up with a surge in sales. Noted that worker shortfall is hardly limited to hospitality.
   * **Credit Suisse discloses $4.7B hit from Archegos fallout:**
      * Credit Suisse said today it will take a $4.7B writedown related to the forced liquidations of positions held by Archegos Capital, the \~$10B family office of Bill Hwang, who founded and ran Tiger Asia. The bank said the charge will result in a pretax loss of 900M francs for Q1, cut its dividend by two-thirds and suspended share buybacks to protect its balance sheet. It also announced that the head of its investment bank and chief risk officer are both leaving the firm, though its CEO will stay on. In addition, it unloaded another $2.3B worth of stocks tied to Archegos on Monday. While analysts have been fairly quick to dismiss the systemic risks from the Archegos implosion, there have been concerns that the episode could ultimately lead prime brokers to implement more stringent capital requirements and dial back on credit availability, exacerbating thin liquidity conditions.

mlt6ne,,stocks,post,1617766005,"Is Inflation Making a Comeback?**By** [**Fernando Martin**](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/martin/sel/)**, Research Officer and Economist**

[https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback)  


The average price level dropped sharply during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and has gradually recovered since then. As a result, annual inflation has remained low:

* The 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index reached 0.5% in April 2020, its smallest increase that year.
* Core PCE inflation (which excludes food and energy) registered 0.9% in the same month.

Since then, both measures have remained well below the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual inflation target.

## Recent Trends in Inflation

By January, both PCE and core PCE price indexes were back to their pre-COVID-19 trends. This suggests an interesting exercise: Assuming prices remain on trend, what will inflation be in 2021? We can think of this exercise as informing us of the “mechanical” inflation resulting from things returning to normal.

The figure below shows actual PCE inflation and projected inflation for the remainder of the year.[1](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) I projected inflation by taking the PCE price index from 2015 to 2019 and projecting it onward, and then calculated future inflation as the growth rate between the projected index and the *actual* price index from 12 months prior.

As we can see, these estimates project annual inflation above 2% for three months (March, April and May) and converging back to the pre-pandemic average towards the end of the year.

Given the new framework for monetary policy adopted last August, this temporary and mild rise of inflation would be consistent with the Fed’s objective, stated as “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”[2](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) In other words, we should not expect the Fed to react to this temporary rise in inflation.

## Inflation Hints from Other Macroeconomic Variables

The exercise I conducted assumes prices will follow their pre-pandemic trend. However, the pandemic and the policies implemented to combat it have significantly altered the economic landscape. Might these changes imply even higher inflation?

The following series of figures display several key macroeconomic variables, which articulate various views on inflation. All these variables suggest the presence of further inflationary pressures.

### Inflation Expectations

We can think of inflation as a self-fulfilling prophecy where actual inflation depends on expected inflation. This view is shared by many central banks to explain long-run inflation. In this view, a successful central bank anchors inflation expectations around its target for inflation. The figure below shows one measure of expected inflation: the difference in the annual yields of five-year Treasury notes and five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).[3](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/BO7JvJ8

According to this measure, expectations about future inflation have been rapidly accelerating. This may be due in part to the adoption of the new monetary policy framework, as the market now understands that the Fed will let inflation temporarily rise above a 2% annual rate to make up for lost ground. However, it is a variable that deserves close monitoring, especially if it goes significantly above the Fed’s target.

### Unemployment

The so-called Phillips curve states a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The theory—popular among central banks—leads one to expect higher (lower) inflation as the economy strengthens (weakens). As such, it is mostly used to explain cyclical variations in inflation around some long-run value.

The next figure shows two measures of unemployment:

* The official unemployment rate
* The U-6 rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force or employed part time for economic reasons



https://imgur.com/a/UEXkJyo

Both measures have recovered significantly but remain elevated relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. If the economy continues its strong recovery, unemployment is expected to fall even further, which would imply inflationary pressures.

Note, however, that the empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment has diminished significantly in recent years—if not altogether disappeared—and may not be relevant for the current episode, just as it was not during the previous recession.[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)

### Monetary Aggregates

Monetarism is the theory that relates the price level to some monetary aggregate (e.g., currency) and inflation to the growth rate of monetary aggregates. In a modern economy, currency accounts for a small fraction of transactions, so economists look at “broader” monetary aggregates. The figure below shows two such aggregates (M2 and MZM), which both grew significantly between February and May 2020.[5](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/S3t7vhG

These increases coincided with the rise in personal savings during the same period, as households not only received substantial transfers from the federal government but also found it difficult to spend as they normally would.[6](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) These additional savings likely imply a surge in the demand for goods and services as the economy returns back to normal, which would put upward pressure on prices.

How much prices increase due to this pent-up demand will also depend on how nimble supply is, and there are good reasons to believe that the recovery in supply may trail demand. Regardless, as evidenced in the chart, this channel would likely have a temporary (rather than permanent) effect on inflation.

### Federal Debt

Various theories link prices or inflation to the level of debt and expected future fiscal surpluses. Though their mechanisms vary, they all predict higher prices or inflation as debt rises. The final figure shows the federal debt in the hands of the public (net of Fed holdings), which rose significantly between March and June 2020.



https://imgur.com/a/LHUcqH4

As with monetary aggregates, debt increased sharply in level, but its growth rate afterward remains roughly the same. As such, the effects, if any, will materialize as a temporary increase in inflation. However, note that current projections estimate deficits to remain large and growing as a fraction of the economy.[7](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) This trend may put additional pressures on future inflation.

## Conclusion

In the coming months, it is likely that inflation will rise above 2% on an annual basis for a few months. We should neither be surprised nor expect the Fed to react.

However, several reasons point to further inflationary pressures. If these pressures materialize and prove persistent, the Fed will have to eventually step in to lower inflation and achieve its goal of 2% average inflation.

On the other hand, inflation may fail to materialize—as it has in the past—and instead return to its pre-pandemic average. In such a case, the Fed will face a choice: either continue to tolerate persistently undershooting its own target or adopt policies to deliberately raise inflation.

If you plan on sticking to that, I don't know if it's necessarily the way to go to switch them all to FZROX. I was looking at the expense ratios of yours, and they're pretty low. I know things add up, but it's worth doing back-of-the-napkin math to see how much that would cost you eventually.

For nost of the advice I have seen regarding expense ratios, it's usually in the order of 0.015% vs 2.3% or something like that, not 0.015% to 0%.

Also, this is all considering these are in your Roth IRA so transactions should not incur any tax events, if my understanding is correct (a reminder to take all online opinions, anonymous or not, with a grain of salt).

Brk.b traded today at $260-263.35

EDIT UPDATE:

Called them this morning. They didn’t even answer the phone during their posted business hours. Just adds the the amazing service this company provides. 

After calling the number for the old platform holders, and nearly 25mins on hold, they found a person for me to speak with.

I described the problem and the representative n the phone seemed like this was normal at first. She then had a light bulb go off and remembered they had an internal email she quickly glossed over that discussed this issue. She asked me to hold so she could review it again. 

Apparently there was an error on the new platform that didn’t perform the sell orders correctly. They were suppose to sell at $262.276.

I asked when, if, they would be correcting this and if they planned to notify the customers. They said that they were in the process of correcting the error but never notified the customers of the issue(wonderful, thanks). 

I guess it also takes 10 days after the sell date, to receive my money. Also, she confirmed they still don’t sell fractional shares. 

I plan to no longer use them, but leave the remaining 1.5 shares or so that’s left in there, forever.

Fundamentals are improving but still just stuck! NOK appears to be taking major market share from Huawei and has projects on tap with the US DOD etc... Just seams like momentum should be shifting. What in the world am I missing on this one?


Nokia (NOK) is a stock many investors are watching right now. NOK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.26. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.41. Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.35, with a median of 15.63.

Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 0.9. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.67.

These are just a handful of the figures considered in Nokia's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that NOK is an impressive value stock right now.","['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'VZ']"

mlspi7,,stocks,post,1617764375,"US vs. International, Stocks/ ETFs vs. Bonds... help me understand performance chasing here First off... i KNOW i cant predict the market which is why i no longer hold any ETFs and only hold ETFs. 

For reference my current portfolio is

VTI- 57.5%

SCHD-10%

QQQM- 10% (aka QQQ)

SCHF- 10% (International)

QQQJ- 7.5%

VWO- 5% (International emerging market)

But if the US has consistently out performed the International for 120 years (a statement from another post...) are you really going to allocate 20-40% of your portfolio just as a what if? I dont understand the thats performance chasing when a fund has consistently out performed (its not like we are suggesting ARK which had one killer year...). How is it performance chasing to buy into US market when it is consistently a few % higher return? Are you really going to allocate 20-40% of your portfolio to a lower % return in hopes that one or two of those years it does better? What about the other years where us out performs again? Are you going to wish you had such a high weight International? Definitely not. I have 15% to International right now and SERIOUSLY struggle with it. 

I struggle with this when people say QQQ is performance chasing... QQQ has out performed VTI/ VT for the last 10+ years by usually a large amount. Why wouldnt you invest at least a small % in that? Sure tech isnt going to run like 2020 but itll still run consistently for many years. Even after this correction we just had QQQ is performing like its old self. 

Then VTI vs. SCHD.... this one i can see the performance chasing aspect cause its only outperformed VTI for 3 years but has outperformed VT for 5+ (no further back data on etf.com). 

I struggle with this and bonds too... take a fund like BND which many hold/ recommend. VTI has performed 3x-5x it depending on the year. I get that some use this as a play so the money is in the market and lower risk of losing money as they get older so that if they need to pull it they can hopefully be green. But whats the point of taking a risk (especially in 2021) of taking the risk of investing in the bond market which could do something crazy and go negative for a measily 2% return? 

I wanna learn and understand but like i said i feel like the well you cant predict the market or you are performance chasing is super hypocritical and is used to make sense of holdings International. Maybe im just naive? If we cant use the 10+ years of performance as a benchmark what are we supposed to use?",

The difference is that they put more emphasis on comfort, rather than on the 0-60 acceleration. Where are you going to use it?

Do you set stop losses to sell every share? Or do you set the stop loss to sell just the profit you've made and keep your initial investment intact?",

For sure there are some times you get stop hunted, but it prevents you from a much bigger potential loss. But if you can't do TA or do not plan to do swing trading, then you might just want to set a trailing stop to take profit or loss, if it hit it hit, you just admit defeat or take profit. If you are investing blue chip stocks and can wait out a bear market, then you don't need stops. I personally cannot tolerate getting stuck in a losing trade",['QCOM']
mlbjdv,,stocks,post,1617715344,"What are your highest conviction picksSo it's simple what's your highest conviction stocks


So to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever
Here's why I like these in short

So I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but also this is a diversified business and it's growing YoY.
Google and Facebook are one of the best in the world the advertising business is growing strong every year and there's no sign this will stop also they are entering other industrys
With Amazon it's another beast who's entering other industries all the time there cloud computing is growing strong and there advertising business are also growing.
With Unilever I like this because over 2 billion people use their products every day and it's growing in emarging markets.


I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.

Here's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them
So with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the ""lost decade"" he averaged 14% return every year.
He also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.
With the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.
Finally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure

Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations

So what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?","['ARKK', 'ADBE', 'FB', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL', 'BRK.B']"

I opened up a Roth IRA and maxed it out, is it best to do this every year, then a taxable account for an additional amount? I just have ETF’s in the s and p 1500, slow and steady. I’m 31, so I’d like to think I have time on my side still. 

For 2020, The taxes on the brokerage account didn’t seem bad at all, just on the dividends. The account was up somewhere around $700, but since I didn’t cash it out...the dividends I owed tax on was only around $60. That doesn’t seem bad? I figure the more I owe in taxes, that just means the balance is going up?

I’d appreciate any advice! 

Just curious, why is there a small limit to the Roth IRA Max? They don’t want people having too much money tax free? Lol

I went with the one I chose since I know more about the companies, but am considering changing to one of the other ETFs to see how it goes.

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities rallied Monday with S&P 500 and Dow both setting new record closes. Growth outperformed value, though both factors saw good gains. Consumer discretionary was the leader with travel and leisure names faring well. Communications services performed well with FB and GOOGL strength. Tech was boosted by AAPL and MSFT. Energy was the only sector lower on the day. Treasuries were mostly firmer led by the five year point of the curve after rates saw some upward pressure on Good Friday when equities were closed. 10s finished above 1.70% again. Dollar weakened vs both yen and euro. Gold finished fractionally higher. WTI crude ended down 4.6%.
   * **Market was largely supported by combination of upbeat recovery sentiment following better March employment data and fairly well behaved bond yields**. Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K, well above the 660K consensus, while net upward revisions to prior months totaled 156K. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation, the room for further recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic and the lack of upward pressure on wages. Fits with broader reopening momentum seen in high-frequency indicators surrounding mobility, card spending, air travel and dining out.
   * **ISM services hit record high** in March. **Biden said not worried about a tax increase hurting economy** amid heightened debate about how to best fund infrastructure stimulus. **Manchin reiterated corporate tax rate should settle at 25%**, **not 28%**, and more money should come from high earners. **Yellen said US working with G20 on global minimum tax**. Also called on other nations to avoid pre-emptive fiscal tightening. **US vaccine outperformance continues** with seven-day average of 3M+ doses per day, seemingly overshadowing some concerns about a **potential fourth wave**. Multiple reports discussed **dampened momentum behind retail investors**.
   * **GOOGL** secured favorable ruling from SCOTUS in Android copyright infringement case. **TSLA** Q1 deliveries hit a new record high and beat consensus expectations. **PLTR** boosted by \~$90M NNSW contract. **PINS** has reportedly held talks to acquire photography app VSCO. **PXD** to acquire DoublePoint Energy in a cash and stock deal with an EV of $6.4B. **DAL** forced to cancel \~100 flights due to a staffing shortage. **GME** announced 3.5M share secondary offering. **NVTA** higher on Softbank-led investment. **TPCO** board blessed higher takeover bid. **BVH** announced intent to acquire the 7% of **BXG** it does not already own. **LEAF** to be acquired by **GHC** for $323M in cash.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Most sectors finished higher, with growth groups outperforming:**
      * **Consumer discretionary** led the market with strength from AMZN, auto names, and travel/leisure names (NCLH submitted plans to CDC for cruise resumptions). The megacap internets were stronger in **communication services**. MSFT and AAPL helped boost **tech**, with the semi space mostly higher as well. **Consumer staples** were a touch behind on food losses though good gains among drug stores, grocers, and beverages. **Industrials** trailed a bit though transports, A&D, and multis performed well. **Materials** **lagged somewhat with packaging performing well while precious metal miners lagged. Financials** lagged with banks mixed and tech lending lower. **Healthcare** was a relative underperformer. MedTech stocks were generally better but there was some scattered weakness in biotech and pharma. **Energy** was the only sector lower, with E&Ps and oil-services firms weaker alongside crude oil.
   * **Big beat for March payrolls:**
      * Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K in March, the biggest gain since last August and well above the 660K consensus. In addition, the net upward revision to prior months totaled 156K. The unemployment rate fell by 0.2pp to 6.0%, in line with expectations. Household employment increased 609K, the participation rate rose 0.1pp to 61.5% and the employment-population ratio increased 0.2pp to 57.8%. Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% m/m vs expectations for a 0.1% gain, with compositional changes flagged as an overhang. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation (Goldman Sachs said industry breadth hit a 9-month high) and the further room for recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic. There was some discussion about a return to the pre-pandemic level of jobs by year-end.
   * **ISM non-manufacturing index posted record high:**
      * **ISM non-manufacturing index** for March soared to 63.7, beating 58.5 estimate and up from prior month 55.3. Highest reading in series history (from 1997). Business activity index up 13.9 at 69.4, new orders index up 15.3 at 67.2, employment index up 4.5 at 57.2. Prices index rose 2.2 to 74. Respondents noted lifting of Covid restrictions has unleashed pent-up demand while capacity constraints remain a challenge. Elsewhere, March **Markit services PMI** at 60.4, up 0.4% from flash; above Feb's 59.8. Highest since Jul-14. New orders, input, output cost series up sharply. Production, employment, expectations also rose.

I think $15.75ish is a pessimistic valuation with upside to $24-$30 depending how earnings play out post COVID and whether the new customers fade or keep buying.

mllvef,,stocks,post,1617743549,"Question Regarding Investments For Young InvestorsHello!  


I have been struggling a lot recently regarding my portfolio composition. As I am a young and inexperienced investor, I always invested in index funds. However, I recently transitioned a majority of my portfolio towards thematic investments in eSports/Disruptive Innovation and other speculative investments because I learned that I should be more risk-loving given my young age. However, I understand that I am subject to increased volatility during market downturns. My portfolio is roughly 80%+ in speculative/technology. Is this a naïve thought process and should I transition my portfolio to increase diversification? I'd love to hear your thoughts! Thanks so much!",
mllvef,gtmbms7,stocks,comment,1617746035,"I think you've learned you should take risks, and you've really embraced that, but I think this is fairly reckless. You should still have some balance to your portfolio, it's just that maybe you don't need bonds, not that you should have most of your portfolio in high risk stocks. 

&#x200B;

Something that is often missed about younger investors is that capital preservation is key, because of the power of compounding. Yeah, you can 2000% if you get lucky and time it right, but you could just as easily lose 50%, and then you have to double your money just to get back to where you were. If you can make 10%+ over 30, 40 years, you'll retire a multi-millionaire most likely, and you really don't have to take crazy risks for that. 

&#x200B;

Innovation, including e-sports... There's a lot of hype, stupid valuations and unproven businesses in that sector. Even if your investments are profitable, it's plausible your opportunity cost is great. 

&#x200B;

It might be worth setting some goals. For example, I have 5% put aside for speculative investments, and my aim is to have 70% of my holdings in solid companies (these range from JNJ to MSFT - basically stable companies with solid track records and decent growth), and then 15% in higher risk (of which 1/3 of that speculative) and 15% in low risk, think AT&T, National Grid, etc. Perhaps cap yourself to no more than say 8% in one company - especially until you're really confident - and 25% in one sector. I'm in my early 30s and also new, plus I'm playing with not just my money but my wife's, so being careful... Tweak those numbers how you see fit, but it's good to have an honest review of your portfolio IMO. 

&#x200B;

Also within those sectors, ask why you are owning a stock. If you can't give a 60 second summary to your mother, look for an exit. Have an idea of your buy in, your sale point, is it a turnaround or a value play or etc. Understand the numbers likewise and do some due diligence.

mllvef,gtmaxpr,stocks,comment,1617745704,"You can be risk loving with index funds, 100% into VTI is pretty high risk compared with a portfolio of 80% stocks/20% bonds.

But you should be aware that higher risk does not always correlate with higher returns because not everything is a *priced* risk. For example, if you yolo all your money onto one stock, that is a lot of risk, but *on average* you would not expect higher returns than the market, because it is not a *priced* risk (what makes something a priced risk is a bit complicated that I wont get into). Of course, it might go up significantly more than the market, but you dont know, you might as well go put it all on black, that's high risk as well and if it hits you've certainly beaten the market. High risk high reward right?

If you are going to pick stocks, stick to things you *know*, where you have an advantage. Do you work for Domino's and have been seeing sales skyrocket recently?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

mkszp8,,stocks,post,1617651612,"Dow, S&P 500 rally to records, boosted by strong economic data 

NEW YORK  (Reuters) -     U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, as a round of strong  economic data on the labor market and services sector buoyed investor  optimism for the economic reopening and a muted climb in the 10-year  U.S. Treasury yield kept inflation worries at bay.

An ISM survey for March showed a measure of U.S. services industry  activity jumped to a record high. The data followed Friday's report  showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs in March, trouncing  forecasts.  

Investors have bet on sectors poised to lead an economic reopening,  such as energy, financials and materials. A climbing yield on the  10-year U.S. Treasury note has dented appetite for technology stocks. 

Despite strong economic data, gains were led by sectors that have  underperformed recently, including communication services, consumer  discretionary and tech, as the 10-year yield remained below a 14-month  high hit last week.  

""One of the fears in March was that the rise in rates meant you need to take multiples down,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 

""It's not the reopening trade at this point, it is higher interest  rates are here but not accelerating so the whole economy is being  lifted."" 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 385.96 points, or 1.16%, to  33,539.17, the S&P 500 gained 59.11 points, or 1.47%, to 4,078.98  and the Nasdaq Composite added 234.78 points, or 1.74%, to 13,714.89.

With speedy vaccinations and additional government stimulus helping  the S&P 500 and the Dow clinch all-time highs, focus now turns to  progress on a massive infrastructure plan and the upcoming corporate  earnings season.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still about 4% below its February high as  the recent spike in bond yields spurred inflation concerns and made  growth stocks less attractive.

Energy shares were the worst performing sector, following a sharp  drop in oil prices. Reopening plays gained, as the S&P 1500 airlines  index jumped 3.43% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk."" The  agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all  non-essential trips.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was  working with G20 countries to agree on a global corporate minimum tax  rate to end a ""30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.""","['SPGI', 'DOW', 'NDAQ']"

Little did I know there would be an inexplicable crash after a great Q4 earnings, a tech overvaluation with an industry rotation, etc. I was up 50% at one point *very early* on in my option (within days), decided to hold for a month instead, and ended up realizing a 90% loss.

BABA - Various calls and puts after the drop from 300 back in Nov 2019.

What I didn't *appreciate* properly was that the FUD surrounding BABA would far outweigh the fundamentals at least in the ""short term"" and not the other way around. I thought BABA found support after the initial drop from 320 to 250 in a 2 weeks timespan. Boy was I wrong. The FUD was just beginning and it's still going on.

RGDP is real output = income in an economy, so she's right that tech is hugely deflationary and has probably been the main driver that's pushed interest rates to low levels.

Inflation, on the other hand, can be fully determined by monetary policy absent supply shocks. Notice how we've not had significant supply shocks since the oil shocks, mainly because technology has improved our supply chains so that thing don't get bottlenecked anymore. This implies that inflation is neither determined by growth nor by technology, but by the Fed. If they see signs that NGDP picks up higher than RGDP for extended time (nominal income outpaces real income, or more money chasing goods not being produced with fast enough technological progress) then they tighten policy and vice versa. The nature of the technology, whether it's textile mills or supercomputers, is irrelevant.

Inflation numbers, whether you look at PPI or CPI or PCE or the GDP deflator or independent measures like billion prices project, all fall roughly in line, suggesting there's no systematic, artificial revision upwards or downwards.

mk9aak,,stocks,post,1617584936,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 yearsThe U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

Specifically my question for those actively engaged in the markets at that time I was wondering if anyone A) strategically sold everything i.e. went fully in cash (or equivalent) and based on which events and how did your timing work with markets up for much longer, B) how did you plan your re-entry and based on which events and when, C) what would you do different next time in hindsight how the events unfolded?

For myself I was too busy with work to notice, even after the first places in China and Italy went into full lockdown and dismissed it as a ""flu"".

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) can be an income machine for stimulus check recipients at $30 per share

For example, the rollout of 5G networks should be a significant positive for AT&T. It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.


AT&T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months. This may have to do with subsidiary WarnerMedia releasing all of its movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they'll hit theaters.","['CMCSA', 'AMP']"

mktwex,,stocks,post,1617654022,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.""We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

ml1uvi,gtjgc27,stocks,comment,1617687180,"I can see the rationale behind the growth patterns.

Those with the highest influence on the profit margins will grow faster than those without.  This may be due to customers having a hands-on feel for the product, visual cues, as well as easier to market and develop from an end-user's perspective (you already know what they are going to do, so can tailor it exclusively towards that).

DevOps, CDN, and Cybersecurity are all expenses with no direct relation to the profitability of a company.  DevOps and CDN help development, but unfortunately the customers who do buy these tend to be more business oriented and think ""they are developers, they should be doing this anyways.  We don't need this since this doesn't drive profits.  Make dev work easier?  What do I pay you for?""  And cybersecurity is similar however it only crops up when breaches happen and people hear about it.  If no one hears about it, then did a breach really happen?  So most try to find the solution that is ""just good enough"" without hurting their bottom line.

Marketplace is the outlier here, as it's neither a cost or profit driven motive.  It's like an eBay of sorts, but it also depends on how it's monetized and utilized by it's users.  More users = more traffic.  More monetization can lead to higher profits and/or less users.  So like Social Networks, it needs to build a user base before it can monetize.  However it has additional leg work to do depending on what type of goods it's attempting to sell and the Marketplace not being user driven (compared to Social Networks).","['EBAY', 'LEG']"

Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

I need advice and some serious talk.

I am currently sitting on a portfolio of

\- 45% ETF´s  
\- 40% high dividend stocks and reits and such

rest in individual stocks I picked and liked.

I want more growth as I want to reduce the time I need to get to a certain threshold.

I picked the dividend stocks mainly because of the high yield. the lowest yield I get is 4,5%. highest at 13,4%.

I know that

\- those high yields are probably not lasting forever

\- I miss out on growth of the actual securities

but also , ALL dividend securities are green since I bought them.

the lowest being +1,51% (OMF), the highest being 42,88% (OKE).  
the rest is between 8,7% 27,09% green.

what should I do ? sell at green, take the tax hit (which is about 25% of profits where I live -> germany)  
or keep those titles ?

currently I reinvest every dividend payout I get. but those also take a tax hit. so I am missing out on returns and not even benefitting from the full dividend payout...

I am open for all kinds of tips and suggestions.",['OKE']
mlzyon,,investing,post,1617794893,"Investing: the future winners among car manufacturers and your opinionGreetings! I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

VW has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, Frank Walliser, at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

|COMPANY|COUNTRY|P/E RATE|RETURN SO FAR 2021|RETURN 1 YEAR|MARKET VALUE (BILLION USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Toyota Motor Corp**|JPN|10|4 %|39 %|249|
|**Bayerische Motoren Werke AG**|GER|9|16 %|120 %|65|

* BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, etc. are luxury brands that aren't going anywhere but also aren't likely to be major movers in the transition. Their value is tied more to their brand than market share so I'm not particularly interested in them right now. Probably safe but not super exciting.

Some highlights: 

[Dimon's discussion of corporate citizenship](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#corporate-citizen)

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

>1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

But I kind of feel like he is right. We've already seen, over and over, what kind of damage banks can do when we leave them to their own devices--and that is with regulation. But an increasing amount of systemic risk is now taking place outside of those regulations.

Take a recent topic of a lot of discussion: Coinbase. As of their December reporting, they had over 90B of customer assets, which would have put them in the top 40 banks. I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming a new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are regulated.

The Crypto Council for Innovation will lobby policy makers, take up research projects and serve as the burgeoning industry’s voice in championing the economic benefits of digital currencies and related technologies. Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

The council’s launch comes as prices of many digital assets have surged, drawing in new mainstream investors and the banks and brokers that serve them. Earlier this year, the total market value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, touched $1 trillion for the first time.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

“Crypto is at a mainstream inflection point,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Paradigm and Coinbase’s former president. “It’s in its very early stages and, much like the internet (once was), it’s very fragile while it’s in that stage.”

The internet emerged as a major force in global commerce in part because of a handful of key policy decisions, including those that legalized data encryption and resolved questions over sales taxes, Mr. Ehrsam said. The nascent cryptocurrency market is sure to face its own crossroads, even if it isn’t yet obvious what they are, he said.

“It’s challenging because policy makers want to balance risk and reward, and even people who spend time in this space would struggle to predict where this will go in the coming decade,” he said. “It was very hard to say where the internet was going to go.”

The council plans to appoint a board that would include representatives with each of the four initial members. In time, Mr. Ehrsam said, the group will add an executive team.

Mr. Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang founded Paradigm three years ago to invest in both cryptocurrencies and the companies that focus on that market.

Fidelity, an investing colossus with nearly $10 trillion in client assets under administration, opened in 2018 a custody business that stores and trades bitcoin for hedge funds and other professional investors. Last month, the Boston firm became the latest money manager to seek regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.

Square, an electronic-payments company, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. And the firm’s Cash App consumer-finance platform allows users to buy and sell the digital currency.

Coinbase, founded in 2012, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. The company, which serves 43 million customers in 100 countries, plans to go public later this month.",

Thoughts on space tech as an investment?

The Offering was made through a syndicate of underwriters led by BMO Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley Canada Limited and Scotiabank, as joint bookrunners, with Barclays Capital Canada Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Canaccord Genuity Corp., CIBC World Markets Inc., National Bank Financial Inc. and Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., as underwriters. 

With over 60 years of space innovation in Canada and a government injection of over 2 Billion dollars Canada has been making serious space news. Today MDA who is the largest benefactor of that investment finalized its initial public offer at $14 per share.

The timing bodes well for MDA as the company has also been active in creating jobs and opportunities for the growing earth observation market. It was [announced](https://techbomb.ca/aerospace/government-of-canada-launches-international-space-program-to-track-illegal-fishing/) last month that the Government of Canada intends to launch an international space program to track illegal fishing. MDA is a key partner providing data from its partnership in the Radarsat program.

>  
>  
**Verified Users of 56 million**  
Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) of 6.1 million

Trading Volume of $335 billion  
**Total Revenue of approximately $1.8 billion**  
**Net Income of approximately $730 million to $800 million**  
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Crazy.

mm45l7,,investing,post,1617807980,"Drive Shack, the reopening play you never heard of**General Overview:**

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

**My Holdings**: 150 shares as of right now

**FINAL TLDR:** *The company has a lot of potential for growth. It's worth the effort of looking into them ahead of earnings in early May.*",['IR']

mkzjy4,gtisvs8,investing,comment,1617672980,"I think you're comparing apples to oranges here in a sense. 

First, Real Estate is not a liquid asset like your stocks.  It's something you put into a (likely) minimum 5-10yr time-frame with regards to financial analysis. 

Secondly, you own the entire thing. This is not shares in a company that you have no control over. Your DD on buying a property should be way higher than DD on a stock. You should know the neighborhood and know the risks and be willing to take them.  You should be fiddling with pro-formas constantly to decide if a property works for you. If it doesn't then don't do it.  Also, people forget while there is an advantage to leverage, YOU can decide how much you leverage. If you want to have a 50% leverage to feel safer and have a better cash-flow, then you can. Nothing stops you from doing that. 

RE is a great hedge against inflation. Your cost for money stays static mostly, while inflation goes up and so do your rents and so does the value of your asset. In the same vein you're taking tax breaks on deflation and other expenses. 

Of course your stocks won't call you at 3am on a weeknight letting you know that the water heater has exploded in the garage :) 

Lastly, all your ""what ifs"" apply equally if not more to any stock. What if there's a global pandemic and my airline holdings can't fly anyone. Would you have predicted no one would be watching movies in theaters for 9-12 months? There is inherent risk in any investment, but with RE you're more likely to have a long-term glacial change than rapid fluctuation.",

Weird thing about property, one of the only times banks will loan big money to average Joe.  Real estate makes more millionaires then any industry.  It’s because people can get leverage easily.  The house is collateral.  It’s rare a property drops to $0 or even 50% quickly.  But like any investment, requires you to do your homework.

Don’t buy a cheap single family home in a questionable town that’s supports the coal industry in bumblefuck nowhere with multiple fracking sites within a couple miles.  Then act surprised the town is becoming vacant or there is pollution in the ground water.

Do buy a duplex in a town undergoing gentrification.  It sounds like a joke, but look for where new Micro Breweries are going up.  It’s the trendy shit that puts your town on the map.

Initial support is touted in the 3975-to-4000 zone, the firm added.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

""Although we expect near-term volatility as 1Q earnings start on April 14, reflecting weak loan growth, margin pressure, lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonal factors, we remain positive on the bank group,"" Wedbush said.

Technology stocks, were roughly unchanged, with the fab 5 trading mixed, even as falling U.S. bond yields supported investor sentiment on longer-duration growth stocks.  

The U.S. 10-year slipped below 1.7% quote yields after trading in range of 1.67% to 1.72% in recent days. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was higher.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) struggled to get going after racking up a 6% gain on Monday, as investors digested a bearish note from Roth Capital.

Roth Capital said Tesla is only worth $150 a share and suggested the electric automaker was a ""minor player"" in the U.S. and European markets.","['APA', 'FANG', 'STT', 'AAPL', 'BK', 'FB', 'NDAQ', 'SPGI', 'AMZN', 'DVN', 'DOW', 'MSFT', 'PNC', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL']"

mla9be,,investing,post,1617711303,"DD on fundamentals and growth of Super League Gaming $SLGGFrom user u/whobangin

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.  


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5c7pfn1qgr61.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02a6df6d2de3a51a0842765b61cde1f361d748e

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",['AMP']

mla9be,gtlkq3b,investing,comment,1617734115,"Sorry man, I don’t think this is it. I bought GME starting in 2018, and it’s a totally different game. Really quick difference:
GME was operating cash flow +$300-$500M on a yearly basis. Their market cap when it was a good buy was $250-$500M. In other word buying GME, $1 invested would return $1 or more per year in cash flow. the market was over 100% short on a cash flow positive firm. Also, WSB is only partially the reason for the event. What really caused it was the over 90% ownership by firms such as vanguard and black rock, which allowed for a very illiquid market.
These are 2 different things.. 
Wall Street got caught shorting a cash flow positive firm during the cyclical console cycle transition. 
This on the other hand is a gamble, with very little safety of principal compared to pre winter 2020, GME purchases. 
That being said it could always go up, but if you want to hold it 10 years, having reasonable expectations would allow you to do that and succeed",

My 30-something daughter is just now starting to invest as she has advanced in her career and is making good money. Well, I think she got her first lesson in investing: Don't believe the hype. She bought FPWM at $4-something. Just 100 shares so it wasn't a lot of money, thankfully. I have no idea where she got that ""tip"". I took a look at it but didn't say a word. What was I going to say? That she bought a stock that had hardly been over .60 per share in 5 years for over $4? She talked to me a few times about how much it was going up and she was really pleased. I put it on my watch list just to see what it did.

Well, it got up to $8 per share and then bam... dropped like a rock. The volume that day was WAY above it's average. It's now under $3.

**Coinbase** - IPOing through a directly listing on April 30th, this is kind of an obvious play. They make a SHIT ton of money and are the King broker in Crypto and the most mainstream with their revenue growing from half a million in 2019 to 1.1 Billion in 2020

**RKT** - The biggest mortgage company in the US, expanding into Canada and looking for a fintech category, they are extremely well positioned to start acquiring other companies and start dipping their toes into other sector of the financial market (car loans, Zillow/Redfin Competitors, etc)

**Roblox** - This is strictly here because they are the amazon of gaming. People are able to make money off of Roblox and that makes it a great growth company, really any company that you can make money off of is suitable for huge growth not to mention their insane money spending crowd of kids

**Disney** - hear me out. Expansion coming for disneyland to build two more parks. Their Disney+ series is only going to get better with more marvel and star wars original content and anyone that is a parent knows how good Disney+ is. Also, once everything opens up they will be making money off theaters + their new movie releases on Disney+ to watch from home. I think they have plenty of growth left.

**Apple** - But apple i already the most valuable company how can they possible be considered a *growth* company at these high valuations. Two words for you ""apple car"" and ""Apple glasses""

**Tesla** - for obvious reasons, self driving, insurance for that self driving, more cars, EV charging expansion, all that good stuff

**RIOT** - literally the only reason this is up here is if you think Bitcoin is going to go higher then so is RIOT. in one year it went from $0.70 to highs of $75.....yup, its trading right now at under $50 i think and can easily hit $100+ as long as BTC keeps moving upwards

And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style& apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming & lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty & Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style & apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming & Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty & Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['WMT', 'GPS', 'CVS', 'CHD', 'NKE']"

ml5nfg,gtjulec,investing,comment,1617700769,"Did not know that Playboy was still around.  It appears to be a shadow of its' former self per Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy\_Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Enterprises).    


March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed  - now completely digital.  No more glossy centerfolds.

It also appears that the adults now own & run the business, Hugh Hefner died in 2017 and his daughter who ran the company from 1988 to 2009 are no longer an issue.  It is also apparent that most of the losing enterprises from Heff's day have been dropped.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises’ had merged with Mountain Crest - a SPAC.  


According to Schwab:     
Canaccord Genuity Initiates PLBY Group at Buy Rating With $28 Price Target

Craig-Hallum raises price target to $35 from $25

Roth Capital raises PLBY Group's Price Target to $26 From $18, Keeps Buy Rating

Also up 19% yesterday and 4% After hours.  

If I were to buy into PLBY would have to see what their Asian operations & casino openings slated for the next 3 years are.  And what the former Asian operations financials were before they closed them down.    


As to their brand/product - to be crass the product is a commodity.   Not sure if it has any cache anymore.  As to hawking other brands: "" Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. "".  Every company that can,  works with (pays extortionate rates for) celebrities which is a tried-and true way of doing business.  Also pretty tired method.   If you need a reminder of celebrity abuse and how useless it is: doughy-faced Tom Bosley of Happy Days TV show fame gave a rousing recommendation for a swindlers failed investment scheme. 

*On buying sentiment:*   
PLBY has a former reputation to live down, using celebrities to pitch their brand (at very best neutral rating),  their product is barely distinguishable from other brands,  and ""Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals \[like 50% of the population - women\] – ..... I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women"" - this could be insurmountable.   


Seeing the Penthouse Magazine in its' heyday and what it is now and comparing it to PLBY is kind of the flightplan I see for PLBY.  Went from being misogynistic and vapid to totally vapid.  


***In total - good OP analysis of the positive points but PLBY has some serious perception drawbacks.***  


Think PLBY is a sell for the immediate future not a buy particularly given the runup yesterday and last night.  PLBY is still in their first year of a shakedown cruise  trying to see what works with todays clients.   More distance will have to be put between the past and what they are currently going to do to make money.  Also only time will tell if their new clients gained during the pandemic are sticky or flaky (Jesus that has unintended under/overtones).  The cache of going to a Playboy mansion is dead.  Celebrity endorsement is a big bucket of who cares.  But in 5 years - with a considerable amount of re-branding, some outstanding PR, and dropping of certain lines of business - they could make a go of it.    


But then again, I could be hopelessly out of date.  PLBY could be a total surprise.  For me, it is a pass since it has ""faddish and transitory"" stamped in big letters all over it.  Rather like cigarette stocks; except cigarette stocks pay a dividend.  Maybe PLBY is more of a day trade or swing trade.  Definitely not a buy and hold for me.  


***To the OP: good analysis of the positive side of PLBY.  Think you could very successfully write their promotional material for them.  Look forward to seeing your next DD analysis.  If this post is any indicator you are good at this.***",['BEN']
mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",['TSLA']

I have a large sum to invest (partly inheritance) ie around 0.5m . I have some experience of investing, but not a lot, and the recent increase in my portfolio means there's now a lot more to lose.

I don't really need the money as income (have other sources), so what I want to do is invest it for long term (30 years or so) and may not touch it before I die, and pass it on. 

I would like to grow it as much as possible, and of course not lose it.

So my thinking is index funds. I have to accept that I am not educated enough in finance, and probably not smart enough to get sufficiently educated, to be able to do successful stock picking, much as I would like to. I also don't trust a third party to manage the money fairly or well (not saying my lack of trust is justified, just that I have it).

So then the question is - which index funds?

Although people often suggest that index investing is a simple activity, I would have thought it matters greatly which index you pick.

So my questions are:

- Should I pick an S&P 500 index, even though the P/E ratio looks very much on the high side?

- Should I pick something like the British FTSE 100, which is thought to be undervalued at the moment? And then maybe come back to S&P 500 later?

- Should I choose an emerging markets ETF?

- Or stay in cash until S&P 500 cools down a bit?


I would certainly want to get more than inflation, and more than bonds would give me. I'm happy to sit through ups and downs, I just feel like the decision I make at this point is going to have long-reaching ramifications on my final portfolio.

mjwo8q,,investing,post,1617544552,"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policiesThe waste industry is more than just hard-working gentlemen and women collecting trash from your home or business. It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

If that is the case, these vertically integrated multistate operators (MSOs) will have get a bigger and bigger market share as time goes on. The sooner federal legalization happens, the sooner they can lose market share to opposition (Canadian companies, big tobacco, etc). But because weed is federally illegal, they can't be listed on the NYSE. Being an OTC stock means less hedge funds and big whales invested in these highly profitable companies. Federal legalization can lead the way for them to up-list. Hopefully seeing a boost.

As for Curaleaf, they recently saw their bump because of NY legalizing weed. As well as Green Thumb, Cresco, and many other northeast operators. Additionally, Curaleaf has one of the highest market caps of them all with the most share dilution. It'll take big money to drive the price higher and higher. They can lag relative to their industry peers.",

""This may be surprising for some,but I’m going to try to explain why in my opinion this is an undervalued,and misunderstood company. First you have to understand southern car culture. There isn’t a lot to do in the southern states,and middle america. This results in most people pouring money into their cars as one of their main hobbies. My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth. They are rapidly taking over the aftermarket part market through acquisitions. Including expanding into the aftermarket EV car market. In my opinion this is a low risk - medium to high return trade.""

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['GOOGL', 'NOV']"

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

mijlje,,investing,post,1617367458,"U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.",

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

Wanted to post this as a specific thread, but I don't have the Karma :(. If someone is interested and has enough fake internet currency, please do.","['CMI', 'DOW']"

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k).

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality.

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",
mj2qmk,gt9lulr,investing,comment,1617472924,"I'm not an expert by any means, but maybe I can help you examine this in some more detail because on the surface this does look interesting.

Most of my gold mining knowledge (which is not much) comes from my time working as a land surveyor [in Colorado gold country.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B047'33.2%22N+105%C2%B031'33.3%22W/@39.792556,-105.5281017,700m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d39.7925558!4d-105.5259125) All those piles of brown from there all the way south and west beyond Idaho Springs are tailings, and there's still gold up in them there mountains. From what I understand, this stuff is exactly what this company would be targeting for processing, but currently the tailings in CO are just being sat on until gold reaches a threshold price where the owner will then start processing the tailings at a profit. I don't know what that threshold is but it hasn't happened yet and there hasn't been activity here since the early 1980s.

So my questions, and these are intended to dig a little deeper, maybe think about things from a different angle and stress test your bullish hypothesis, I'm not trying to shit on your DD or anything: 

1.  Are they purely a tailings-processing company now or do they also operate traditional mines? Looks like purely tailings now, but you also mentioned looking at surface mining internationally in the future.
2. What are their current reserves? Do they have enough tailings in SA to keep them busy at current levels until 2023? 2025? 2030? Their plan seems to be focused on SA until 2026 so I'm trying to get at the scale of revenue and earnings growth for the next 5 years here. Basically if they stay in SA the jump they saw in 2020 may plateau once they hit full operating capacity until they scale up internationally.
3. Specifically related to gold tailings, are the tailings in South Africa more concentrated? Or is DRD's process more cost-effective than traditional processing and allows them to profitably process tailings at a lower price of gold? If their process is significantly and demonstrably more cost-effective then that could be a big disruptive factor for the company. If it's just that the tailings in SA are better quality, then I'm more skeptical.
4. What was the investment required to build the processing plant? And if they expand internationally, will they have to build plants locally, work with local companies (sort of leasing their process), or ship the tailings to their SA plant?
5. Has processing platinum tailings begun? If so when did it begin or if not when is it expected to begin?
6. If platinum isn't up and running, there's more risk inherent there in that case. What is the difference between gold tailings and platinum tailings? Is it a similar process (using the same methods and chemicals) or is it significantly different? Can we expect similar margins from this as the gold?
7. What's their competition here? What other companies are in the gold/platinum tailings processing space?

I don't expect you'd have all the answers to these questions, but maybe there's some things there to think about.

In short, I'm intrigued. If their processing is indeed more cost-effective than traditional tailings processing, then long term that's potentially a good sign for big growth and big scaling. That would mean a potential disruptive factor within that industry and would provide a good competitive moat/advantage. If the jump is simply related to getting a plant up and running and processing high-quality trailings, then I'd expect the growth to stabilize once platinum is up and running (if it's not already) and they'd be more vulnerable to competition especially once they start trying to scale internationally.",

For some ETFs that saw a huge dip, e.g. ARKK or ARKW, the computed target was close to the historical maximum, so I wonder how much price bias is there in the target price published by analysts (i.e., analysists try to reason current price, rather than coming up with a proper valuation).

I'm going to track this for a while to see how useful this information is.

Edit 1: I explained here how I computed the table: https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mijk9h/i_computed_the_weighted_average_upside_for_100/gt563uy. tl;dr:  ETF's upside is computed from the allocation weighted upside of the individual stocks comprising the ETF.

Edit 2: I added a few more etfs, and I decided to publish the entire doc here for the transparency sake. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR5HjnlzG0EA6wrGmPGZDl9oISgf8ekECzlHUj4zPBW-z-MUH4-N9dwFjOXvD1qcTA29vEoxYT87Unp/pubhtml

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs). Also it doesn't work with non-US listed stocks (e.g. finviz doesn't have data for the ESPO stocks https://stockanalysis.com/etf/espo/holdings/)","['ARKK', 'AAPL']"

mij0s2,,investing,post,1617365319,"ARKK Morningstar review: Unrestrained, Unaware, and Unconcerned[https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist)

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

>New York Attorney General Letitia James' office says it found that Tether sometimes held no reserves to back its cryptocurrency's dollar peg. It said that, from mid-2017, the company had no access to banking and misled clients about liquidity issues.

>In a 2019 filing, the attorney general's office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether's cash reserves to Bitfinex.

>”Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,"" James said in a statement Tuesday.

>”Tether's claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,"" she added.

>”These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.""

**What is tether?**

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

https://assets-bwbx-io.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irp9oaPu51XM/v0/-1x-1.png

**What happens now?**

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

Tether will soon face a quarterly report, filed with the AG, may shed more light on how exactly Tether’s money is invested.

Or it could bring down the price.

People only use tether because it’s the cheapest option for getting  1 dollar US outside of the US. We don’t need it here for obvious reasons. But if Tether crashed people would move into other stable coins USDC and DAI. But there are other complications with that such as supply. 

Fact is nobody knows what will happen if Tether dies. But I do believe it’s a sort of ticking time bomb and something to be wary of. They should definitely be audited by an outside source regularly.",

mig57o,gt7nmuh,investing,comment,1617421308,"Climate change results in catastrophe *only* if it is not managed. We are currently on track for a 3+ deg C increase in average temperature. But efforts are underway to transition to a low-carbon economy and therefore a 2 deg C increase. How much is the investment needed? Around 190 trillion (Edit: 90 trillion) USD by 2030!!

In other words, there are *opportunities* in transition to a green economy, and one that has been enshrined in pledges both by public and private institutions. New energy generation, energy efficiency technology, sustainable practices, increase in carbon price and changing customer demands.

A very obvious one: carbon price. It is expected that carbon price needs to be at around 100 USD/eCO2MT in order to achieve the 2 deg transition. What is the current carbon price now? In Europe (the highest) it is only \~37 EUR! And yet the targeted emission reduction in the next few decades already mandates that there be 7% increase in carbon price per annum!

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

* ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.
* ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.
* HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia
* KRBN: tracks the carbon future price of the European Emission Trading Scheme and that in California. The best performing commodity in 2020, and arguably in the years to come. Unlike other commodities, the fundamental case is quite strong.

-something to haul them with (truck)
-house
-cabin 

I understood that it was a lot, but I figured I’d get a good job and get there one step at a time. 

I recently finished paying off my student debt (50k) four years after college (6 years out now). I lived way below my means to make this happen. Recently, I have gotten into investing and I am very focused on compound interest. I started maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, and also started a brokerage account for additional stocks. I continue to live below my means, and I like it that way. Investing makes me feel fulfilled, like I have a real goal I am working towards. 

When I think about those items mentioned above, I no longer get excited. I see them as mountains of debt. I want to buy a house, but I don’t want to do it in this seller’s market. The other items just seem like unnecessary obstacles to reaching my investment goals. I don’t make enough money to accomplish both.

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people. The thing with the USD is the inflation is pretty predictable, and prices relatively stay the same throughout the years. But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent.

mi3bt3,,investing,post,1617306304,"Micron Soars On Chip Shortage ""Perfect Storm""In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving

mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

> SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m   

Debt and accumulated equity deficit are not the same thing. Debt of a company is the total liabilities. Which in the case of SUNW is only $18M, mostly short term operational debt. Their long term liability is only a few million.  

The -$88m is their total accumulated equity deficit since inception. Not money they owe.  

> SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020. 

This appears to be because they generate most of their revenue from commercial solar projects, not residential installs.  Smaller number of large scale project, which is how they generate almost $40M in revenue from 500 installs.

In general, with a focus on commercial I’m not surprised they took a revenue hit. But they ended 2020 with $39M in the bank. Added another $49M through a stock issue. They don’t have a cash problem.  

And last year they lost $15M, $4 of which was Goodwill and $3M in one time legal fees and bad debt. Nothing unusual here.

It is still over valued IMO but there is nothing wrong with their balance sheet and they have plenty of working capital. They have a lot of cash and they appear to be using it to acquire smaller solar companies.",['MMM']

I have been seeing, for the past few months, a lot of news regarding the Turkish lira and how it lost so much value and how Turkey's economy is in shambles, etc. Not only that but Erdogan doesn't make things easier and might very well take the country to total economic collapse.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision? As far as I see it, because the lira devalued so much, it would be much cheaper for someone holding other currencies.

mh6l6f,,investing,post,1617198775,"Goldman Sachs is close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clientsGoldman Sachs is close to offering its first investment vehicles for bitcoin and other digital assets to clients of its private wealth management group, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

Horizon 10-15 years

20K to begin with, topping at least 1K per month.
 
I read a couple of books on investing over the weekend and came to the conclusion that with my (lack of) knowledge of the markets my best bet is to go for maximally diversified portfolio,  and put it all into shares for now, to (hopefully!) gain some momentum to begin with. I’d be also inclined to tilt it a little towards growth and tech for the coming year.
 
So I’m thinking:
 
75%  Vanguard FTSE All-world (VWRP =  VT in the US) TER 0.25%

15%  Nasdaq 100 (=QQQ) TER 0.30%

10%  S&P SmallCap 600 TER 0.375%
 
I’m not sure what to think of the overlap between Nasdaq and All-World. It adds exposure to that sector of course, but it tech has done so well over the past 5 years…
 
One alternative would be to keep it super simple and just go for All-World. There’s also a cheaper All-World option on my platform, although it hasn’t done as well as the Vanguard one.

mhr8j1,gt11ba2,investing,comment,1617283478,"I just began investing again in January, and I've been buying fractional shares of certain stocks like Amazon and Tesla. Just looking for general feedback on my portfolio.

I have AAPL (7 shares), AMZN (.13 shares), TSLA (.6 shares), DIS (2 shares), CCIV (31 shares), CMG (.13 shares), COST (.64 shares), VYNE (12 shares), RWT (20 shares), VHT (.5 shares), VNQ (5 shares), VOO (.2 shares)., ARKK (1.4 shares), THNQ (2.15 shares), BOTZ (.6 shares), ARKQ (.29 shares) and ARKX (2 shares).

My goal was to continue buying fractional shares each pay check in Amazon, Tesla, Costco and Chipotle so I can slowly accumulate more equity over time, but I'm beginning to wonder if it makes more sense to just sell my fractional shares and re-allocate those investments into VOO and ARKK. I do like holding single stocks of Apple and Disney and since they aren't quite as high in cost I've been able to buy whole shares which is nice. I guess I'm not sure if trying to obtain a single share of Amazon over time is even worth it, or if I'd see a greater return putting $3k into VOO. I do plan to eventually get rid of VYNE, I bought that on a whim and am in the red but I've been waiting for it to bounce up.

So I guess I'm just looking for general feedback on whether it would make sense to continue beefing up my standings in some of these stocks over time or if I'd be better suited to just put those dollars into indexes and ETFs for the most part?","['DIS', 'ARKK', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'CMG']"

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

mhaez0,gsxqvf2,investing,comment,1617212160,"This may sound hand-wavey, and I suppose it is, but something doesn't smell good to me. The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up. Like I said, I don't know if this is true, and I didn't see an answer in my 5 second Google search. Having tried literally all options myself (/s), it's now up to you.",['GOOGL']
mhaez0,gsxplgr,investing,comment,1617211588,"Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

Imo analyzing a company is a bit like war gaming.

mh4gbw,,investing,post,1617191640,"My take on Gold's longterm outlookFrom a technical perspective, gold is in a 10 year long c[up and handle](https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1617190625002.png) pattern, and it could go sideways for many more years until a breakout target of about 2900 is met. The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",

mh1zc3,gswgjxp,investing,comment,1617186949,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['SPGI', 'NDAQ', 'DOW', 'ADP']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

The etf is up 20% for now. 
That's higher than the usual return you get on such an etf.

What's best practice in such a case? 

1.) Realize the gains and reinvest 

2.) Realize the whole fund and wait for the (inevitable?!) correction to re-invest at a lower point

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

I know that time in the market beats timing the market, but can't imagine that one should let such an opportunity slip (especially as it is a very young investment).

mgwrdt,,investing,post,1617159948,"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market. It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys. Stuff like WDI Corp, which runs restaurant chains:  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3068:JP

Edit 2: The model has settled down- now 2000-2500 a day in late April. That's still state of emergency level, but regular state of emergency level, such as closing restaurants early. Maybe better to just wait this out and buy the dip.",['GOOGL']

Let me know when you place the trade. As someone living in Tokyo, I'll happily take the other side of your trade. 

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

Do we feel bad for Hwang? I certainly don't. His stocks ran up hundreds of percent in the last 6 months and instead of easing up it looks like he doubled down and paid the price for it. 


I know even the investment sub reddits have gone full late stage capitalism, eat the rich, ban hedge funds etc. But really, this is what makes a market. It has to be legal to lose money or else everyone in WSB would be rounded up and thrown in jail.",

mgwwiy,gt1x9mo,investing,comment,1617298410,"Buffet has shown himself to be a fossil fuel addict. Very much not a fan of this side of him. This proposal for 10 new gas plants is a disappointment. It is not the least cost solution, nor is it good for air quality or climate change. Not to mention that this proposed solution is to add more gas plants to solve the problem of gas plants shutting down due to cold weather and making the largest contribution to the dropoff in electricity production. This proposal would end up being an expensive, underutilized boondoggle for Texans. The solution in Texas is winterization of their electricity supply chain and more solar paired with batteries and other energy storage, NOT polluting and expensive new gas peakers. There is a reason that new natural gas plants are only expected to be 16% of new electricity capacity in 2021.",

mfs7vk,,investing,post,1617032204,"Stock Scraper Trending Data as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

Now after you do a few other steps you're left with 10-15 tickers. My question is how do you manage to go from 450 tickers down to 10-15. This would be a week-long project for myself.

Management review:

* Compensation
There is a significant bonus for the Board of Director as stated in its annual report 2018:
**""The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs (including stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity""**

In the same period (CMIIW), the company fire 800 employee.

you can check the detail here:
https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions
but I quote here
**The disparity between bottom-line executive compensation and what the 800 people laid off were making is staggering. Bobby Kotick has become the villain in this story. Kotick drew a $1.75 million salary plus another $26 million or so in stock and other equity awards in 2017. Dennis Durkin, who recently returned to the CFO role and was also put in charge of “emerging business” (figuring out where the company will make its money in the coming years), was given a $3.75 million cash bonus and another $11.3 million in as-yet unearned, performance-based equity**

Maybe this policy makes people judge The CEO, Bobby Kotick is a profit-oriented person - but honestly, which CEO doesn't?

* Destiny exclusivity for Playstation: Wrong strategy? But Bungie Games has divorced with Activision.
* Forcing microtransactions: Do it really bad? Even when the gamer doesn't like it, they keep playing the franchise.

Note:
I'm not a gamer, I play Deck Heroes, Mythgard, other TCG or CCG (unfortunately I don't play Hearthstone), FIFA (a long time ago). Thus I don't have expertise in the genre that Activision published.

Any comment would be very appreciated.

_______________________
Revision I

I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...
_______________________
Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

You present several statements that raise certain questions.  For example:

1.	""Its PE ratio is similar to EA.""  It's trading at 15x book value... Why should I invest in EA or Activision if I can find a dozen or so companies that are trading at a significant discount?  You invoke the Graham/Buffett concept ""margin of safety"" but DCF analysis puts  its fair value between $71 and $78 per share.  That's the opposite of margin of safety.
2.	""has no intangible assets"" ... No? What's the $1.8 billion in accumulated intangible amortization?  You can't amortize assets you don't have.
3.	""Strong balance sheet""... what was the $18 million unrealized loss in Q3 of 2020 due to?
4.	How about the $6.8 billion in Goodwill?  That's an intangible asset.  What acquisitions are related to this and if they're still carrying this value, why would it be better for them to spend the $8 billion on more acquisitions than stock repurchases given that:
5.	"" but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance.""  Is it?  I see $11 billion in APIC.  Again: In these economically uncertain times, why would more acquisitions be better than share repurchases?
6.	""Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.""  What's the $194 million write down of AR in Q4 2020?  There's a quarterly carrying value around $83 million as a provision for doubtful accounts.  What's the connection between these two items and why could its resurgence to 2017 levels present a material impairment to their business, particularly under current economic conditions?

What concerns me is that you approach the analysis from the Graham angle of value and margin of safety, yet present no discussion of the indicators of the same.  The underpinnings of due diligence are in the data, which aren't presented or discussed in your analysis.  It's not that the above questions all have displeasing answers, but rather that these are the kind of questions you should be anticipating and addressing in your due diligence.

Due diligence is not an attempt to pitch me the prettiest profile of the company.   It's got to be a kicking of the tires, asking the tough questions, and seeing whether your hypothesis holds up to serious scrutiny.... and these are just questions I, as a relatively average FP&A guy, came up with glancing at the financials for five minutes, and it's not because I have a particular view of the company, but that is precisely the point.  Your analysis needs to be thorough and objective.",['EA']

mfkoyj,,investing,post,1617005626,"BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial ResultsUp until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

mfbyli,,investing,post,1616971610,"Investing in Helium - DMEHF DD **Investing in Desert Mountain Energy (DME.V, DMEHF)**

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

"" Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon "" Helium demand did not exceed supply last year, largely due to decreased use during the pandemic. 

"" Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining. "" Terming this companies financials as ""good"" is uh... a stretch. They raised some money (not enough to execute their plan) and they don't spend much because they aren't doing much.

"" Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day."" Test well (singular) has shown this. As mentioned previously the second well is much much worse, mostly in terms of flow rate, but the helium percentage is a bit over half as much as well.

"" Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less. ""  This seems to assume all wells are as good as the first and not as bad as the second. 

Finally, you use analysis from the cormark report here: [https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom\_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom](https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom)"" but gave a $20+ price target while ignoring their $4.25 price target.  If you're going to use their info you should probably also at least mention their price target.

I am by no means trying to convince people to stay away from this one. I just am presenting the other side for you.  You should be aware you're paying 128 million for 13 million, a plan, some leases and a few holes in the ground at least one of which seems to produce a significant amount of helium. That's pretty much how most companies start, but people should be aware this is still really early stages and a lot could still go wrong.",

Stocks traded roughly flat Tuesday, putting a pause on the recent record-breaking rally. Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies' first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that's actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that's taking the market higher. And I don't think we're done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you're going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.""

The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon.

**Highlights**

* US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged the adoption of a minimum global corporate tax rate during virtual meetings with the World Bank and IMF.

Topps is best known for its sports trading cards, specializing in baseball cards for over 75 years. The company recently entered the non-fungible token space. Michael Eisner, former Disney CEO, is the chairman of the company.
* A U.S. auto industry group on Monday urged the government to help as it warned the global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
* The International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for global growth this year amid a better-than-expected outlook for the U.S. and other major economies. The institution now sees worldwide growth increasing 6% this year, up from the 5.5% rise seen previously. This follows a historic contraction of 3.3% in 2020.

NOK appears to be taking major market share from Huawei and has projects on tap with the US DOD etc... Just seams like momentum should be shifting. What in the world am I missing on this one?


Nokia (NOK) is a stock many investors are watching right now. NOK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.26. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.41. Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.35, with a median of 15.63.

Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 0.9. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.67.

These are just a handful of the figures considered in Nokia's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that NOK is an impressive value stock right now.","['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'VZ']"

mlvjec,,StockMarket,post,1617775096,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIOHey again everyone,

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)","['TWTR', 'IR', 'TSLA']"

Also in this current market many people have lost trust is EV. The year of the EV/ clean energy was 2020 in my opinion. I mean a lot of these plays are still down insane amounts compared to the rest of the market. 

Nio and GME arent the same and didnt go up/ down for the same reason so its a little interesting you think they are trying to do the same thing... not everything is a conspiracy theory. In a year i think NIO will definitely be back up to its former glory/ price especially after some good earning reports (especially after the issues last time...) but Cramer saying its going to fall back down isnt really surprising in my opinion... Stocks to up and stocks go down...

Plus as another redditor explained the other day CNBC/ Cramer talk about stocks short term, mid term and long term... so that all has to be considered.

We noticed that many folks out there still underestimate the 'power' of alternative data, despite recent price surges in several meme stocks, which could have easily been spotted ahead of time if one would monitor metrics like attention and sentiment on a daily basis. Therefore we want to give a brief summary on academic findings regarding the predictive abilities of those metrics and show how to leverage alternative data as the individual investor can hardly rely on a dedicated team which analyzes alternative data on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

**Research Findings**

There are several academic papers exploring the advantages of alternative data. Most studies we've read, found that the data can be used to forecast at least one metric with regard to financial time series. The different findings are likely due to their differences in sourced data as they all analyze sentiment and/or attention but from different sources.

**Alternative Data And Trading**

Most of the time academic findings are quite nice, but for several reasons it is pretty damn hard to just trade what they found as there is a huge gap between their mathematics and real-life financial markets and let's not forget that each paper sourced data differently which makes things way more complicated.

But after getting all this data (like in 'a real-time stream of never-ending data') and processing it (again in real-time, like in 24/7) we were able to monitor the S&P 500 constituents with regard to investors sentiment and overall attention (obviously we monitor other metrics as well but for the sake of this post we skip that part).

At the end of each week we check the prior week's top attention and sentiment stocks and buy them for the upcoming week. If we would've traded those picks, we would have made about **16%** since 04.01.2021 to 29.03.2021 which is about twice the SPY's return in the same period.

&#x200B;

Obviously it is pretty easy to just say this without some evidence that we knew the corresponding stocks ahead of time. The good news is: we posted those trading ideas each monday ahead of the opening bell on [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/u/thebAIte/), on [stocktwits.com](https://stocktwits.com/thebAIte) and send it to all those who subscribed to our weekly f\[AI\]nance reports. If one would have followed us all along, he/she/it could have easily made those gains. The bad news is: we do not provide those ideas for free anymore.

&#x200B;

**Leverage Alternative Data**

In order to incorporate alternative data into your trading, you would have to either pay huge amounts to get a reliable API connections and a powerful processing unit (with appropriate systems to extract and evaluate alternative metrics) or you would have to find a legit alternative data provider, which sell their data, in general, for a rather high price.

Actually there is a huge lack of alternative data vendors for retail traders, but the next good news is: the b\[AI\]te (we) offers a free version of their [alternative data platform f\[AI\]nance](https://thebaite.com/products). If you want to tap into alternative data you might [register](https://thebaite.com/register) for the free version and get a feeling for what it is like to utilize alternative data the right way.

Nevertheless, after getting access to alternative data (which is the trickiest part) and processing it (which is not less tricky) it can support your decision-making process in several different ways as mentioned in the academic papers' findings. You could just trade outliers in your data (like we did above) or go as far as predicting fund in- and outflows for further portfolio allocation in order to reduce your beta or further boost your alpha.

mm2pmn,,StockMarket,post,1617803993,"Your opinion on dating appsSo recently Bumble had an IPO (February) and I've been watching Match group's (owner of tinder) growth and recent 10% fall. 

I've been reading about the possible future outcome of both companies and My prediction is the following:

After global pandemic and with millenials and generationz's inability to socialize both companies will skyrocket in the upcoming years :)

If we however analyse the numbers on detail:

, Match group has a market cap of 37.71 B USD, with a year range of 87.56-174.68 a volume of 2.40 M, and a 18.58% revenue increase with 11.88 income increase, and a P/E ratio of 69.5 which could mean either that is an expensive buy now or that the company is growing. 

However on bumble we have 7.22 B USD market cap, 2.43 volume and a range of 57.40-84.80 $ since February  with no data yet on p/e ratio and an increase of 31.12 % on the revenue and -322. 91% on net income. 

Would you rather go for a more secure option and buy MATCH GROUP or rather speculate on a growing company with higher possible earnings and buy BUMBLE??",

I'm trying to work something out in my head. Some people were saying Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and my argument was that no, it behaves like any other stock, options, futures, etc...

But that got me to thinking.

With a dividend-paying stock, you get value just from owning the stock. A payment for the amount of stock that you own, plus capital gains if people also want that sweet dividend and buy it up and increase the stock's price.

Is non-dividend stock completely based on capital gains (ponzi-esque) investing? Say you own 1000 shares of GME - the only value is based off what people were willing to pay for that, and you hope more people want it to drive the price up so you can sell, right?

I've read the argument that non-dividend paying companies use the capital that could be dividend payments to instead expand the company, therefore creating more value (which sounds like bullshit to me)... cause even if the company is more valuable, you still get nothing from owning the stock except the hope that more people buy the stock and drive the price up.

Am I missing something here?",

This trading week interim Phase 3 II data will potentially be released for Covaxin and an EUA (Emergency Use  Authorization) application will shortly follow for the USA from OCGN. (**Major Catalyst**)

**OCGN -** Will  receive royalties for the vaccine, COVAXIN, at a 45% rate from all  sales in the USA, from a partnership with a well know vaccine maker Bharat Biotech. **USA EUA Submission timeline is April, as stated by the company**.

**Covaxin**  plays an important role because it is one of the only vaccines that has been shown to have a high defense to current and potentially future mutations of the virus.

**Covid Mutations already:** [LINK](https://srhd.org/news/2021/coronavirus-mutations-and-variants-what-does-it-mean)   |    **Covaxin is different:** [LINK](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/bharat-biotech-covid-19-vaccine.html)

&#x200B;

With the major catalyst from above in mind, if you take a look at when Phase 3 Interim II results came out for Pfizer's vaccine, they were only **about a month apart**.

They’ve also partnered up with NFI Group a global bus company.

-this gives me 4 estimates to work from and most solid companies will be pretty consistent across all 4. 

-then I play out different scenarios like bring the valuation way down, where do we get to? Try and factor in future growth that is known (like say a company has secured a new contract and we know its value) and see how it affects the outlook.

If a dividend is also included that’s great. If anyone has funds they’ve researched or invest in themselves I’m all ears.

mlabf0,,StockMarket,post,1617711502,"I built a platform to share and track investment ideasTLDR:

We built platform that allows you to share/discuss investment ideas and see the associated financial information (real-time prices, ratios, price charts, etc.) all in one place. We don’t have finance backgrounds, so we wanted a place where we could have decent due diligence with transparency. When you share an idea it captures your entry price and it is added to your portfolio people can see your DD

I figured people might find it interesting (you might or might not) but thought it was worth sharing

[You can check it out here, would love to know if it’s useful](https://info.utradea.com/)

A bit more detail

About a year ago my friend and I started getting into investing and we were tired of searching the internet for due diligence and finance data. We thought wouldn’t it be great if we could share and discuss quality investment ideas and have the supporting financial data all in one place. We wanted to make investing easier - without the BS and pumping.

Some cool features

* A dedicated DD upload process that helps structure investment ideas
* Portfolio and watchlist to track ideas that you have shared and see entry and exit prices
* Reddit Sentiment Analysis that currently tracks trending stocks on WSB
* An SEC Filing feed that identifies relevant filings and highlights the potential impact on the price
* SPAC Data to keep track of recent mergers, acquisitions and all things SPAC related

We have been mostly sharing this with our friends and they really enjoy using the platform, so we figured we would start to share it with others. We see this as being a social platform for the regular / retail investor to learn about investing, discussing ideas with the community, and having the tools and information needed to become a better investor.

We are adding more features and enjoying the process of building a cool platform that we love to use",

I recently decided to participate in the stock market after seeing some co-workers using it but I am not sure how to get around to it. I opened a fidelity brokerage account but I am not sure if thats the right thing to do. What I basically wanted to do was maybe get $20 and divide it into different stocks to see how it works and give myself a chance to understand it before putting more money. Is the fidelity brokerage account good for this or should I look into another platform. If you recommend a different platform, which one should that be? I mostly want to do it for fun and see what happens and hopefully maybe get a few bucks out of it. Thanks for all the advice, I am new to this and don't yet completely understand how it all works.",

Fidelity is great, you'll get the best prices because they're big and they don't sell order flow, they do their own market-making in-house.

But if you're really honestly just wanting to do it for fun, then yeah, just some in and play around and see what happens. But generally, $20 isn't enough, because individual shares of quality stocks are usually between $10 and $100. A few are higher. Anything under $5 is considered a ""penny stock,"" and those are mostly low quality companies.

Now, if you're using the Fidelity app, instead of the website, you can buy fractional shares, where you put in a dollar amount, so then $20 would work fine. But you can only buy high quality stocks that way, that are chosen to be in that system. And you can't really move them, because a third party is providing the service of buying the real shares, and then selling you fractions of them. So when you decide to get serious, you're better off buying real shares instead.👼",['SPGI']

Random Word Generator


Welcome to the website. If you're here, you're likely looking to find random words. Random Word Generator is the perfect tool to help you do this. While this tool isn't a word creator, it is a word generator that will generate random words for a variety of activities or uses. Even better, it allows you to adjust the parameters of the random words to best fit your needs.
The first option the tool allows you to adjust is the number of random words to be generated. You can choose as many or as few as you'd like. You also have the option of choosing words that only begin with a certain letter, only end with a certain letter or only begin and end with certain letters. If you leave these blank, the randomize words that appear will be from the complete list.
You also have the option of choosing the number of syllables of the words or the word length of the randomized words. There are also options to further refine by choosing ""less than"" or ""greater than"" options for both syllables and word length. Again, if you leave the space blank, the complete list of randomized words will be used. Finally, you can choose between standard text or cursive words. The cursive words will all be in cursive using cursive letters.
Once you have input all of your specifications, all you have to do is to press the Generate Random Words button, and a list of random words will appear. Below are some of the common ways people use this tool.

Games

This tool can be useful for games like Pictionary or MadLibs. Since the words are random, this helps to keep a game like Pictionary fair for all those playing. For a game like MadLibs, it can help kids improve their vocabulary by generating words they may not have ever considered to fill in the blank spaces. The tool has the potential to help with any word game that doesn't require a specific word.

Creative Writing

For those who write, this tool can be an excellent device to aid in the creative writing process. By using the tool to create 5 random words, a writer could then attempt to use all of them in a single paragraph. Longer random word lists could be incorporated into a short story. Since the writer doesn't know which words will appear, creativity must be used to successfully incorporate all the words. To make the challenge even more difficult, the writer could try to use the words in the exact order they were generated. In this way, writers can challenge their creativity to push their writing skills.

Spelling and Vocabulary

This tool can be an excellent way to improve vocabulary or practice for spelling bees. If an unfamiliar word appears, looking up the meaning will help students increase the number of words they know. Working with a partner, students can test each other on the spelling for the randomized words generated.

Name Inspiration

If you need to create a name for a product, an event, a band or for anything else, this tool can be quite helpful. As you consider names, generate a number of random words and see how they impact what you have already come up with. Inputting unique words you may not have considered can spark additional creativity to eventually help you produce the perfect name for your project. If you're looking for good character names or baby names, you might be interested in our random name generator.
The above list is not comprehensive. There are literally hundreds of ways the Random Word Generator can be used. Please feel free to share the way you use this tool, and we always welcome suggestions on how we can improve it to serve you better. We are also interested in new word generators you'd be interested in us creating. Many of the tools on this website came from ideas from people like you who contacted us. Please take the time to explore the other random generators we have available which can be found in the right sidebar of the page.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is the most common word?

The most common word in English is the word ""the"" while the most common spoken word is ""be"" including its other forms (is, are, am).

What is a random word?

In the case of our random word generator, a random word is a word that is randomly chosen from the database of words we have in our generator. It's a word that you have no idea or control over appearing, so you aren't able to influence the resulting word in any way.

What is the most random word?

The most random word in English is aardvark. Of course, there's really no way to answer this question because its entirely based on opinion. That being said, feel free to contact us if you think you know a more random word than aardvark.

Is every word in English in your random word generator?

No. It doesn't makes sense to include every word since many words aren't often used these days and many words the average person doesn't necessarily know the meaning. We have a curated list of words that aren't too common or too difficult that the vast majority of people using this generator will know and understand.

And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity. 

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention. 

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term. 

**Marketing/Branding** 

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/48i52tsrwhr61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e50e26426b6a45e60340ef22178512cf230fba4

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)** 

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/f89e77xhxhr61.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=b647432fd882f8041c1e343e97b3d50ff59ec475

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website. 

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo. 

&#x200B;

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.  

 

https://preview.redd.it/dl5x59njxhr61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=c02bb215962442940f90d50f38d4d16cb947c1a5

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination. 

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials** 

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly. This was pulled from their SEC filling. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9tubwslxhr61.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef44bdb33107f5d22280da651b37037c14ca396

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz) 

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.** 

&#x200B;

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing. 

**Other Analyst and Stock Price** 

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

**Downsides for the company** 

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion. 

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand. 

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy.  In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR** 

Pros 

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue 

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics) 

\- Companies has royalties they can collect 

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them. 

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons 

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business 

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['CHD', 'GPS', 'NKE']"

Is there a real reason that so many younger people with this huge purchase looming are investing/risking so much? 

I found myself coming to the realization during this downturn that it is quite important for those of us that are younger or in a house buying situation to only invest a smaller amount that wouldn't be devastating to lose, so I ended up trimming down a large percentage of my portfolio to sit on the sidelines.

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.""We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) can be an income machine for stimulus check recipients.

For example, the rollout of 5G networks should be a significant positive for AT&T. It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.


AT&T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months. This may have to do with subsidiary WarnerMedia releasing all of its movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they'll hit theaters.","['CMCSA', 'AMP']"
mkqfqa,,StockMarket,post,1617644826,"Meaning of ""38 - Redemption, retraction, cancellation, repurchase""?Hi,

I am researching the recent insiders' trading of a Canadian company listed on TSX using the Canadian Insider website. Not being a finance/accounting person, I do not understand some of the terminology used and how to interpret some of the figures presented.

So for the stock I am looking at, there are the following entries for the director of the company recently:

So has the director of the company recently bought 15792 shares and sold 38703 and 121334 shares (which seems to be a negative sign for the stock)?

Could anyone explain to me the meaning of ""Exercise of third party derivative"" and ""Redemption, retraction, cancellation, repurchase"" in this context?

Is there an underlying they buy and sell? I’m confused because I know you can’t buy shares in the VIX, it’s an options only thing. What do you get delivered to you if you exercise your contract?

If the VIX rockets up and a whole bunch of call options suddenly go in the money, what would a market maker do to hedge in that instance?

Bonus question: is it possible to gamma squeeze the VIX if the call contracts are set up in a “ramp” and the price goes up high enough?

I’m still noticing some interesting call ramps to very high strike prices on the VIX on June 16, so I’m wondering if someone is setting up something so the millions of calls go in the money if the price rockets up that high.",
mkvdud,gti0u47,StockMarket,comment,1617658772,"I've wondered the same thing with VIX and other tickers that have no underlying.  I think what happens is you just get delivered cash, rather than shares.  There's basically no way to sell a covered call, either, so, all calls are naked by default, and exercising them just withdraws the funds from the seller's account (which are presumably held as affected buying power, anyway)

I'm not exactly sure what a MM does to hedge their bets here, but I'm guessing it has to do with spreading out their sales across a long enough period that a single spike isn't going to devastate them.  VIX usually jumps up for very short periods of time.

To answer your bonus question, it is not possible to gamma squeeze VIX, because its underlying price is not tied to anything limited that you can buy.",

In the video, the CEO explained that the merger would be beneficial to Seneca shareholders, who are frustrated with historical stock performance. He went on to explain that through the merger, Seneca shareholders will enjoy ownership in a company with a world-class management team, several valuable ts, and a focus on providing shareholder value. 

Leading BioSciences has a strong pipeline of gastrointestinal drugs and a management team that has a strong history of performance.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

I'm not saying that to be cheeky, I'm saying that because I'm probably wrong about a lot in this post and would appreciate being corrected. *I ain't no goddamn financial advisor. Ain't no goddamn financial advice. I just think the goddamn stock is nice.*

Second of all, I am not trying to predict a date. However, as many other fine simians before me have already elucidated, it's very likely that GME will rise and falls several times leading up to the MOAS like so many ominous rumbling farts preceding an epic shart. Just as it is with a sloppy wet one, there are usually preceding clues that make you mentally take stock of your supply of clean underwear (I don't know why there's already so many shit analogies in this post, I really don't). One of the most commonly used metrics used to predict a bearish or bullish turn is the MACD.

It stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence (there's a tongue twister for ya). The MACD is calculated using the difference between two exponential moving averages of a stock, usually over 26 days and 12 days. The MACD can be be either positive (more bullish) or negative (more bearish) but is most often tracked against the 9 day exponential moving average (EMA9) of the MACD itself in order to predict bullish or bearish sentiment. If it moves above its EMA9, it signals upward momentum and a recent or pending reversal. This is also known as the sought after **golden cross**. Day traders, of which GME has ***none*** \*glares for dramatic effect\*, use the MACD on the 15min, 30min, and 1hr charts to try and predict swings. To better prepare for impending sharp bounces or falls in our favorite stonk, I looked at macro trends in the 4hr and 1 day MACD preceding known squeezes. There are a few trends I've noticed.

* The MACD will often already be above the EMA9 leading up to a bounce. This makes sense because it's measuring growing momentum. However, this isn't always the case.
* The MACD in volatile stocks will often dip below the EMA9 after the stock has already dropped following a bounce.
* The 4hr charts usually show a golden cross before a sudden uptick
* The 1 day chart's golden cross usually lags a little behind but is a better indicator of steady momentum and sentiment vs. volatile swings

Let's take a look at these crosses in action using some established examples. First, we got PLTR. Palantir only recently went public in late 2020 and started out strong. On the 1 day chart, you can see the MACD sliding under the EMA9 for the first time on 12/11/20 followed by an extended period of trading mostly sideways.

[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ty0h2io06rr61.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19eec76613ed72d807e1ddedc49e76327e9fda5)

&#x200B;

Over a month later, it crossed positive again on 01/21/21 just as the gamma squeeze started. However, you can see the trend lines slowly coalescing just before that point, hinting at an impending upswing in momentum.

[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/hq2uird36rr61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=153aee863e91337687c85ff7038b04c106ecf6fd)

&#x200B;

The golden cross appears **much earlier** on the 4hr chart.

[PLTR 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/z4dy29556rr61.png?width=1629&format=png&auto=webp&s=a877f289bab3f432e1a972cfbe8cdcb8965065f2)

&#x200B;

The negative MACD crossing during its double peak only happened **after** it fell on **both** drops.

&#x200B;

[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wmgjhk576rr61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=75514080b49d216d5594e8b6155b22794077882e)

&#x200B;

Another well known recent event is SNDL's squeeze. On the 1 day chart, you can see the golden cross occur just as the stock starts its meteoric climb. Unfortunately, its crash came abruptly and the negative crossing only happened after its descent. The gap between the MACD and EMA9 oscillated prior to the spike. Most important is to note is how narrow their gap was in the days preceding the upswing. And again, the golden cross comes about a day earlier on the 4hr chart compared to the 1 day and the negative crossing occurs **after** the drop.

&#x200B;

[SNDL 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/r89d6yga6rr61.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=fda5f96e4e513c86ce322de2655f9c30df01bcdd)

&#x200B;

Finally, let's look at the golden boy himself, TSLA. This is a great one to use because the squeeze lasted for so long and consisted of several mini squeezes leading up to its eventual peak. The MACD and EMA9 oscillated back and forth very tightly up until 12/13/19 when it crossed over days before a massive upswing. The cross appeared earlier on the 4hr chart on 12/09/19. The stock then crashed but interestingly not before the negative cross reared its head to signal downward momentum.

[TSLA 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nuimd6bd6rr61.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1aa318ba8b04b880978d289092cd0274d870f54)

&#x200B;

You can see this pattern repeat again and again

https://preview.redd.it/9bdc6kzg6rr61.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3d6ea82c0306ff61d80b6d7685efb848239e8f

&#x200B;

The 4HR chart caught the next upswing in August earlier by 2 days. The most recent spike with a golden cross was caught at the start on both 1 day and 4hr charts on 11/17/20

https://preview.redd.it/0wt6nvmi6rr61.png?width=2836&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b26d4e15073ff96d2eab1574d944626751c929

So...wtf does this have to GME? Well rev up dem tits, boys, we're goin tendie huntin!

The squeeze that could have been had its golden cross MUCH sooner than the peak but did happen to occur on the 1 day chart right in the middle of a bump on 01/13/21. The crossover occurred a day earlier on the 4hr chart.

[GME 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/di6fftuj6rr61.png?width=1907&format=png&auto=webp&s=4852d32f9c07d9437be87102c15905a136d50d31)

&#x200B;

The Second Coming coincided with another cross but well after it began on the 1 day chart on 02/25/21. What about the 4hr? It shows up **four trading days earlier** on 02/19/21

[GME 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/s1707wen6rr61.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=073b05a050cd764d5c6e45d071db01c3b6f7185b)

&#x200B;

And that brings us to today. On the 1 day chart, the MACD is still underwater with a spread of -5.09. You can see the channel narrowing. For comparison, the spread on the 1 day chart was -3.58 on 02/24/19 the day before it crossed.

[GME 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/2quuzm7q6rr61.png?width=1907&format=png&auto=webp&s=55407e6c7db10a6d8e9acc065c3f5a66c71ba4a9)

&#x200B;

What about the 4hr chart, you ask? We already crossed over. **FIVE TRADING DAYS AGO**

[GME 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/z73b17ur6rr61.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0b93dcc1e81049c78b9c112201645fdeeb0d07)

&#x200B;

The MACD and EMA9 are currently oscillating. We slipped back under the EMA9 on the 4hr chart yesterday but only just barely. The spread is -0.09 so it may as well be zero. Look at the narrowing of the two trend lines. See how they come together and have been twisting back and forth since 03/30? That's a fuse being spun together. Are you ass cheeks clenched yet? Well clench harder. Let's look at MACD and EMA9 spread for the 1 day chart starting from 01/13/21.

https://preview.redd.it/baarfwat6rr61.png?width=154&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f97c7c603005bf79c3191a66a4b18e850564f9

&#x200B;

As you can see, the spread has remained negative for 11 days in a row. The previous spread remained negative for 13 days in a row before the stock jumped from $44 to close at $91 the following day. The stock had also just hit a 28 day low volume of 7.57 million the day before it jumped. The previous low occurred on 01/12 with a volume of 7.06 million **the day before the MACD-EMA9 spread turned positive** **on the day chart**. Yesterday's volume was **6.08 million,** ***a 29 day low.***

TL;DR

Fuse lit. Wait for boom boom. Buy. Hodl. Clench dem cheeks. 🚀 🚀 🚀

mm38u7,,wallstreetbets,post,1617805482,"Gamma Squeeze on VIAC because of HF failure.Ok so I have been in VIAC for a while before this whole crap show of a dip. Never played it for squeezing. When the dip came I went to work and charted the crap out of it and forecasted a bottom at $40 (we hit $39.81 before moving positive). Check. Start recovey. Price target $60 and $75 YE.

Now while talking with my fellow apes about price predictions this week and future forecasts I decided to take a look at the options chain and noticed something pretty great.

RSI is oversold territory right now with the price increasing on the daily candle. Stoch RSI poised for uptrend and MACD momentum shifting. We are entering an uptrend. Again supporting that $40 bottom and new (technically 2020) trend channel.

VIAC closes above $45 by WE easily and apx 61k calls are ITM, apx $270.1M. We are already there.

VIAC can close a very doable price of just above $49 Friday now 150.1k calls are ITM or $676.26m.

This quite literally puts all the calls ITM and all the puts OOTM Friday.

This pattern of calls continues until June 18th. With most calls in the same window. With VIAC holding $50 before weeks end we may be looking at a Gamma Squeeze coupled with fomo rocketing it back up to it's former price point, then repeating all month. There is also some borrowed shorts in there that would get screwed as a nice icing on the cake.

***EDIT*** wish I could post the picture maybe I'll have to photo bucket it. BUT

Right now VIAC is trading in the same channel it entered in May 2020 before the run up this year. It's a more stable  trendline than the path it was on before the dip. It's been in this channel 84% of the time in the last 14 months. It's at a more stable price than it's been at Feb.

I’ll keep it short and sweet. Paysafe just went public through a reverse merger SPAC, and has been trading on the NYSE for less than a week. This is like getting in bed with Square at $15/share.

Here are 8 reasons to believe🙌:

1. Bill Foley is behind the merger. The man is a legend in Financial Services and has a strong history of value creation, having led five separate multibillion-dollar public market platforms that completed over 100 acquisitions. Think Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity Information Services, Black Knight Financial, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ceridian. You know, small companies. 🤪📈💰

2. Founded in 1996, Paysafe is a leading global payments provider focused on digital commerce and iGaming transactions. The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027. 📈

3. Paysafe holds the No. 2 market share position in the global digital wallet market. The company’s digital wallet is in over 120 markets and has customers like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and William Hill. The company has 3.8 million active users for its digital wallet segment.

4. Paysafe is No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment. Customers for this segment include Fortnite, Twitch and Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT).

5. The company estimates that its 2021 payment volume will hit $103 billion. 💰💰💰Billion with a B! Revenue of $1.5 billion is estimated for fiscal 2021. Paysafe said revenue will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% from 2020 to 2023.

6. The digital wallet segment is expected to have $441 million in revenue for 2021 with a 1.9% take on transactions. This represents 29% of the company’s 2021 revenue.

7. The eCash segment has 12 million active users and $5 billion in payment volume. This segment has a take of 6.8% and is expected to have 2021 revenue of $318 million.

8. The integrated processing segment has over $75 billion in payment volume and a 1% take. This segment is expected to have revenue of $764 million in fiscal 2021, representing 50% of the company’s total.

Mind you THIS IS NOT A STARTUP! It’s a profitable company with a proven track record, robust sales and a lucrative Total Addressable Market within reach. It’s a long term hold for sure, but with the core drivers outlined above I’m confident we’ll see this as a 10x bagger in less than 5 years. 💎🚀💰🙌📈

mliwqp,,wallstreetbets,post,1617735365,"BlackBerry: How the Patent Sale could transform BBOn March 30, BlackBerry has reported Q4 and FY21 results/call AH. At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.

This is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)

**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**

Quick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.

The points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?

***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that ""big number"" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).

Assuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.

With a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).

***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*

The main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.

***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). 

Speculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.

That said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.

***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.

**The Transformation**

By now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).

If and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.

In terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*

He later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*

***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.

*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*

The goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

Similarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).

One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

**The Bear Case**

If the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*

**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up.","['GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB', 'AAPL']"

A while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I’ll copy that below:

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.","['NVDA', 'SPGI', 'GE', 'TSLA', 'MU', 'AMD']"

mlviks,,wallstreetbets,post,1617774995,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIOHey again everyone, 

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

mlrweo,,wallstreetbets,post,1617761647,"Improving as a traderSo what do you guys do to improve your trading game?  I've been using a notebook and keeping track of my trades and writing down what worked and what didn't, as well as coming up with rules to follow to stop myself from repeating mistakes I see more than once.

For example, I've discovered that my biggest weakness is that my prime animal isn't a bear or a bull, it's a pig.  I've missed the direction of a trade exactly three times in the last year, but I've lost money on dozens of trades that I went from green to red on because I refused to accept that the top was in.  This had led to realized losses of over $7k - small potatoes to some of  you, big potatoes to others.  And remember, at one point, I was up on basically every single one of those trades, so the losses counting unrealized and never taken gains are much, much worse.

 I've realized the reason for this is that while the trade is still open, I feel like I'm proving to myself and the world that I'm smart enough to figure out something, and closing the trade by taking profit means I've given up on my idea or admitted it's wrong - nonsensical, I know, but you've got to figure out why you're doing foolish behaviors if you want to stop them.

Since then I've started to set stop sales and it's really helped me to take profits and improve my skills (and portfolio), because once I'm no longer emotionally invested in being ""right"" as I've already taken profit I can much more easily analyze how the equity or trend is doing going forwards, and whether or not it's something I'm happy staying out of or if I want to get back into it at the current price.

My next step is figuring out when to abandon losing positions instead of riding them to zero and starting to make successful hedges on my positions.

How about you?  What are your biggest weaknesses and how are you working to address them and improve?  Share and help the class, we're all trying to make money here, and we're all admitted idiots using fake names, plus it's unlikely your fuckups will be worse than the embarrassing shit I've already posted.",

For example, I ended up holding NOK with a 25% loss. I could've waited a year or two to recover, but I sold it at a loss and bought PLTR and RKT and recovered in a matter of days because I caught their recent spikes.  

I happen to believe that PLTR will hover over the current price for a long time. I might be wrong, but I chose to invest my gains somewhere else.

Regarding your calls, that's tough. They are losing value for the same reason that the stock is not expected to run higher. You could be lucky, but if you wait for luck, you could end up seeing your investment evaporate. You need to decide how much the remainder market value is worth to you. 

That's what I would consider. Not investment advise.",

mli30m,,wallstreetbets,post,1617733136,"A Bet on Canadian Cannabis: The Final BetTLDR: APHA 4/16 $21C

After blessing you all with the Trilogy ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hvfhwg/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j5aqp4/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis_part_2/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kltsat/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis_part_3/)), it is unfortunately time for our last earnings bet on Aphria. Before jumping down to the comment section to give me your smooth brain opinion on cannabis stocks, please take a second to go fuck yourself. 

Those of you who like to make money take a few minutes to read this DD, as it really doesn’t get easier than this. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlcyb6/13k_earnings_yolo_on_apha/) is my position. 

Before I even get into the analysis I wanted to take a second to point out the [article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/aphria-revenue-estimates-lowered-by-stifel-ahead-of-q3-earnings-on-weak-cannabis-consumption-trends-2021-04-06?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo) released today by Stifel. They are lowering earnings expectations due to weak cannabis consumption trends, the share price has dropped 4% today likely because of this article. Stifel expects $163M revenue this Q, and has given us a laughably easy expectation to beat, while also giving us a better entry point. 

**Why Stifel is a Joke, My DD**

Last Q revenues were $160M, they need an additional $3M to beat Stifel expectations

Because I think Stifel has the smoothest brain out of anyone reading this, and I hope they are, I’ll start with Cannabis Revenues.

Last Quarter Highlights:

Canada Rec Sales: Sept: $257M, Oct: $270M, Nov: $261M

Total Canada Sales: $788M

Aphria Net Cannabis Revs were $67M last Q

Now according to Stifel there have been weak cannabis consumptions trends, and I’m not entirely sure where they’re getting this info from. I get mine from the Government of Canada who releases [National Sales](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010000801&pickMembers%5b0%5d=2.30&pickMembers%5b1%5d=3.1) on a monthly basis, so lets take a look. 

[Dec-Feb this Q  ](https://preview.redd.it/32u2iutsflr61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18deaec8e2154510b5f27264467bf3771158e95c)

Canada Rec Sales: Dec: $290M, Jan $282M, Feb N/A

As far as the first 2 months of the quarter go, cannabis consumption has increased 8.5% QoQ, while Stifel is claiming the opposite, in fact December and January are the 2 highest sales months since cannabis was legalized. Aphria has been the #1 LP in Canada for the last 2 quarters and I expect them to continue to hold their current market share as most of the Canadian growth comes from Ontario, where Aphria holds the largest market share. 

Not only are cannabis sales NOT declining in Canada as Stifel suggests, they seemingly forgot that Aphria is adding another existing business to their books this Quarter. Aphria acquired SweetWater Brewing in November, with the deal closing on November 25. We get a glimpse of SweetWater revenues on the last report as it ended Nov 30, recording $881k of revenues in the 6 days the company was on the books. Based on the above we can expect new revenues north of $10M added to the top line from the SweetWater acquisition. That $10M+ in new revenue plus their growing Cannabis Sales should be more than enough to cover Stifel's expectations. 

I’ll leave the speculation on what Stifel is trying to do up to you guys, but I do thank them for the better entry. I should also point out that Aphria/Tilray merger vote is on April 14, 2 days after earnings.

I like the stock.","['NOV', 'MMM']"

mlm0b0,,wallstreetbets,post,1617743939,"$SPY - The Coked Out Bull Who Outran Inflation - S&P 500 Trade ThesisWhat’s poppin’ fellas, I’ve got a trade thesis for y’all which I need picked apart. Although I spent a great deal of time discussing it with the greatest minds Twitter and Discord had to offer, I still can’t shake the feeling that this trade is pretty fuckin’ stupid at face value, so bare with me.

&nbsp;

I was a little drunk on Easter, and had an epiphany :

- SPY 100 - 200 took roughly 14 years.
- SPY 200 - 300 took 3.5 years.
- SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year.

&nbsp;

With the rate things are going, SPY 400 - 500 is looking like it’s set to happen in under a year, maybe even faster. Hell, in our current investing environment, I would be shocked to see SPY lower than 500 by the end of the year. Asset inflation is running rampant which is indirectly driving up the value of equities, we’re printing fuckloads of money with no end in sight, and money is flowing into the markets out the ass as investing becomes increasingly mainstream. I know a lot of people will doubt me for these things, but I’m thoroughly convinced that this is what modern day inflation looks like.

&nbsp;

/u/DustyBowls had an awesome writeup on this which can be found below :

---

&nbsp;

**The stock market is not a bubble. This is inflation. This is what modern inflation looks like. The federal government - Dem or Repub matters little, as Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden all did this - they hide the true inflation by excluding things from the inflation basket such as real estate. All the easy money, low interest rates and supermassive spending by Bernanke, Yellen, now JPow.**

&nbsp;

**This is why the upper middle class and to a much greater extent the rich can profit at all times - they're so heavily into stocks and other financial devices plus housing and land that the massive devaluation of the dollar and the explosion in inflation is not their problem - they just rise with the tide. Regular middle class and worker bees (the 99.6%) are seeing massive pay cuts in the form of inflation. You got a decent job making high five / low six figures and want to buy a place? Even in mid-size midwestern towns, the housing market is so hot that you just got priced out of the market. And you'll never get back into because this is not a bubble that will burst - this is inflation. The Federal government is going to print even more money and devalue the dollar so that its debt / GDP doesn't get too fuked. The rich don't care. The well-positioned middle class (a minority of the middle class) don't care. Everyone else should. You got a $600 or $1400 or $2500 stimulus check? Cool story the housing price and your rent just went up 10% compound for the next five years and you're far worse off than you were.**

&nbsp;

**It ain't a bubble it's a rising sea. If you aren't in a yacht or at least a skipper, you're fukin’ drowning man. Your flat salary, your savings account, your hourly wage - you just got a LOT poorer.**

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

By riding the coattails of the rich, we can look to become a lot less poor in the process. We’ve identified the trend, and now *we* can also rise with the tide. Ultimately, our end goal seems to be SPY 500. The price action over the past year reinforces this, as we’ve gone from $264 to $405 (over a 55% increase) during that time period. Hell, even the past decade of data supports us. **Every year from 2008 onwards, bar 2015 and 2018 have easily netted a 20% return.** If we see an increase that’s even remotely as good, we will be well ITM by the time our year is up. SPY 01/21/2022 500Cs are trading for $1.00. Dirt fuckin cheap. For more risk averse traders, we can go with a SPY 450C 01/21/2022 for $5.00 instead. Regardless of the chosen strikes, if these plays hit, it’s at minimum a 10 bagger, likely more.

&nbsp;

Personally, I’m going to look for an entry around SPY 400 since we’ve left some gnarly gaps, but I’m thoroughly convinced that we may continue to rip. We need less than a 20% increase in 10 months, which is well within reach. We’re in a fucked up investing landscape, which is heavily skewed towards exponential growth. All we need to do is take the leap of faith, and reap the reward in a couple of months. 

&nbsp;

All that being said, **I can’t think of a good bear thesis, so this is where I turn to y’all**. I’m not worried about the “bubble” popping, as I don’t think we’re in a bubble; This entire system is just a byproduct of the insane amounts of money we have printed. In my eyes, the only thing that can stop SPY 500 from happening is us getting nuked by North Korea, a new strain of super aids wiping out a good chunk of civilization, or aliens coming down and fucking some shit up. If any of those things happen however, we’ve got bigger problems than our SPY 500Cs expiring OTM. If anyone has a decent bear thesis, please lay it on me. 

&nbsp;

**__TLDR__**: Fuckloads of printed money combined with asset inflation will be a pretty nuts combo for the markets. Bears r fuk. Buy **SPY 01/21/2022 500C**.","['TWTR', 'SPGI']"

It looks like Palantir have time to answer the government's request till April 10 and probably by that time we should know the contract's worth.

I am by no means an expert when it comes to U.S Government contract awards, so feel free to correct me.

Palantir just trecently won a contract with the National Nuclear Security Administration and it looks like they won another one in the same sphere, but this time with the Air Force Nuclear Weapon Center.

mlmoxb,,wallstreetbets,post,1617745615,"Right Wing Billionaire, Charles Koch, Is Backing INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR CANNABIS. TilAphria 🚀🚀🚀 Trulieve 💩💩💩[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2021/04/06/charles-koch-snoop-dogg-marijuana-legalization-479148](here is the article)

Snoop Dogg and Charles Koch's group ""Americans for Prosperity(AFP)"" are working together to form the Cannabis Freedom Alliance (CFA). I know everyone is **shocked** by Snoop Dogg's support, but let's focus on the highly influential right wing group: AFP. 

>""Americans for Prosperity, founded by the Koch brothers in 2004, is one of the most influential organizations in conservative politics. The group rivals and even eclipses the official GOP in terms of its size, scope and spending.""

Directly from the article. So now cannabis is getting support from conservatives, in a big way, and conservatives **love** free and open markets. They will tell you where you can put your regulations, just ask em. So, on top of a **much better** chance of getting 10-12 Republicans to vote in favor of Cannabis, which is great news for everyone, this is also **AMAZING** news for Candian LP's like TilAphria, and bad news for MSOs like TruShit. I mean Trulieve. 

Don't believe me? According to one of the founders of the CFA (from the article): 

>""A lot of big cannabis companies are fighting against things like interstate commerce because it doesn’t support their business model,” Angelos said. “That’s another reason why [AFP] is a perfect ally on this because they support free and open markets.”

*Weeeeeeeeird*. Do you guys think it's ""big cannabis companies"" like TilAphria or other large LPs fighting the interstate commerce, or *maybe* ones like Trulieve who are desperately clinging on to their dying business models? If interstate commerce is allowed, it will cost LPs only **shipping costs** to send their products to all 50 states, and their juicy markets. They already sit on an excess of product and grow space, just waiting for bigger markets. 

Meanwhile, Trulieve spent 60m+ on 2 retail stores, then diluted. 🤦. So whatever markets they just spent 60m on, will eventually be available to everyone else (LPs and MSOs) for the **cost of shipping** to their stores or other new stores in the same area, post legalization with interstate commerce. No real long term cannabis company is focused on building a retail focused business. Just ask Curaleaf (read their ER) why their EU expansion is so exciting. They have **no** intentions of vertically integrating AND INSTEAD are building large manufacturing and distributing centers to serve large regions. Ya know, like Coke or Marlboro or Corona or literally any other CPG giant. Y'all been in a Coke owned store lately? Hm. How about the Corona ones? Hm.... Well, surely the Marlboro store? Those are everywhere!......

The kind of the interesting thing about the switch from a medical market to a recreational market is that 100% of the time, some of the the biggest opponents of the switch from medical to recreational are the current medical companies. Why would they want a bunch of new competition, regulations, and taxes? They don't. They fight the bills in the name of ""patients rights"" or some other made up bullshit. 

Then there's the other side of the coin. Once the switch from medical to recreational finally does happen, medical companies tend to find a lot less recreational companies wanting to work with them than they'd like. When you have to sit on the sidelines while someone else builds a monopoly, you aren't too keen to help them. 

Recreational business owners aren't stupid either. They are fully aware of those helping reinforce the ""status quo."" So, imagine you were to open a recreational marijuana dispensary after waiting for **years** in Florida, and a Trulieve sales rep walks in with their shitty logo on his shirt, how likely would *you* be to put their products on your shelf? I mean, why would you when there would be countless other brands to choose from with no retail presence? You wouldn't. It would make no sense. People who want Trulieve product can just go to a Trulieve store. Plus, wouldn't you purposefully **not**carry the same thing as your direct competitor, and especially their own in house brands? Unless you're ""Cookies,"" I just don't see that happening, and Trulieve AINT ""Cookies."" 

From a customer or ""patient"" perspective, in Florida, are you going to a Trulieve store for the 1,536th time after legalization, or ""Starbuds"" that just opened down the road with ""100+ new brands!"" sign out front?  Best case scenario would be Trulieve also adds a huge new line of other companies brands to their shelves, but is that really *good* news for them? They'd lose say 30-60% of their shelf space across all 70+ stores. That's gonna cause a surplus of weed for them pretty quickly.

They currently make so much money because they essentially own a monopoly on stores, and a monopoly on products within those stores. You want weed and live in FL? There's a 50% chance you're going to a Trulieve store, and a 100% chance you'll get a Trulieve product in that store. I've never seen something more ""priced in"" in my entire life, yet people still think Trulieve is going higher. Trulieve is only $40+ because of the *current* market regulations. Take away the favorable regulations, and you take away Trulieve, and get TruShit. 

Post legalization, each Trulieve store will just be one of **X** amount in a town selling weed. Florida currently has a dispensary ratio of around 1.1. Fully legal states have ratios closer to 10. Thats 10x the competition, just to get customers in the door. Even **if** they do come in Trulieve's door, they may not even buy a Trulieve product since they would be forced to carry other brands as well as their own.

Not every MSO is fighting for a fully legal market, and it's pretty obvious to point out the ones who could potentially be **hurt** the most by a free and open market. TruShit being king among them. In my retarded opinion, wholesale focused MSOs and LPs are much much much better long term options for a legal market. Stop investing in a dying medical market, 🤷.

(TIP FOR THE DAY) For those who do not know what the fuck a standard deviation is (this is for the smooth brains) basically the stock volume is trading outside of where 95% of the volume should occur on average (2 standard deviations is where 95% of the volume should occur). Means someone with fat wads of cash is buying. Please for the love of god if you do not know what standard deviation is look it up. Learning is good for apes.

There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. 
 
&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. 
 
&nbsp;
  
Ok, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. 
 
&nbsp;
 
**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**
 
&nbsp;
 
Hedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: 
 
1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. 
  
2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  
 
&nbsp;

 
Retailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. 
   
&nbsp;

Let's look at the short interest over time for ASO: 
 
&nbsp;

|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|
|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|
|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|
|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|
|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|

&nbsp;

We can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. 
 
&nbsp;

Most shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. 

&nbsp;

Some may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, 
&nbsp;


>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.
&nbsp;


So, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. 

&nbsp;
 
**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**

&nbsp;
 
[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  
 
&nbsp;

Did someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: 
 
&nbsp;

|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|
--:|:--|:--|
|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|
|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|
|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|
|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|
|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|

&nbsp;
 
Price at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. 
 
&nbsp;

Let's see that in a table:

Now, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew.

I'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. 
  
&nbsp;

**Indicators** 
 
I don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) ""crossing over"" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). 

&nbsp;
 
**Conclusion** 
&nbsp;

For me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store.

&nbsp;

Positions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.
 
&nbsp;

Edit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps ""gapping up"", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.

 
&nbsp;

Edit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30. Will assume that is the floor for now.",['GPS']

mlok9n,,wallstreetbets,post,1617750828,"MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy OutOkay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.

The good stuff:

1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.
The basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.

The other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).

This is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.

Now that we’ve covered the basics in Lehman’s terms, let’s move on to the strategic outlay.


In january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men’s prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.

Before this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. 

Myovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).

It’s my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. 

Without a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.

Myovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.

I plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla 🚀 🚀 🚀 

TLDR:
Company has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. 

🚀 Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22

Quick about me: I’ve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years. My past plays include riding Tesla from $100 presplit, sunrun from $6, and of course GME from $10 all the way up to $400.

mm2pnl,,wallstreetbets,post,1617803996,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compare to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companies

Arcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.

It all started last year in February of 2020 right when the pandemic was really starting to batter the U.S. 

I was playing some 5/5/15 PLO at my buddies game, when my friend who we all just call “milk man” began to open his stupid mouth about how “this and that” is going to send the price of sweet cream butter skyrocketing because of some bullshit about how grocery stores will be understocked and Martha will need a fuck ton of sweet cream butter to feed the family while everyone’s stuck at home. We all call him milk man because he’s literally a cow milker, has a big farm, and always wears this hat with a cow on it. 

I use derogatory language when regarding milk man now, but then, his stack was tall and mine was short. I was tilted and also drunk when something in me clicked and said “this is it. butter futures is the yolo that will make me rich.” I was working a great job in finance at the time and had some capital to work with.

I listened to milk man go on and on about butter for the rest of the night. The next morning, Monday. I yolo’d into CME cash-settled butter futures expiring March 15th, 2020. Naive me at the time thought COVID would be over with within a couple of months.

Then it all went to fucking shit. 

So supposedly I didn’t yolo into sweet cream butter futures but I just flat out yolod into butter futures. I honestly didn’t even know what the fuck I was doing but I just figured all butter was going up crazy so it didn’t matter. Well I was dead wrong. 

These fucking worthless dairy farmers couldn’t keep up with the demand so they began to either put palm oil into the butter or the fed the cows too much palm oil to the point that it got into the butter. I’m still not sure what they did, but it doesn’t matter. Half of god damn Canada was complaining that their butter is rock solid at room temperature. How the fuck do you expect them to spread it on toast? It was a disaster. Butter tanked. I was ruined. 

Fast forward a year later and looking back it’s all not so bad. I have a really steady job now and the pay is pretty good. The only downside is every time I’m milking cows on milk mans farm he says the same dumb joke every time. 

“Make sure that’s sweet cream milk and not regular milk!”

mljqb9,,wallstreetbets,post,1617737570,"Key differences between RKT and ASOI''m seeing a lot of posts on ASO, with some of them comparing to the RKT situation in early March. I want to clarify a few key differences here. This post is NOT saying ASO is a bad investment, I'm sure their excellent earnings indicate that their business is going strong. I'm only trying to show that, in my opinion, a RKT-like gamma squeeze is *unlikely*.

So first thing, we have to understand that the RKT squeeze is primarily a gamma squeeze - the price blew up 20% initially, getting close to the highest strikes available at the time, and then steadily grew to over 70% over the course of the day. If you look at the share cost distribution (below), you will notice a big block between \~$28 to \~$40. I've been tracking this since the squeeze and it has not changed. What happened was that institutions were selling naked calls (because RKT was trading flat forever before the spike), and they were forced to buy shares to hedge, creating a gamma squeeze. Institutional holdings recorded at the end of dec was about 74%, suggesting that there could have been a good number of exposed naked calls. If it were primarily driven by a short squeeze, this big block would not exist.

https://preview.redd.it/7x37a6m7olr61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18a030afd647c5d87ef3fff2f618483452de072d

On the other hand, what is ASO's situation? ASO has 91.6% institutional ownership. I would suspect most of the calls that are sold are already covered. ASO has been trending up since its IPO anyways so there wouldn't be as many naked thetagang as RKT before the spike. Thus, I highly doubt a gamma squeeze can happen. What about a short squeeze? Of course this can happen as the short interest is high, but unless millions of apes jump in like GME (unlikely since they are already in GME) or a whale buys in (also highly highly unlikely). The high institutional ownership also means that lots of shares will be available to be lent out, and shorts will have a hell of a time if any spike happens.

With this in mind, investors in ASO should tread lightly. I would probably suggest getting shares if you are bullish and not options.",
mljqb9,gtm48d5,wallstreetbets,comment,1617742593,"I thought the key driver of gamma squeeze is high open interest on call options —> market makers holding the other side of the trade have to hedge by buying shares —> price goes up —> mms have to buy more shares, etc. Sure, traders who are short naked calls could contribute to the squeeze but I don’t think it’s the main factor.

[edit] to expand on this idea, since gamma squeeze essentially increases demand of a limited supply of shares, the # of shares outstanding becomes important. Insider ownership of rkt is huge, the public float is ~100 million but shares outstanding is actually 2B! That’s why the volume is so high (avg 15 million). I’m not sure about the details about how / when insider shares can become public float but the general idea is that higher shares outstanding makes a stock harder to squeeze, all else equal. ASO on the other hand has a 30 million public float and only 90m total shares outstanding! So, the threshold for gamma squeeze is lower and hence the chances are higher for a massive squeeze. Open interest on ASO options have exploded over the past week. Additionally the exchange listed new 45 strike calls today. The 30+% short interest is just additional fuel.",

[1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)

[2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/)

First of all I want to say fucking GUH to my fellow NVAX brethren that have been riding this tendie rollercoaster with me. This is not for the faint of heart but I'm still positive on the outlook of this stock. Here are the negative events that have sent the stock down and my rebuttals to them:

**1) US approval of JnJ vaccine and additional orders of MRNA and PFE** \- The US at this point is pretty loaded with vaccine doses, we have enough as it is without NVAX to vaccinate all the US. This leads to the common misconception that NVAX is too late to the party and has missed out. However, the US is still going to purchase 110 million doses from NVAX no matter what once it is approved. The deal is already made. The US gov funded NVAX to get these doses they will not just refuse to buy them. Despite this I still insist the US market share DOES NOT MATTER. Here are a list of other deals NVAX has lined up

* [SHIT TONS](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) of manufacturing deals leading to production of 2+ BILLION doses every year across the world
* [1.1 BILLION dose deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with COVAX the majority of which will be vaccines from NVAX
* [40 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement) to South Korea
* [6 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-government-switzerland-announce-agreement-principle) to the Swiss
* [76 Million Doses + Manufacturing Deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-produce-covid-19) to our Poutine eating brethren
* [51 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-finalizes-agreement-commonwealth-australia-51-million) to Australians
* [10.7 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-agreement-government-new-zealand-107-million) to the Kiwis
* [60 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to the British

**2) EU deal talks with NVAX fall apart citing manufacturing concerns -** OK this one sounds bad I admit. Could it be? NVAX can't actually secure enough of its raw materials to make vaccines for the EU? If they can't even do that how are we supposed to expect them to be able to make vaccines for the rest of the world? The truth is that NVAX was the one that refused to sign the deal with the EU. As demonstrated in [this article](https://www.thepavlovictoday.com/andrew-bridgen-mp-the-eu-and-ursula-von-der-leyen-set-out-to-teach-astrazeneca-a-lesson-but-only-shown-that-they-need-to-learn-one-themselves/) the EU has been an incredibly litigious vaccine customer and has made AZ's life hell. Hence why the EU has been [doing poorly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/06/eu-blames-astrazeneca-failure-for-sluggish-covid-vaccine-rollout) as far as vaccine rollout goes. Basically, NVAX has more than enough customers that are less troublesome than the EU willing to buy their product and NVAX only has so many doses readily available, why sell to the EU when you can sell to others?

&#x200B;

**3) Insider selling** \- If you sell your positions when you see a headline about an insider selling stock you should really reconsider this investing hobby thing and go into buying beanie babies or whatever the fuck you feel more comfortable with because you'll never make money or be able to hug your kids with such fragile paper hands. Execs sell their stock all the time, they schedule selling months ahead of time or just want the money. In fact, NVAX execs were selling their stock at $125 just days before Phase 3 data came out that sent NVAX to $300+. It simply has not been indicative of catastrophic news. 

**4) General market pullback** \- As many of you are aware the market has been extremely rocky in March and NVAX is not immune to this. In fact, being such a high beta stock it is more vulnerable. Biotech has been absolutely slammed by the market in March which makes this a PERFECT buying opportunity.

&#x200B;

Now onto the good stuff - two catalysts I expect this month:

**1) UK Approval -** NVAX has completed its UK Phase 3 trial and the results look GREAT. At 96% efficacy it's the best performing vaccine reported to date. It already had submitted data to the UK as part of a rolling review and should get the approval by the [end of April](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-2021-03-30). I cannot stress this enough, I do **not** think approval has been priced in. This would be the very first approval that NVAX has ever received and will finally validate it as a profitable company with a future. Canada, Australia, and NZ would very shortly follow in approvals if this passes in the UK.

**2) US Phase 3 Results -** This will likely take investors by surprise! NVAX enrolled their phase 3 trial in record time which allowed them to get started much earlier than anticipated. Additionally, with 30,000 participants this trial is much larger than the UK trial and they will likely reach their endpoint targets in much less time than what the UK trial took. In fact, this US phase 3 trial [started crossover studies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/novavax-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-trials-to-children-teens-2021-04-05) which potentially indicates the interim endpoints have already been reached AND they are now expanding the trial to include children and teens. We were hoping for a long time that the FDA would use the UK phase 3 data but now we might not even have to wait for that.

&#x200B;

Other positive news/useful info:

**1) This stock has gone through tremendous de-risking.** At $180 a share NVAX is almost down to the price it was before Phase 3 data came out. It can't fall much more, and at a market cap of 12.9 Bn it is grossly undervalued.

**2) Other covid developements -** a) NVAX announced in their earnings call that SA variant trials would begin by the start of the summer and that these would be solely safety-based. If the original vaccine is approved for efficacy these would not have to demonstrate such rigorous efficacy data. b) NanoFlu+Covid or NanoFlu+Covid+RSV vaccine trials are supposed to start by the end of the year.

This is my first post here, so if there are some aspects not to your liking, please let me know.

I am a pattern trader, and today I noticed a double bottom forming and other entry signals on Walmart (WMT) :

Here is an overview of the situation and the move I will be making on it when I get confirmation:

**The catalysts :**

* Double bottom pattern
* 50 day moving average (MA) breakout.

Now, when there is more than one signal forming on a single stock, the probability of the trade going your way is much higher than when there is just one signal.

**The play**

Today I will wait for confirmation of the breakout (the stock trades higher than yesterday's close) and I will enter using the following **setup:**

**Entry price :** 140$ (breakout confirmation)

**Stop loss :** 137.5$ ( half way through yesterday's bar - breakout failure - setup not valid anymore)

**Risk :** 2.5$/sh

**Target :** 147.5$ ( the next resistance level, also the target level of the double bottom)

**Profit :** 7.5$/sh

**Risk/reward :** 3:1

mlc389,,wallstreetbets,post,1617716996,"The Billy Hwang Gang Bang and Why I Am Still Balls Deep In $VIACAIn a [previous post from last Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhp1fe/spongebob_vs_hwang_gang_and_the_banks/), I outlined why I thought $VIACA would moon like $DISCB. I bought the calls, envisioned the massive money I was going to make, and was promptly kicked in the dick. I am ride or die so you can bet your ass I am still in the trade.

The premise was that the big banks that were holding the Billy Hwang’s Archegos’ bag, most notably Credit Suisse and Nomura, were about done with selling. As it turns out, the risk management department at Credit Suisse is more retarded than I thought, and Monday’s trading was still filled with lots more selling.

**What changed**

In the afterhours last night, Credit Suisse showed just how shit their risk management department is by revealing that they only managed to sell 3m of its 37m $VIACA/$VIAC shares over the course of a week. Credit Suisse is running/ran a sale process in the afterhours tonight to [get out of their remaining 34m shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/credit-suisse-said-to-offer-viacomcbs-vipshop-farfetch-blocks). I speculate Credit Suisse’s large, unmoved block of shares was an open secret around the Street and inspired traders to keep pressing shorts until Credit Suisse visibly raised the white flag. Well, we know Credit Suisse has now folded.

With the Credit Suisse selling out of the way, I am guessing that there will be a lot of short covering and rebuys coming in the next week or so to conclude the trade on the short side. My preferred way to play Viacom is with $VIACA for the same reason $DISCB was the way to play Discovery. I believe $VIACA is now primed for takeoff and will probably buy more tomorrow because I am a degenerate.

**TL;DR**

VIACA 4/16 $50c, $60c, $65c, and $70c

Most options expire worthless and these probably will too.","['VIAC', 'MMM']"

mkk7u7,,wallstreetbets,post,1617627889,"On January 25th I went to rehab, holding GameStop. That same day it exploded to >$100. Have now been sober for over two months and this sub has changed my life in the processAs I mentioned [over two months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2wx2p/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gkfnqqi/?context=3https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2wx2p/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gkfnqqi/?context=3), I was going to rehab holding GME, and I checked in on Jan 25th. During the first couple of days, I was seeing you all on TV and it really made my days. I was so proud of this sub. Before leaving, I had set my limit orders and then didn't have any computer access until January 29th.

In the meantime, most of my limit orders hit. When I finally got computer access on the 29th for five mins, I sold the rest of my holding.

I've now been completely sober for over two months for the first time since my early teens. For a while I had wanted to do something special for my parents as they're getting older. With this GME money I was able to buy them a car, straight cash.

**Now that I'm back, only one question remains. What is the next YOLO?!**

Edit: Also wanted to congratulate my man u/Deepfuckingvalue I guessed [he would reach $50 milly](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2x7he/gme_yolo_update_jan_22_2021/gk8s4id/?context=3) and he did at one point

mkk7u7,gtgg1y8,wallstreetbets,comment,1617632738,"Congrats on the recovery dude. You should know, the rate of co-morbid substance and gambling addiction is incredibly high. “The next YOLO” definitely doesn’t sound like healthy and thoughtful investing. And while I know everyone shits on that here, your buying pattern on GME wasn’t a YOLO, it was a thoughtful strategy that you leveled into and sold thoughtfully. Don’t let the rush of a huge win make you into a gambling addict now that you don’t have the rush for drugs. **Think seriously about joining the theta gang** now that you’ve got the capital to do so, especially in this market condition. 

Again, congrats on the recovery. It’s a hard fought win and don’t take your eye off the ball.
