**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

mb52jz,,stocks,post,1616468640,"Why Microsoft would want to acquire Discord, which is reportedly exploring a $10B-plus salehttps://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-want-acquire-discord-reportedly-exploring-10b-plus-sale/

Discord is a popular app used by millions of gamers for low-latency voice chat and other communication. Due to social distancing measures and the general growth of the video game industry, Discord nearly doubled its userbase and saw revenue spike to $130 million in 2020. It was valued at $7 billion in December, and is reportedly is not yet profitable.

That would seem to leave Microsoft as the last real domestic contender here. It has pre-existing ties to Discord, as you can already link your Xbox account directly to the service; it’s certainly got the money, with $131 billion in total cash as of Dec. 31; and it’s reportedly still in the market for more gaming-focused acquisitions, even after finalizing its purchase of ZeniMax Media earlier this month.

This is a positive move to acquire discord. It will make msft more competitive and improve social media business, which might make it able to compete with facebook. It will definitely help the gaming business as well as msft putting more effort to improve the gaming revenue.","['FB', 'MSFT']"

 Microsoft offered to buy Pinterest a few weeks ago but PINS turned them down so they went down the line and bought Discord instead. Watch them try to gobble up Clubhouse next. MSFT is playing chess while their competitors are playing checkers.",['MSFT']

mauium,,stocks,post,1616437919,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Ai**
   * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD**
   * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD**
   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

mbbcjc,,stocks,post,1616493944,"Investors: Make sure you all understand and know how to calculate your “Break-Even Rate”.With regard to purchasing power, Inflation and taxes can easily erode your profits/gains over time. Especially when you enter and exit trades consistently over the long-term or if your investments are placed in a non-tax sheltered account. 

Your break-even rate is the rate of return you need to make just to keep up your purchasing power level, not including brokerage fees.

To calculate, first estimate the rate of inflation you expect to experience over the next year, you can refer to the Bureau of Labour statistics (BLS) which also publishes the Consumer price index (CPI) which is a measure of inflation. (For the U.S)

To calculate your break-even rate you can use the formula: (i) / (100 - E) = B


B: Break-even rate
I: Inflation 
E: Effective tax-rate 

Ex. If you assume a (2%) inflation over the coming year and your combined tax rate is 44% then your break even rate is: 

2% / (100 - 44) = (3.6%). 

3.6% “Net” on your portfolio to maintain your purchasing power. Earning this rate does not provide any real profits, it only maintains the value of your investments.

If you are earning less than your break-even rate after taxes and inflation have been taken into account, you are actually losing money on your total investments and may have to accept high risk just to maintain your purchasing power.",
mbbcjc,grx58nx,stocks,comment,1616501826,I would argue that because inflation hits everyone and every dollar the exact same it is irrelevant. Taxes are important to understand though.,
mbbcjc,grxk6sd,stocks,comment,1616509639,"Everyone arguing with OP doesn't understand economics. An example: I am not American. I trade with USD in US markets but my broker settles in local currency. Even if I convert all of my account into USD my buying power, etc is based on local currency, not USD. Last week while my stocks were going up, my account went down because the USD was worth less than it was when I bought my shares.

Even if you are American and exclusively trading on US markets, inflation makes your money worth less. ""Everyone's dollars are worth the same amount"" is a bad argument, because the dollar losing value affects your buying power, maybe not in the US stock market per se, but in literally everything else. If a jug of milk used to cost $2 and  it later costs $5 you have less buying power, your money is worth less. That's inflation",
mbbcjc,grxq0cz,stocks,comment,1616512241,"Good point!

And also don't forget currency aspects (for example, for EU investors buying US stocks in USD).

So in the formula above, you can include your currency depreciation/appreciation in ""i"" in the formula above. 

Example, a year ago, 1 USD was about 0.93 Euros, and now it is 0.84 (a 9.6% decrease in dollar value). That means, if you bought a stock at 100 USD exactly a year ago, the stock price has to be at least 109.6 USD now to break even (without considering the tax and inflation aspects above).",
mba9nk,,stocks,post,1616489129,"$CODX shining this week!!$CODX is an undervalued covid play with earnings coming up on Thursday! WSJ has a price target of $30-$40 which is 2-3xs higher than closing price. It was the best quarter ever thanks to its patented covid tests. They also just announced a partnership with Walgreens for their latest patented product, a covid saliva test. Closed yesterday at $14 (a 5% gain), and is up over 35% in the last two weeks. 

Also calls are still dirt cheap, the $15 call closed at $.75!

mba9nk,grwtj4p,stocks,comment,1616492505,"I too own and like the stock.  I have owned the stock and watched the stock since the first days of the Pandemic and it's been an entertaining ride.  

However, before you throw too much into expiring call options, I encourage you to look at the price movement of the stock after the last 3-4 earnings reports.

I'll give you an early taste. The stock tanked...every....single...time.  The stock then recovers, does a little dance, and of course tanks again.  

It's because the company has had a hard time turning a great product, and a huge testing need into sales growth.  

I think every quarter the market predicts an earning surprise leading up to earnings, much of what you are seeing now, because of the overwhelming need for testing.  But instead codx has delivered a earning miss more or less every quarter.  

The expectations finally might be more realistic this time, and they might still have an earning surprise waiting for us, but recent history is hard to ignore. 

Again, I like the tech, I like the fundamentals of the company, and I like potential going forward, however I would not invest more into call options than I do into the actual stock as the only options that have paid at earning recently are puts.

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. 

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. 

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud** 

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! 

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. 

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. 

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. 

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends and has netted shareholders billions. 

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|

|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. 

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. 

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.","['AMZN', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'MSFT', 'NFLX', 'CRM', 'GOOGL', 'NI']"

mb14ej,,stocks,post,1616456207,"The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market MakersAs more retail investors become interested in investing in the financial markets, the more information available to the general public, the better.

Recently, there have been some [Congressional hearings in the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html) in the wake of the ongoing Gamestop saga in which questions have been  raised over the practice of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which has become more common and a core part of the business model for no commission trading pioneered by Robinhood.

While  PFOF is not a new practice, it is seemingly becoming more common as  more brokerages follow Robinhood's model in order to compete for the burgeoning retail trading business.  At least in the US, it appears fewer brokerages are now offering the traditional commission based trading structure:  Fidelity, Merrill Edge, Interactive Brokers (but not their newer ""IBKR Lite"" platform) are some examples (are there more?).

PFOF is banned in at least two other jurisdictions: the UK and Canada.

Rightly maligned for his prior fradulent behaviour in his pump and dump ""boiler-room"" schemes where he took up to $200 million from investors, the infamous ""Wolf of Wall Street"" recently gave an interview in which  he discussed the topic at hand, shedding a bit more light on the practice:

[Fortune interview with Jordan Belfort, the ""Wolf of Wall Street""](https://fortune.com/2021/03/21/bitcoin-stock-market-jordan-belfort-small-investors-wolf-of-wall-street-interview/)

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising  how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive  window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information    disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""  
>  
>..  
>  
>In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and  keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

mbje8f,,stocks,post,1616519103,"Taseko mines (TGB)# Taseko Mines (TSE:TKO) (AMEX:TGB) - Copper is Near All Time High - This Low Cost Producer is Taking Advantage (DD)

&#x200B;

With copper prices near an all-time high and demand growing I wanted to find a decent junior mining company that is undervalued. Taseko stood out because they have been running in the red for a number of years but have started turning it around and will likely be profitable this year.

Summary

* Copper prices are rising and near 8-year highs with demand expected to grow
* Taseko currently produces copper at a cost of $1.92/lb – current price is $4.1/lb and is hedged well against downside price risk. They are taking advantages of high copper prices
* An environmentally friendly and low-cost mine under development in Arizona is going through final permitting, and if approved this would be a significant boost to their operation

Taseko Mines Overview

Taseko Mines is a dynamic and growing mining company focused on the operation and development of mines in North America. Headquartered in Vancouver, Taseko operates the state-of-the-art Gibraltar Mine, **the second largest copper mine in Canada**, with a nearly 700 person workforce producing an average of **140 million pounds of copper** and 2.5 million pounds of molybdenum per year. **Taseko’s wholly-owned Florence Copper**, Yellowhead, and Aley projects are all **advanced staged projects that provide the company with a diverse commodity pipeline**

Market Outlook

I highlighted two key articles below - essentially copper demand is increasing and supply is dropping, which is starting to be reflected by the price of copper.

**Copper price to rise in 2021: analysts** (SP Global – link [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/011821-copper-price-to-rise-in-2021-analysts))

* Copper to flip into deficit
* Chinese stimulus to support demand
* Decarbonization bullish for metal

""Of all the metals used in the generation, transmission, storage, and consumption, copper remains the common denominator,"" Stifel said. ""Electricity generation, transmission infrastructure, energy storage, and consumption all require copper.""

**Copper supply expected to move into deficit in 2021.** (Mining - link [here](https://www.mining.com/copper-supply-expected-to-move-into-deficit-in-2021-says-stonex/))

Copper was already **trading near eight-year highs** in January but prices for the red metal surged again in mid-February, with March contracts reaching $4.12 per lb. on Feb. 22 – **nearing an all-time high of $4.58 per lb**. in 2011, as investors bet that supply **tightness will increase as the world gradually recovers from the covid-19 pandemic.**

Price of Copper and Taseko’s Hedge

As a mining company a lot of their value ties to the price of copper (I know, pretty obvious\*\*) Price of Copper is $4.1/lb as of writing this analysis\*\*. This bodes well for Taseko, which we will discuss a little further down in the analysis. Taseko also employees a hedging strategy, like a decent commodity production company should, to limit their downside risk

Taseko’s hedging strategy is designed to secure a minimum price for a significant portion of their near term production through the purchase of copper put options. Put options maturing over the first half of 2021: 7.5Mlbs at US$2.80/lb for Q1 and 30Mlbs at US$3.20/lb for H1 (Page 25 – Link [here](https://www.tasekomines.com/assets/docs/presentations/Taseko_Senior_Secured_Notes_Offering.pdf))

&#x200B;

Summary of how this works: Buyers of put options can hedge their downside price risk for a period of time and still **benefit from potential price gains if the market should increase**. Once the premium is paid, the put buyer has no further obligation. **Depending on price movements, the producer can either accept or leave the guaranteed price.**

This leaves Taseko in great position to take advantage of high copper prices and limit downside risk.

Mine Overview

**Gibraltar – Copper Mine in BC – Currently Operating**

* Taseko bought this mine in 1999 for $1. Can you believe that? Interesting piece of info
* On a cost per ton milled basis, **Gibraltar is one of the lowest cost operations in the world**.
* Cash cost of US$1.80/lb to produce copper
* Has produced an average of $125 Million lbs of copper on an annual basis

**Florence Copper Project – Arizona – Development Phase**

* Currently in the development phase – permitting in is process with the EPA. All major power, transportation, road and rail infrastructure are in place. Once complete, Florence will be one of the greenest sources of copper in the US
* Annual production capacity of 85 million pounds
* Permitting and construction to take place throughout 2021 and production will start in 2022
* After-tax NPV(7.5%) of US$680 million and an IRR of 37% and a 2.5 year payback

**Note on permitting.** This can make or break a mining company. Approval is obviously great, but denial can significantly impact share price of the company. In a recent SEC filing Taseko addressed the timeline for the permit process. The paragraph below highlights a positive outlook Taseko has about the upcoming approval

On December 8, 2020, the Company received the Aquifer Protection Permit (""APP"") permit from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (""ADEQ""). The APP permit was issued following a public comment period and public hearing in August 2020 where the project received strong support from local community members, business owners and elected officials. The other required permit is the **Underground Injection Control (""UIC"") Permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA""). The EPA's technical review for the UIC permit has identified no significant issues and the Company expects to receive this permit in the coming month.** link [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000878518/000106299321002406/exhibit99-1.htm)

Highlights from Recent Earnings Call – Feb 25, 2021

I pulled a few highlights from a recent earnings call. In summary, they are one o the lowest cost copper producers in the world and their Florence mine adds significant value to Taseko.

* CEO “We run our mining operations at the highest level we can in the lowest operating cost we can achieve. And on top of that, we ensure that our capital discipline is a No. 1 priority for us. **We produced 123 million pounds of copper for the year at a cash cost of $1.92 a pound**,
* Florence is one of the lowest capex intensity copper projects in the world. **It also has a low operating cost of $1.10 a pound**. And it's a green project that will **produce refined copper capital with 90% less carbon emissions than a conventional mine.** This will become a new U.S. domestic supply of green metal that fits very well into government plans for renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle manufacturing.
* CFO “Florence has a net present value of 680 million based on our 2017 technical report using a $3 copper price. With funding substantially in hand and removing that capex in that model, that increases the funded NPV of Florence up to 900 million or USD 3.25 per share. And **if I run that funded Florence model using 3.50 copper price, it's USD 4 per share**. And at today's copper price of 4.30 per pound, I see an NPV of USD 5.50 per share.”

Financial Highlights and Comparables

* **Analyst Price Target** \- Average: $2.63 and High: $3.00
* **Price to Book**: Taseko has a PB Ratio of 2x compared to the CA Metals and Mining industry average 2.8x. A lower P/B ratio could mean the stock is undervalued.
* **Quick Ratio: 1.25** \- The quick ratio is important for evaluating mining companies because of the substantial capital expenditures and financing necessary for mining operations. Analysts and creditors prefer to see quick ratio values higher than 1, the minimum acceptable value
* **Debt Level:** TKO's debt to equity ratio at **1.1450 which is high**. For comparison Copper Mountain Mining Corp has a D/E ratio of 0.6 and a similar market cap

Comparables with CMMC📷

One interesting thing I came is across is in a recent Copper Mountain Mining presentation they highlight their Eva project is relatively “cheap” from a capital expenditure perspective at $3.87 which is about half the average CAPEX/LOM. However they also include the Florence mine, the one under development for Taseko, **and it has a CAPEX/LOM of $2.35, which is 60% Less than the Eva project**. Link [here](https://www.cumtn.com/site/assets/files/4379/cmmc_q4_2020_conference_call_vfinal.pdf)

Risk

* **EPA Permit does not get approved** – this is unlikely but Taseko is banking on this project coming through as this mine is one of their key assets.
* **ROE: -0.07** \- Average ROEs in the mining industry range between 5% and 9%, with the best-performing companies producing ROEs closer to 15% or more. The ratio is calculated by dividing net income by stockholders' equity.
* **Long Term Liabilities**: TKO's short term assets $157.2Mdo not cover its long term liabilities CA$514.5M.

TLDR

Copper demand is increasing, supply is decreasing, and the price of copper has therefore increased. Taseko is one of the lowest cost copper producers, with a great existing asset, and they are nearing the final stages of developing another low cost and environmentally friendly mine. They are waiting on EPA approval, and if approved, the CFO has projected a value of $4.00 per share.

mbfkvv,,stocks,post,1616508695,"When to get outI've been in the market since the end of January, meme stocks got me interested but I realized at that point I was more likely to lose money than make it buying them. Some of the stocks I've bought over the past almost two months have hit either 52wk, or all time, highs. Some climbing over 10% during that time. 

If the stock's growth was largely the result of the market as a whole going up during that time, as opposed to being propelled by its own merits, would I be better to get out or to hold? 

For example, one of them, MUFG, is a Japanese bank that is just over $5.80 a share. Aside from a day where it eclipsed the $6 mark last week it hasn't been this high since 2018 (on anything resembling a consistent basis). They do pay a decent dividend, and have been fairly consistent, but without much room for growth it doesn't seem that holding makes much sense. 

Without any news or rumors indicating room for potential growth of the company, my thought is sell before my gains slowly slip away and out the money into something with the potential for more immediate growth. 

I've gotten fairly decent about knowing when to get in, admittedly I bought MUFG when I didn't know and got lucky, I'm still not great at knowing when to get out. Obviously if something is tanking and news comes out that's not going to change, that's easy. I struggle with determining when to get out when I'm up. 

Are my thoughts on it looking like there's no room for additional growth right? 

I'm trying not to make decisions based on emotions, but I also need a better grasp of prevailing logic to do that. I'm sure there are indicators that make long term become short term, short term become swing stocks, and swing stocks become bad ideas.",
mbfkvv,grxp4bg,stocks,comment,1616511839,"One way is to use a discounted cash flow valuation to find out the intrinsic value of a stock. This is what I do.

If the share price rises above the intrinsic value per share that you get then it makes sense to sell. Now this only makes sense to do a DCF if you fully understand the company otherwise it can give you confidence in the wrong numbers.

If it's hugely below then it makes sense to buy (margin of safety).

I like Prof. Aswath Damodaran's spreadsheets the best for this. You can use his spreadsheet here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA)

I also created an automated version of this spreadsheet to do it faster, here's an example I did for IRobot that shows this: [https://tracktak.com/stock/irbt-us/discounted-cash-flow](https://tracktak.com/stock/irbt-us/discounted-cash-flow?cagrYearOneToFive=0.18&ebitTargetMarginInYearTen=0.1&yearOfConvergence=3&salesToCapitalRatio=2.5)

And here is Aswath's site: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/)

He posts all his courses for free too to help you value stocks.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-23.html)

*****

> # 1. S&P 500 set to drop on anniversary of stock bull market

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 broke two-session losing streaks. The Nasdaq logged a second straight session of gains, recovering about half of Thursday’s 3% decline. Tech stocks benefited over the past two sessions from the 10-year Treasury yield retreating from last week’s 14-month high. Tuesday marks one year since the Covid low in the stock market, which ended the fastest bear market ever and ushered in another bull market. The S&P 500 has gained 76% since the March 23, 2020 close of 2,237. Over the past year, two presidents, Congress and the Federal Reserve put extraordinary fiscal and monetary policies in place to support the economy during the pandemic.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell to testify on Capitol Hill on economic recovery

> * Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testify Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee on the economy at 12 p.m. ET. Yellen, who was Powell’s predecessor, said she sees both growth and possibly full employment next year. She credits President Joe Biden’s Covid relief package. For his part, Powell’s prepared remarks struck a cautiously optimism tone, saying the economy is “much improved” but the recovery is “far from complete.” Last week, after its March meeting, the Fed forecasted higher growth and inflation, while saying interest rates will likely remain near zero through 2023.

*****

> # 3. U.S. officials: AstraZeneca may have included outdated data

> * An independent group of U.S. health advisors said Tuesday that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in its Covid vaccine trial results. The questions came one day after the U.K. drug maker said a late-stage trial in U.S. and in Latin America showed 79% efficacy for its two-shot regimen. The Data Safety Monitoring Board expressed concern about whether the material provided by AstraZeneca created an “incomplete view of the efficacy data.” AstraZeneca, which said Monday it planned to file for FDA emergency use authorization next month, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

*****

> # 4. Covid cases rise in parts of U.S. as some states relax restrictions

> * New Covid cases are once again on the rise across more than half of the U.S., as health officials warn about reopening too soon and race to vaccinate more people before highly contagious strains become prevalent in the country. As of Sunday, the seven-day average of new cases rose by 5% or more in 27 states, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Across the U.S., the nation logged an average of 54,308 new cases per day over the past week, a 1% rise from the prior week after months of rapidly declining case numbers.

*****

> # 5. Biden considers $3 trillion package for infrastructure

> * Biden is assembling the next big White House priority, a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That would be on top of his recently signed $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus. The president met privately late Monday with Senate Democrats as Congress has already begun laying the groundwork with legislation for developing roads, hospitals and green energy systems as part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” campaign promise. While the goal is a bipartisan package, Democrats in Congress have signaled a willingness to go it alone if they’re blocked by Republicans.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

mbfsne,,stocks,post,1616509337,"ADBE - a closer look at alternative data pointsI’ve been thinking about buying ADBE for a long time and with the stock 15% below its 52-week high (and earnings coming up), this might be a good buying opportunity. So before I made my decision, I decided to look at some [alternative data points](https://dillibits.com/?t=ADBE). This is what I found.

**Not a popular stock on social media**

Adobe is only being mentioned a handful of times per day on social media platforms such as Reddit and StockTwits. But the bullish sentiment is high, currently sitting at 78%.

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, we can see some minor growth with about 20 new followers per day on Facebook and 320 new followers on Instagram.

**Traffic is going up**

Despite the “low interest” on social media, web traffic for Adobe is significantly up. [Adobe.com](http://adobe.com/) had an estimate of 129M visitors in February, up by almost 20% since September last year.

The Adobe Target product is growing in popularity which could be an indicator of growth for Adobe’s Marketing products.

**Customer Satisfaction remains high**

Adobe's Net Promoter Score (NPS) is sitting at 39 (a good score since [NPS](https://www.comparably.com/brands/adobe#nps) is a grade from -100 to 100) with 60% Promoters, 19% Passives, and 21% Detractors. And that number gets even more impressive when longterm clients are surveyed. Clients that have used Adobe’s products for over 10 years gives the company a 67.

**Increase in patents**

Innovation never sleeps at Adobe, at least not if you’re looking at patent fillings. Just in the last quarter, Adobe has added over 200 patents to their portfolio. Now this is on par with companies such as Oracle and Salesforce, but it’s still an impressive number. Some of their latest [patents](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0000796343) focuses on machine learning and neural networks - lots of cool innovative ideas!

**Workforce is growing and employees are satisfied**

According to their SEC filings in 2013, Adobe had 11k employees. Last year, they reportedly had over 22k employees. Impressive growth, and around the same growth as Apple. And it seems like Adobe is not slowing down. Right now they have 1,464 open positions, up from 294 in mid December last year.

Current employees are also satisfied, the average employee rating is 4.4 (out of 5) which would mean a higher employee satisfaction than Oracle and Microsoft. Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen, is getting stellar reviews from the employees, 4.9 out of 5.

The stock might a bit expensive relative to competitors and current earnings, but based on the data, and with [ESG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE/sustainability/) Risk ratings being low and revenue almost doubling in the last four years, I think Adobe has a lot more room to grow and so I add the stock to my portfolio this morning.

Note: This is not financial advice. Do your own DD.

mb8wv8,grwm7nj,stocks,comment,1616485382,"Inflation doesn’t occur simultaneously and instantly. For example, every year, let’s say inflation is 2%. Apple is not raising its iPhone price 2% every year. Sometimes they raise by more, sometimes not at all. People expect the 2% inflation raise yearly. If all the sudden were on pace for 4%, but Apple has already released their phones and isn’t going to randomly raise prices mid cycle, they are now making 2% less than expected (4% actual minus 2% expected). 

In a nutshell, inflation causes the value of money to go down right? so when inflation occurs, if a company is bringing in the same nominal dollar amount but inflation is rising (and outpacing expectations that have been accounted for) the “real” or “true” revenue is less than expected. 

Inflation lowers future real earnings. 

To counter this, the fed raises interests rates, but doing so means it costs more money for companies to borrow money. For a tech company that may not be as profitable now but expects to be in the future so they rely on loans (think Uber, Doordash, lots of EV companies and SPACs), rising interests rates means needing to make more money to pay off debt. 

So inflation bad but so is the solution to inflation. 

To take advantage, a lot of people are rotating into value stocks (tech stocks are hit the hardest by inflation/raising interest rate) since these companies rely less on loans. Further consumer staples and retailers like Walmart etc continue to do well since interest rates rising isn’t that bad for them + inflation isn’t as much as a factor since they sell goods (like bread, eggs) that can fluctuate with the economy.

Personally, I think tech stocks will see a nice little run now that the fed has committed to not raising rates till 2023 and we’ve already had our big scare.

5. You dont have any control/visibility on dilution if company decides to raise cash from investors or offer equity to new employee.

There is no standard of reporting and “accredited investor” is a proxy for financial literacy. Projections can be extremely rosy and the assumption is you have the ability to dig into things enough to test their projections and push back. 

You’re going to need to understand exactly what you’re buying. Are you buying into a fund (partnership) that owns the company stock? If so, what are the costs, incentives and rights the GP have (could they keep the partnership open even if the stock goes public so you never actually get the shares)? If you’re getting shares directly, where do you sit in the cap structure? Employees are typically granted common stock but each VC round is typically a class of preferred equity that has a liquidation preference above each previous round and all are above the common. If things go well, all the preferred gets converted to common so you need to understand how the dilution works. If things don’t go well or even just ok. The VC firms could potentially sell the company for a value that leaves little to no value for the common equity. 

How do these platforms make their money? Is it a fee to broker the transaction or are they also making a spread (they bought the shares from the employees at $10 and you’re buying from them at $15)?

mbir72,,stocks,post,1616517403,"Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (TAST) 50% Upside Near-Term*This is not financial advice. I do not, nor does anyone I advise, currently hold any position in TAST though I may enter one in the near future.*

Summary:

Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST) is underpriced given industry tailwinds currently playing out and overhang from past underperformance. I believe there is 50% upside in the near-term to $10 per share based on a bottoms-up analysis of the company and industry.

Discussion:

Carrols is the largest Burger King franchisee with 1,009 units as of 12/31/20 and 65 Popeyes locations. COVID has bifurcated the restaurant industry with large, delivery optimized chains benefiting materially and small, undercapitalized chains fighting to survive. 

Carrols was a bit of an oddity when compared to the landscape of public restaurant peers through COVID. As one can imagine, sales shifted mostly to drive-through during the 2020 period, with 86% of sales being drive-through vs. 68% in 2019. Same-store-sales were down 2.8% during 2020, a less than stellar performance in a field of clear winners and losers. The decrease was the result of an uptick in average check and a decrease in customer traffic offsetting each other. Digital sales, however, jumps out as being the largest industry lagger. Only 3% of sales in 2020 were derived from digital, which includes delivery from third-party apps. The sales trend clearly points to Carrols benefiting in a post-COVID world rather than a delivery-centric COVID one. 

With this sales dichotomy in mind, I believe Carrols is well-positioned to take advantage of a US reopening with less restaurant competition as a result of COVID. Channel checks indicate that while January and February were strained – particularly February, given weather (TN, where 11% of TAST stores are located, was hit fairly hard)– March is setting a compelling pace. Based on this, I model 5% same-store-sales through 2021, trailing to 3% in 2022 and 2% for 2023 and beyond. I believe there is upside to these numbers given the roll-out of chicken sandwiches and the impact of the stimulus. 

This level of sales increase is meaningful as management has stated in the past that 45% of marginal dollars converts to EBITDA. However, given the timing of the large integration of the Cambridge acquisition in 2019, plus the new store openings and store closures, I believe the marginal profitability is now greater than before, giving upside to these profitability figures.

A point that almost always comes up when discussing profitability is the prospect of increased minimum wage. Management downplays this and often points to New York (12% of stores), where they operate in some locals at or near $15/hour with no change to labor percentage from elsewhere in the system. A recent pricing study out of Princeton on MCD corroborates this claim suggesting near full price pass-through to consumers when wages increase. While some point to possible technological automation to counteract wage inflation, I believe that is not a factor within the investment time-frame discussed here. As a result of these considerations, I model flat labor percentage, which I believe is likely conservative given the increase in labor efficiency from the average unit volumes I have also modeled. 

Another frequent case against the stock is that it is a value trap and that the CAPEX profile makes the free cash flow picture uncompelling. While remodels are certainly a seemingly suboptimal use of capital from a franchisor investor perspective, we’ve gotten quite a bit of clarity recently on long-term CAPEX guide from management, which allows us to back into some fairly robust assumptions. Further, the recently amended development agreement (ADA) with BK gives Carrols' management the ability to grow into strength but not the obligation to open as many stores, a positive in my view. The company gave up its right of first refusal to amend this, which I think was a worthwhile trade. 

Modeling out the ADA minimum store buildouts with some catch-up CAPEX from a suppressed 2020 CAPEX figure and historical averages on everything else gives a sustainable CAPEX figure not far off from the $60 million management guide for 2021. Given the operating modeling, which I believe is obtainable, this level of CAPEX creates an attractive free cash flow picture allowing for material deleveraging of their debt over the coming years, which has actually gotten fairly expensive, particularly on the B-1 term loan and the full revolver commitment fee, which successively steps up over the next few years. While I have modeled debt paydown with free cash flow, this capital could also be deployed to higher use cases.

All things considered, I am projecting $118 million in 2021 EBITDA, which includes stock-based compensation expense, as I view that as a real cost. At the historical average EV / adj. EBITDA multiple that is a $630 million equity value, and when taking into account the conversion of the preferred shares resulting in a 63 million count results in a $10 price target.

Note that the lack of near-term catalyst pre-May earnings could result in downside pressure on the stock in the coming weeks and months. Additionally, given management, Cambridge, and BKC hold nearly 50% of the stock on a fully diluted basis, the lack of float could deter some prospective investors.  

Upside Risks:

Upside risk to my projection is higher than expected unit volumes driving profitability and making new unit development more compelling. Additional new unit upside could be found with reduced retail rents post-covid reducing occupancy cost.

Additionally, management trying to buy down their multiple with additional franchise acquisitions within the Popeyes and BK systems (historically average 4x) could add value.

Downside Risks:

Unit volumes do not come back, resulting in operational underperformance. 

Wage inflation is unable to be passed through, resulting in decreased profitability.

Potential COGS inflation which cannot be passed through to customers

Restaurant remodels are significantly higher than modeled (both in frequency and cost), reducing free cash flow projection

Management tries to buy down their multiple but has difficulty integrating acquisitions","['BK', 'MCD']"

Well I’m in the red right now in just about every stock I picked, I’ve got a few good ones but many have dipped, some 20-30% since purchase. 

So my questions are, should I just continue to hold these? It’s only been a month.

I think if you bought these stocks for the long run, which to me it sounds you did, you shouldn't focus too much on short term movements, because in general: time in the market beats timing the market.

So a little background: I'm 29 years old and I just started investing some of my savings a few weeks ago. I opened an account with M1 Finance and created a pie. I will list below my holdings and I would love to hear some input from the community. My goal is of course to grow this as rapidly and steadily as possible. I wanted to see if you guys think it's better for me to ditch some of the companies so that I can increase my shares at others. This is nearly 50% of my savings just FYI. I have a bit in crypto and the rest in a bank account. I greatly appreciate any and all advice. Thanks so much!

I have deposited about **$20,000**.

**45% consists of 2% shares of 50 companies:** MMM, ABBV, AMD, APD, BABA, GOOGL, MO, AMZN, AXP, AAPL, T, BAC, BRK.B, BA, BMY, KO, DLR, DIS, ENB, XOM, FB, GM, GH, HON, INTC, IBM, JNJ, KHC, LMT, MA, MCD, MRK, MU, MSFT, NFLX, NSC, PEP, PM, PG, QCOM, RTX, SPYG, STAG, TSLA, USB, VLO, VZ, V, WPC, & WM

**5%:** VEA,

**5%:** VWO

As an added note, if I dropped some of the 50 companies and had more shares of the remainder, my dividends would go up correct? I like the idea of that, but I of course want to stick with a good balance between safety and growth. Keep in mind I've dived into the stock world less that a month ago, so my understanding of it is weak. A little more than half of the companies are just ones I know and trust and enjoy their products, while the rest are recommendations or found via research.

In addition to this portfolio I have a Roth IRA:

Thanks in advance!",
mbaidc,grwwasw,stocks,comment,1616495121,"Here’s a quick cursory overview of the basics to intermediate: 

Most important thing to learn from the start is that the foundation of Investing is not profits, it’s Risk Management. 

You need to learn to be able to keep it, before you can grow it. 

Also, assess your investment objectives (are you seeking safety, income, growth) or secondary objectives like (tax minimization or liquidity)?

Then pick your investment style: Value, Growth, combination of value and growth known as (GARP - Growth at a reasonable price), income or Momentum investing. 

Are you interested being a Passive investor (replicating the performance of an index) or Active investor (trying to outperform the market). 

Also understand different types of investments strategies: Dollar cost averaging, Dividends reinvestment plans, scaling in and scaling out, pyramiding etc.

With regards to psychology: learn about what’s known as “second-order thinking” and build a habit of thinking in probabilities. 

Remember 2 things: that inactivity in a stocks price is not a negative factor and the market rewards patience. 

Macro-economic factors: Ask yourself how the Political, Economical, and Social factors you learn and see will affect the Market, the economy, and more importantly, your investments. 

Learn about DCF models, they are excel models that calculate the intrinsic value of a stock in order to quickly asses wether they are overvalued, undervalued or fair valued by calculating the present value of a share price today relative to the amount of returns that it can potentially generate in the future. 

Fundamental and Technical analysis are not mutually exclusive as most think, you can apply them in unison to be a more effective investor or trader by using fundamentals to value stocks and using technical analysis to assess your entry and exit (buying and selling points). 

Learn about financial ratios to asses the overall financial health of the company (ex. Working Capital, Debt to equity, Gross profit margin, net profit margin, dividend yield, inventory turnover, EPS, P/E ratio. Etc.) - more useful for comparing companies position in the overall industry or sector. 

Diversification (Not putting all your eggs in one basket) by diversifying into different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s) or into different sectors and industries etc. and learn about negative asset correlation. 

Lastly, learn the inter-related relationship of how interest rates, inflation, stocks, bond-prices, currencies and commodities interact with each other and influence the overall state of the market, the economy and your investments. 

Depending on how much hours you generally put in a day on learning and research.. 

understanding and applying these concepts above should save you days if not weeks or even months of research and education. But never stop learning and you’ll become an even better investor/trader with experience. 

Hope this helps! :)

Also , there are plenty of studies that prove again and again that active traders rarely - if ever - beat the average S&P return / year.

Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

mashqk,,stocks,post,1616432653,"AT&T - Juiced the dividend this quarter by $0.3493Following advice on this forum I initiated a variation on the selling of covered calls on the AT&T stock I own to juice the income above what the stock earns in dividends.

&#x200B;

My strategy is when the AT&T dividends are paid into my account I buy more AT&T stock with the cash then sell covered calls against all my AT&T stock that expires the week before earnings.

&#x200B;

Doing this on 2/1 I was able to buy more AT&T shares at $28.79 and sell ""T Apr 16 2021 CALL 31.0"" for $0.49 which is near what the dividend is. If the stock would have been called at $31 I would have made $2.21 a share gain and pocketed the $0.49 for the call.

&#x200B;

As of today with the earnings call happening on 4/22, the dividend date announcement happening soon and the ex-dividend date in early April I decided to close my covered calls at $0.11.

&#x200B;

I netted $3423.56 in gains on the covered call options or $0.3493 per share.

&#x200B;

Adding the $0.52 dividend to the $0.3493 will give me 0.8693 of income for my 9800 shares of AT&T this quarter which is a 3% return or 12% annually.

&#x200B;

I plan to do this again at the beginning of May when the dividend is again paid.",

From Yahoo. March 2nd - Sweden-based Havre Global said Feb. 24 that it will list its stock. Investors waiting on the sidelines for further IPO details and confirmation of the true market size for milk substitutes may have had their questions answered.

Starbucks confirmed Monday that all of its stores nationwide will offer guests the option of adding Oatly's non-dairy milk substitute product as of Tuesday. The oat-based milk can be included in all of Starbucks' spring menu options.

Oatly's IPO details will likely be presented to the public in the coming weeks. The company could be seeking a $10-billion valuation in an eventual listing.
————————————————————————
Also:

 PRNewsWire included Oatly among its top oat milk brands, with other competitors in the market being Happy Planet Foods Inc., Danone (Silk), and Earth’s Own Food Company. In 2019, the global oat milk market size was $360.5 million. By 2027, that figure is projected to grow to $995.3 million. 

 One reason for oat milk’s increase in popularity is that it is often fortified with calcium and vitamin D, helping create a balanced diet for vegans and those with lactose intolerance. A greater acceptance of vegan lifestyles is also a factor. Oat-based dairy replacements have also grown in popularity because data suggest they have a lower environmental impact than some other plant-based milks, such as almond and cashew milk.",['SBUX']

mblide,,stocks,post,1616524761,"Metromile DiscussionLooking to have a bit of a discussion on the (relatively) newly public Metromile ($mile).

In summary, they are an insurance provider which offers pricing based on mileage. They position themselves as a disruptor in the space. People like to compare them with LMND, which frankly I disagree with wholeheartedly.

1) Their model has a market penetration weakness

Only in 8 states as of now, with aggressive forecasts aiming for nationwide by 2022/2023. This would require growth rates that the company has not yet hit or shown any reason for me to believe they can hit.

The main weakness: They require hardware installed into customers' vehicles to track mileage. This hardware drains the battery, albeit slightly. I see this come up as a large issue their customers have. Furthermore, long trips are effectively ruled out unless you want to switch providers or pay absurd premiums for that trip.

2) Competitors offer this pricing structure (Allstate). The main argument here is their entire differentiation tactic is imitable by formidable players. As it stands they don't have any sustainable competitive advantage based on pricing. Competing based on price with large players is a typically cutthroat and small market. Growth will be capped under this approach.

3) They have a large physical asset base. This is not like LMND or other agile competitors' business structures. They have a physical cost basis that exceeds that of a competitive online provider.

4) They license their software which they claim makes them competitive. Risk assessment and fraud detection are the primary use of this. I believe they license primarily to other insurance providers, something which I find goes against their growth strategy. Conflict of interest between revenue models.

5) Their growth has been largely fueled by stay-at-home orders and the shift to working from home. The reason they have experienced growth in 2020 is largely due to this. They were established in this space targeting low mileage customers which made them an easy choice for insurance switchers. I believe this ship has sailed and customers will either look to switch again or at least evaluate it.

6) Their valuation is largely based on their cash on hand (200-300M range). This was raised equity and is focused on paying down their debt. They are still not making money. They are all in on growth and if they can't meet targets, this company will be crushed.

tl;dr Company isn't making money, has existed for 10 years, and has likely seen the peak of their growth stimulated by the pandemic. They face monumental hurdles and have dominant competitors to stand up to.

Disclaimer: I am short shares of $mile.",
mblide,grylqg5,stocks,comment,1616525805,"Interesting play in this market, and I think your assessments are solid. One area that may hinder growth for this company (beyond what you have already pointed out) is the fear of tracking that may limit growth. There’s an entire subset of the population that is averse to having any kind of tracking devices in their possession. While this is only a subset, I think it’s reasonable to assume that some portion of the potential customer base will be driven off by this.

I’m also curious why they use physical tracking devices for the mileage instead of just having an app that is installed on users phones that will do this. The cost of software would potentially be a lot less expensive than using physical devices. Installation would be a non-issue for the most part as well.",

I’ve noticed twice recently that after I’ve sold some (but not all) shares of a company that my average buy in has changed.

I sold 170 shares of something just yesterday at €2.04 for a 1.4% loss, so my average buy in at was €2.08 or so.

Now today I still have 400 shares and it says my buy in is €1.85 and I’m 7% up overall. what??!

I averaged my way in i.e. so I bought chunks of shares at different prices, but I thought my costs should all just be averaged and when you sell some it should keep the same average? or is my broker for some reason selling the more expensive ones first??

The problem is that a ton of people are leveraged into speculative plays that are not profitable (which is why there is a bunch of negative sentiment). These companies have to borrow money in the debt market to continue operating - they do this through corporate bond offerings (or share dilution in the equity market), this comes with the promise that the company will pay their creditors back in a few years at a certain APR. If interest rates in the medium/long-term go up, then it becomes more difficult for these companies to grow, since they’ll have to pay more of their income in interest payments, rather than continued growth. They can avoid this by writing shorter dated bonds, but they’ll have to be able to repay the entirety of the loan sooner, rather than later, which has it’s own slew of issues.

The bond yields also affect a lot more than just what companies can borrow money it, it also affects - student loans, mortgages, savings accounts, margin loans, basically any loan you can get in the US.",

Price is effected by supply and demand which has to do with the price(yes, it is recursive). The options market and other factors can set the price but volume doesn't tell you that. It tells you how active the stock is being traded. A lot of vol means that the stock is trading hands a lot. It means a lot of winning and losing going on. (although one can win and then turn around and lose and be tied and it won't measure that)

When a stock as a lot of vol it means that a lot can happen. When there is no volume generally little can happen(such as pre market/after hours). Generally when there is volume it means one can make(or lose) money based money is flowing. When there is no volume one can't easily make money.",

mbfsip,,stocks,post,1616509325,"Thoughts on European telecom diversification plays VOD and DTEGYSo this is going to serve as a bit of DD and Discussion but I’m wanting to hear others opinions on these companies and hear what y’all’s outlooks are on them vs mine. 

So first up is Vodafone Group PLC (VOD); a company that pays semiannual dividends with a 5.7% yield, a current price around $18.65, a PT between $22.60-$25.48, an average PT of $24.04 and a P/B ratio of only .76. Looking at these numbers alone it seems like VOD is undervalued and when you look at their expansion into Africa and India as well as cementing their status as Europe’s discount cell service for all backpackers/tourists/Americans stationed overseas (they actually have contracts with the US military to sell their phones and chips directly to Americans on base in the military’s PX’s and BX’s)/students studying abroad you can see how qualitatively they also have a lot going for them. Personally I’m looking to begin dollar cost averaging in to VOD as I find both their yield and growth prospects attractive. Not to mention I used them while I was living in Germany and so did every single kid in my school. 

The second company I would like to discuss with y’all is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE) or for those of us in the states (DTEGY). DTEGY pays only a yearly dividend with a 3.47% yield and trades around $19.65 with a PT range between $15.53-$29.82, an average TP of $23.85 and a much more average P/B ratio of 2.16. While these numbers aren’t as great as VOD it is still the largest telecommunication provider in all of Europe, and also owns like 45% of T-mobile so they are getting a large amount of revenue from America’s 3rd largest cellular network. While I haven’t found anything on them expanding into emerging markets I have seen their recent huge investments into 5G and how they are making moves to solidify their 5G network to maintain their largest in Europe status. 

So do y’all have any thoughts on VOD and DTEGY? Personally I’m going to be buying a few shares of both and just watch how 5G continues to roll out. I also like them as they offer me some international exposure and diversification. Personally I hate AT&T due to dealing with them for years as a customer and as such don’t want to invest in them but still want some more communication sector diversification outside of VZ and DIS that still pays a decent dividend.

mbf90t,,stocks,post,1616507728,"Saia adds 20th facility in the NortheastLess-than-truckload carrier Saia Inc. (NASDAQ: SAIA) announced Monday the addition of another terminal in the northeastern U.S. The Johns Creek, Georgia-based carrier’s newly opened facility near Wilmington, Delaware, marks its 20th addition to the region in the last four years.

In 2017, Saia embarked on an aggressive Northeast growth campaign, adding terminals from New Hampshire to Maryland. Those plans accelerated following the demise of New England Motor Freight, which had a large terminal footprint in the area.

“The new facility in Wilmington enhances our service across this geography as well as throughout our network,” said Jared Mull, VP of operations for the East. “Beyond this new terminal, we plan to open an additional four to six facilities throughout the course of this year, including our Northeast Atlanta terminal targeted for the fourth quarter.”

On the company’s fourth-quarter call, management announced a $275 million net capital expenditures budget for 2021, which includes investments in its fleet, infrastructure and terminals. Saia spent $219 million in capex in 2020, a year that many companies cut investments and preserved liquidity due to uncertainty around COVID-19.

The carrier added one terminal and replaced five others in 2020, increasing total door count by 4%. Saia plans to eclipse that mark this year.

The step up in spending includes the purchase of raw land, greenfield developments and terminal expansions. Saia is aiming to expand capacity, improve its freight mix and reduce turn times by adding facilities that are closer to its customers.

“Despite the challenges that 2020 presented, we are continuing to execute our plans to grow and provide quality, industry-leading service for our customers,” added Mull.


Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) recently announced a hiring blitz for drivers and dockworkers following plans to expand its terminal network again this year. Yellow Corp. (NASDAQ: YELL) said it was adding 1,500 drivers and opening 12 driver academies in February. Last year, Forward Air (NASDAQ: FWRD) expanded its LTL offering to include a more traditional service outside of its legacy airport-to-airport terminals.

While LTL tonnage took a weather-related hit in February, analysts have become more bullish on the space in recent weeks as volumes have snapped back. Additionally, more of the industrial economy appears to be coming back online, historically a large contributor of LTL freight, and contractual price negotiations are yielding mid- to high-single-digit increases.

mayizi,,stocks,post,1616448682,"I think im experiencing FOMO. Can I get your guys' opinion on my thought process?Hi all!

I'm a 19 year old who has had his money in the market for around 2 years now.

Recently, as I've been finding out more and more about my passions, I've decided to major in an area in business, most likely finance or accounting. Because of this I've been learning more and more about investing and about the economy as a whole. I'm a big believer in the investing philosophies of people such as Munger, Buffet, and Lynch (but I'm also learning more about other famous investors).

One of the biggest lessons I've been discovering is that I don't know jack shit about investing and business. After reading Beating the Street by Peter Lynch, I've been thinking about my own investments and realized that I don't know near enough to support my individual stock purchases.

Last week, I made the decision to sell all my shares in all the companies I own, roughly 15,000$ on the basis that I need to learn much more before I can justify making intelligent stock purchases. I had shares in relatively riskier equities such as WFC, CCL, CHWY, and IPOE.

I think my decision to make that choice was a good idea, because the future of all these companies are pretty uncertain for one reason or another, and so I should be very well educated about the industries and business models of these companies to justify owning shares in them.

Another thing I've learned is that it's always better to invest than to let your cash sit around and do nothing. Therefore, I was considering the following investment strategy until I feel educated enough to make smart investments:

25-40% SPY

25-40% VOO

20%-50% 3-5 well known respectable blue chips stocks such as (JPM,COST,JNJ,DIS).

SPY and VOO are obviously extremely diversified and are great for less knowledgeable investors because they follow the market. Blue chip stocks are much less volatile that my previous holdings and many investors consider them safe but with positive future outlook.

Is this a decent idea? Or am I facing FOMO and wanting to have money invested to not miss out on a possible bull market in 2021? I've actually had great returns over the past year, but I know that it's easy to make money in a bull market. I don't want to be naïve and continue to invest without having strong reasoning or financial education.

I applied for margin privileges with TD Ameritrade today and was approved. My primary goal is not to use it, but have it available for writing spreads/PMCCs. All of my purchases have been in cash so far and my intent is to continue that going forward.

Now, a couple hours later I have a possible maintenance call warning on my account for being under my maintenance requirement. I called TD Ameritrade and the person I spoke with couldn't explain why purchases made with cash only had a margin maintenance requirement. In fact, that doesn't sound right at all and I've read the margin handbook through a dozen times now trying to figure this out.  I made a deposit just to make sure nothing bad happens, but I'm struggling to understand the mechanic here.

maqgm6,,stocks,post,1616427446,"The Telehealth Underdog: AMWL Announcing Q4 Earnings This WeekIt’s the season for Q4 earnings announcements. One that I haven’t heard much hype about yet is Amwell, which is weird to me because it’s one of the country’s largest telehealth companies. I’ve had my eye on AMWL since it’s IPO in September of 2020. The stock debuted at $18, where it issued 41.2 million shares and raised $742 million. It’s had a 52-week high of $43. So, like most stocks in recent weeks, it’s dipped a bit as COVID vaccines increase and the long-awaited stimulus checks hit our accounts. I don’t know about you guys, but *all* of my tickers have seen some hella red the last few weeks. Okay, maybe not GME and AMC… but that’s not what this post is about (for once). Most of us anticipate the market picking up, so here’s an overview of AMWL’s performance last quarter and what I’m expecting to see in Wednesday’s Q4 earnings call. 

AMWL’s first earnings announcement since going public came out last year in September. The company reported $62.6 million in revenue for the third quarter—an 80% increase year over year from $34.7 million. The pandemic driving millions of Americans to telehealth caused revenue to nearly double from 2019. Revenue directly from visits totalled $28.5 million, a nearly 300% increase from last year. Total visits also increased 455% from Q3 of 2019, coming in at more than 1.4 million. This is a decent chunk of the market considering the millions of Americans that have used telehealth in 2020. I know I have. Research shows that telehealth visits were up 154% the last week of March 2020 compared to the same period the previous year.

Now that the hard numbers are out of the way, here’s qualitative data that makes AMWL appealing. On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Keith Richards said he expected to see the upward trend continue for the healthcare company. This is due to a few things: A $100 million investment from Google, the expected continued use of telehealth after the pandemic ends and a plan to develop innovative technologies for the healthcare industry. Already, AMWL has launched new solutions to integrate in provider’s systems, making telehealth easier and more accessible. These include Amwell Now, Touchpoint Tablet software, and the C500 telemedicine cart. This could poise AMWL as a leader in the healthcare technology industry at the perfect time. 

So, what do the analysts think? Currently, analyst ratings show 4 buy and 7 hold. However, with AMWL hitting one of the lowest dips right now since its IPO, I’m thinking now is the best time to buy. I am in no way a financial analyst, but IMO, it can only go up from here. The stock price target shows a high of $45, median of $33, and low of $27, indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. At $20, this stock is an absolute steal. Let’s consider the potential growth here. With analysts predicting these numbers, even the median estimate represents a more than 60% increase from the current price of $20.15. At their high prediction of $45 a share, it would be more than a 120% growth in the next 12 months. Researchers say that the financial value of telemedicine visits is expected to reach $106 billion by 2023, with up to $250 billion of the current U.S. healthcare spending eventually shifting to virtual. This is why I’m talking about it, so why isn’t anyone else?

Earnings and sales forecasts predict $54.6M in sales and $-0.25 earnings per share. Now, should we be alarmed by this? Maybe in other industries, but telehealth as a whole has struggled to be profitable. Telehealth beast Teledoc hasn’t yet turned a profit either, with both companies posting a net loss in Q3 of 2020. I think this is the nature of the game. Telehealth is a relatively new and innovative industry, which sees the ups and downs anticipated from disruptive stocks. 

TLDR. Though the industry struggles to be profitable yet, telehealth is the way of the future. The pandemic may end soon, but this will not be the end of innovative healthcare technology that provides greater access to healthcare for millions of Americans. TDOC isn’t the only big player here. AMWL is the underdog we all need to be looking at before Q4 earnings are announced on Wednesday.",['UPS']

I have studies maths, but it really doesn't take more than basic 4th grade arithmetic to figure out that that is impossible:

To own 200 shares of 100 possible, there need to be 100 short sold ones. Whether those are naked ones, or rehypothecated ones, does not matter. The SI needs to be at least the institutional ownership over 100. No way around that.

maysyv,,stocks,post,1616449463,"(NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio DD(NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio Inc DD

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders.

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley. Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1. Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth.
2. Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin.

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue.

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR.

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to.

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded.

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million.

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season.

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

Id stay away from this one personally. Wine sales were up last year due to the pandemic, Id guess they will be flat or shrink slightly for the sector this year. Wineries reopening for tasting is not really a huge factor in overall profit or revenue. 

This is at a low multiple for a reason, where is the growth going to come from? Are they acquiring other vineyards? Buying other peoples grapes? If that's the case its more than likely just for the wholesale type wines with low margin.

maxpg1,,stocks,post,1616446430,"A Bull Case DD: $NGMS NeoGames the $DKNG of iLottery 

So I've been waiting to share this DD on $NGMS until it hit a 1B market cap. Which, it did so today.

First, I know iLottery feels like such a boomer idea, but let's face it. We've all bought a powerball, played mega millions, scratched some $2 stocking stuffers at Christmas, played a little Keno at the bar, etc. This industry is essentially what the online sport gambling industry was 2-3 years ago. In my opinion this stock could make me super rich. Why, because $NGMS is the pure play here!

**Who is NeoGames ($NGMS)?**

NeoGames is a technology-driven innovator and a global provider of iLottery solutions for national and state-regulated lotteries. Their full-service solution combines proprietary technology platforms with the experience and expertise required for successful iLottery operations.

**Some DD**

iLottery in 2020 was 2.7% of the total US lottery market. In 2 quarters, Va's iLottery went from 0% to 25%. Michigan's iLottery market share has grown to 40% of total lottery sales. In Europe, iLottery is 25-50+% of the total lottery market depending on the country. In 10 years, when the total U.S. lottery market is 120B, iLottery could be 50% assuming all states are online. $NGMS is in a joint venture with Pollard Banknote under the name of NPI (Pollard is a big player in the lottery printing business). NPI's cut of ilottery is 15%. Neo's cut is 7.5%. 7.5% of 60B is 4.5B. Profit margin is roughly 40%, or 1.8B and $70/sh. Put a 15X multiple on it, and you have a $1,000 stock. It currently trades at around $40/sh today at a 1B cap. And iLottery could reach 50% sooner than 10 years if Va's experience is any indication.

$NGMS is currently contracted with 50% of the states that allow iLottery; and has 70% of the market share (total $).

Just wait until CA, NY, FL, and TX join the party. NY just legalized online sports gambling, and unless they want to lose market share, they'll put the lottery online, too. Online sports gambling provides a MUCH lesser cut for the government. Lottery is a HUGE revenue driver for state governments, so they will not sit idle on iLottery for long once online sports gambling is legal.

Here is the kicker. $NGMS is also teasing getting into online sports gambling. My valuation on them is purely based on iLottery potential. If they were to get into sports gambling, look out... their technology is incredible and they could add a some serious disruption to that market as well. They are also an international business... I only included the upside from the US market alone. They have also gained contracts with entire European countries in recent weeks.

Do your own DD I am an idiot. Good Luck to all.",

mb3y4s,,stocks,post,1616464964,"Tesla (TSLA) could be worth $2.9 Trillion USD by 2025. The Next Tesla? At least $1.1 Trillion USD. (More DD Valuation Re. VOW and VWAGY)Today, ARK's Cathie Wood declared that Tesla could be worth $2.9 trillion USD by 2025, when setting a $3,000 price target.

What about the Next Tesla?

Thanks to guidance from Deutsche Bank, the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, should be worth at least $1.1 trillion USD, or over €0.9 trillion, by 2025.

[As of yesterday, Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should have been worth €181.2 billion.  Its consumer EV business proper should have been worth between €195.0 billion to €479.1 billion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ma2gyz/dd_valuation_of_the_next_tesla_grossly/)

So, how does the grossly undervalued Volkswagen get to €0.9 trillion by 2025?

The easier part is achieving and maintaining a valuation of €181.2 billion for its ICE and hybrid business.

As for the more ambitious part, management released this Investor Presentation:

[Leading the Transformation](https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/publications/presentations/2021/03/2021-03-16_Deep_Dive_Dahlheim.pdf)

Its 231,600 consumer EVs sold in 2020 constituted approximately 3% of its sales mix.  This achievement surpassed management estimates.

Next year, the company intends to increase this by at least two-fold, such that the sales mix is 6%.  Expect anywhere between 463,200 and 500,000 EVs.  [Deutsche Bank's conservative valuation of €195.0 billion for the consumer EV business today](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/) is surely based on lower numbers.

By 2025, the company intends to achieve a consumer EV sales mix of approximately 20%.  Expect approximately 1,544,000 EVs, or between 1.5 million and 1.6 million EVs.

Without taking into account inflation, consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €36.98 billion.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Even Deutsche Bank has conceded this distinguished multiple for the likes of Nio, despite that pure play EV maker having lower gross margin percentages than Tesla.  **Therefore, the consumer EV business should be worth at least €739.7 billion by 2025.**

All this is how the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, can reach a value of at least €920.9 billion, or over $1.1 trillion USD, by 2025.

mb0frc,,stocks,post,1616454165,"Score Media and Gaming: The Next Gambling Monster?To clarify this is my first DD, sorry if it looks messy and unformatted I am doing my best. I am bullish on the Score and hold 33 shares at a 32.59 CAD AVG. I intend on adding more once my swings either pay me out or inevitably hit my stop loss. I am not even remotely close to a financial advisor, I just started trading recently, so it is not a wise idea to buy or sell anything because of me.

Ticker:SCR

Marketcap:1.3bil USD

Shares outstanding:50 mil The Float:28mil

AVG Volume:330,000

All numbers from FINVIZ

CEO:John Levy 

Also the SCR just wen through an aggressive 10 to 1 r/S to get listed on the NASDAQ so institutional investors would take them seriously, which can explain why some of your charts may look funky. The r/S initially had the $SCR jump up to 54 CAD but then went down to like 26 CAD, now it seems to be consolidating in the low 30s.

The Bull Case

TheScore media is a Canadian based media company which is looking to get into the online gambling industry. The Score is the third biggest sports app in North America and biggest in Canada. The familiarity with the brand should be massive in Canada, and some experts have predicted Ontario itself to have 2-3 billion in annual revenue from sports betting (probably thanks to the Leafs sucking ass when it counts). Online gambling has been a craze with legalization becoming more imminent, and governments wanting to rake in that extra tax revenue.

Canada has just recently passed bill C-218, which aims to legalizes all single game sports betting. There is another reading tomorrow, where John Levy will be present to speak. Trudeau and his liberals also seems super pumped about passing this bill, as it can be a way to pay back CERB and other covid related debts.

PENN owns a 4.1% stake in the SCR and there have been buyout rumours from DKNG. Both want the brand that the Score owns. TheScore also has a partnership with PENN, where theScore bet app can be in states that PENN is in, as theScore is currently operating in Colorado, Iowa, Indiana and, New Jersey. As other states are set to legalize, theScore is hoping to get a piece of the American pie. Canada it will be much less complicated to operate.

PENN's market cap is 16.89 billion and Draftkings (DKNG) is 26.79 billion. Although I do not think $SCR will reach that anytime soon, it demonstrates the room for improvement.

SCR also just closed the 186 million IPO in the USA. They have lots of cash to throw at ads and others things a sports books will need.

They are also doing aggressive promos, like a $500 first bet risk-free. I have not used the app as I am Canadian and it is not available yet, but looking at videos and pictures, it looks clean. [https://www.thescore.bet](https://www.thescore.bet/)

Macquarie today initiated coverage on $SCR with an outperform rating and a $44 price target, and they are known for giving pretty conservative ratings. It is exciting that the score is getting the attention it deserves.

My PT is $70ish EOY and $150ish by 2025, but I also pulled these numbers out of my ass so don't base anything off of them.

BEARISH CASE

I am afraid of off-shore sports books already taking away a lot of the revenue of people who are already betting. Before I got into investing I used to bet with Betway and was confused why my money was being converted into pounds and it was always advertising soccer. I didn't realize what I was doing was illegal and many others don't. Also I don't think a ton of people would change apps unless the government tried to ban them or something. I am not very knowledgeable in the offshore sports books world.

Also DKNG and PENN are such monsters that they could just smother us with there promos and ads.

TLDR:$SCR is a media company which is turning to online gambling for sports. There is a lot of room for improvement. IANAFA. Do your own DD.

Any feedback on my first DD would be greatly appreciated. I know this isn't super complex with TA or financials, as I am still learning.",['NDAQ']

I usually do a livestream every Sunday and do the charting so people can watch and learn, but I couldn't do it yesterday. However, I had the Discord members send me their tickers so that I could chart them when I had time. Below is my technical analysis with targets for what they sent me.

\-Davin

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 6 // Targets Hit = 2 // Success Rate: 33%**

**$RIDE**\----No targets hit. Held the support we identified, but couldn’t fill the gap up to $18. Slowly bled off the rest of the week down to a low of $12.60

**$AQB**\----first target hit on Monday. It was $0.01 away from reaching our second target. Been choppy all week, but still holding above support line that it was resting on the prior Friday during AH

**$UBER**\----no targets hit. Highest it reached was $61.02 on Tuesday, but that was still $0.28 away from our first target. Fell all throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, stayed above 200 EMA on 4hr chart from Wednesday to Friday. Now back above 23.6% fib level so could be a potential play heading into this new week

**$AM**\----no targets hit. Uptrend support didn’t hold and slowly trended down throughout the week.

**$PLTR**\----no targets hit. First target was missed by $0.28 which was during premarket on Monday. PLTR took a doodoo throughout the rest of the week and hit a low of $23.39

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*** \- denotes the plays from the members that I really like and will be watching as well

**$FUBO:** seems to be holding support along the 61.8% fib level which is plotted as $29.55. If that holds and volume comes through we could see a gap fill up to $35.77. It’s holding support really well AND showing low volume the past two weeks, which is great to see if you’re wanting to go long because it shows strength even with decreased trading.

PT if $29.55 holds: $33 (conservative) > high $35’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*$SPCE:** Looking at the daily chart, I’m thinking it’ll fall down instead of head up, but we’ll have to see what happens during PM and Monday. If it can reclaim the downtrend resistance as support, then we can focus on the resistances as our targets. But, I’ll focus on the downside for now with how the chart is looking unless something shows me otherwise.

PT: $30 (low of prior trading day candles) > $28 (200 ema) > $24 (0% fib level from drawing on downtrend)

&#x200B;

**$TME:** Has earnings coming up later this morning, which is likely why it had a small run the past three trading days. Looks to have made new highs, so it’s a bit risky getting in now. I personally hate trading things when it’s at new highs until it starts consolidating and making new levels, but that’s not to say there’s no money to be made. I drew a fib extension to see what we’re dealing with and it looks like it already made it to the 100% extension level and is holding it as support on the 4hr. Hard to make a prediction where this could go ahead of earnings as I haven’t done any DD on the company, but I’ll give targets shown with the support/resistance levels below.

PT (upside): low $31’s > high $32’s

PT (downside): $30 > $29 > mid $28’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*NFLX:** Pretty much trading sideways the past two weeks. Hopefully that changes this week since the earnings report is coming up in about a month. Need to watch and wait to see if it breaks out of the consolidation it’s doing right now. More importantly, it needs to get above that $511 level and hold it as support to push up. If it fails that, we could see it drop towards the 200 EMA and uptrend support line, but I’m leaning more towards the upside due to earnings.

PT (upside): $516 > $530 > $542

&#x200B;

**\*\*$AMD:** Great looking chart as far as a buying opportunity goes. It’s near the key support level ($73.71) of the consolidation channel it’s been in since July of last year. Price is sitting on top of the 200 EMA on the daily chart as support, but if that gives we could see it falling to the uptrend support/key support in consolidation channel at what point I’d definitely want to take a position either shares or options a few weeks to a few months away.

PT (upside): high $81’s > high $84’s > $87 > $89

PT (downside): high $77’s > high $75’s > $74

&#x200B;

**\*\*$RBLX:** Bounced off the support at $67.17 and now trading real tight along the 200 EMA on the 4hr. Will need more trading time to see which way we’re heading because we’re also trading within a symmetrical triangle. Could break up towards resistance (which I’m leaning toward the most) or down towards support at which point I’d pay attention for a bounce.

PT (upside): $72 > $76

&#x200B;

**$AAPL:** Will be paying attention to this as we have a current call option in play, but looks to be heading up from support (both the uptrend and downtrend) which is great!

PT: mid $121’s > mid $122’s > $124 > $125

&#x200B;

**$SBBP:** Currently charting this as PM opened up and it took the hell off (LOL). If it holds this level at $4.63 we could see a gap fill to the high of PM of $5.46.

PT (upside): $5.46 > $6.33 > $6.82 > $7.00

Pro: poor situation in Europe will increase demand for the bonds, lowering yield

Con: removal of bank SLR rule will lower banks interest in purchasing bonds, lowering demand from banks, increasing yield

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on what will happen? Article from the street:

&#x200B;

U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower Monday, providing early support for tech stocks that could extend throughout the week as the government looks to unload nearly $330 billion in new debt onto a cautious and unsteady bond market.

&#x200B;

Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the country's central bank chief, Naci Agba, over the weekend, just days after he had approved an 200 basis point interest rate hike designed to blunt the impact of inflation in the struggling economy. 

&#x200B;

""The new political interference from Erdogan, who has long railed against hiking interest rates because he thinks they cause inflation, send the lira into a tailspin on fears that international investors will pull their money from the country on concerns of new rate cuts the would undermine the orthodox “'bitter medicine' of further interest rate hikes to stabilize and strengthen the currency,"" said Saxo Bank strategists. ""The country is already low on reserves and could, in extremis have to implement capital controls if capital flight, whether domestic or foreign, becomes a deepening problem.""

&#x200B;

The move sent the Turkish lira down 15% against the U.S. dollar, the steepest decline in nearly three years, and triggered a rush to safe-have assets in Europe and elsewhere, including U.S. Treasury bonds, with benchmark 10-year notes falling to 1.68% from the 1.75% peak, the highest since January 2020, they reached during the height of last -week's sell off.

&#x200B;

Ironically, much of what Governor Agba said with respect to rate hikes -- which he linked to shift in global investor appetite, loose central bank policies around the world, rising commodity prices and near-term inflation risks -- are concerns that have triggered the longest rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields in eight years and corresponding pullback in tech and growth stocks.

&#x200B;

Further upward pressure followed last week when the Federal Reserve, fresh off its March policy meeting that pledge to keep rates at record lows for at least the next two years -- even as the economy looks set to grow at its fastest pace since 1984 -- ended a capital break for domestic banks that could lead to further Treasury bond sales, and thus higher yields, in the months ahead.

&#x200B;

Normally, that would have investors exceedingly nervous heading into a hectic week of bond auctions, which includes a $60 billion sale of benchmark 2-year notes on Tuesday and another $62 billion in 7-year notes on Thursday, as inflation signals hot up and deficit hawks renew their criticisms of the Biden Administration's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Act.

&#x200B;

Turkey's brewing currency crisis, however, alongside the sputtering vaccine rollout efforts in Europe that are likely to delay the region's post-pandemic re-opening, are likely to boost demand from international investors for the U.S. assets on sale this week, keeping prices high and borrowing costs low.

&#x200B;

A $38 billion sale of benchmark 10-year notes earlier this month, in fact, drew solid international demand, with foreign investors taking up 57% of the overall total. 

&#x200B;

That said, analysts at JPMorgan caution that the Fed's removal of the SLR benefit, just as primary dealers are likely needed to take-up a greater share of the $209 billion in coupon paper on sale this week, could lead to another leg higher in Treasury yields -- and corresponding pressures on U.S. stocks -- in the days ahead.

&#x200B;

""While valuations are supportive of increased demand from foreign investors ... foreign demand alone is unlikely to stabilize Treasury yields,"" JPMorgan said. ""Moreover, over the very near term, liquidity conditions lend upside risk to yields ahead of (this) week’s supply process.""",['LEG']

That was around September. I'm sitting at $325 now, so I feel like for being a noob with no idea what I'm doing that I have been doing pretty okay so far. I've just been running off what seems like common sense so far, but I want to actually know what I am doing a little better.

It's rough though. I don't want to trust major websites because they lie about so much else. I've started lurking some of the stock related subs here, but everything is so loaded with jargon no one explains that it feels like I'm trying to read a foreign language. Even the rare 'beginners' post I manage to come across every blue moon is nigh incomprehensible.

I don't want to invest any more than I have in stocks now until I'm more knowledgeable. The initial $200 was a crazy whim that's been working so far, but a gamble is a gamble and you don't play big if you don't know the strategies inside and out. At this point even a general overview of those is an improvement over the common sense ""sell high, buy low, diversify"" I came in with.

maix3m,,stocks,post,1616403548,"Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto Hire Investment Advisors For Hong Kong IPORoughly two weeks after a Reuters report broke out speculation regarding Hong Kong IPO plans of the Chinese EV trio NIO Limited (NYSE: NIO), XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI), more details have emerged.

What Happened: Nio is availing the services of Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley for assisting with its Hong Kong listing, an IFR report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Nio is reportedly looking to offload a 5% stake, valued at around $3.4 billion, in a secondary listing.

The valuation is calculated based on Friday's closing price of Nio's ADS listed on the NYSE.

The report further said Xpeng has hired Bank of America and JPMorgan and Li Auto is working with Goldman Sachs and UBS, for their respective Hong Kong listings.

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at it's current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Furthermore, it's short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

^(7) [^(https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)](https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering it's growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

&#x200B;

>Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%.

Some quick questions:

1. Why did their COS & SG&A rise 22% QoQ into Q4 2020, but operating income only rose 18%?
2. What's the $313 million in goodwill on their balance sheet?
3. Why do they suddenly have $121 million in accrued expenses? What are they for? Where are they deferred to?
4. Why did working capital increase for two quarters straight?  Is their supply chain efficiency weakening?

These things may or may not be problems but they have to be picked apart in good DD.  It took less than two minutes looking through their financials to spot them, but there's no commentary in your DD on those or other material changes to their Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

What concerns me is there's not enough scrutiny of their financials but a lot of regurgitation of company earnings call talking points which makes your post read less like due diligence and more like an advertisement.",

mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. 

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. 

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud** 

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! 

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. 

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. 

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. 

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions. 

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. 

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. 

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['JPM', 'ADI']"

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I'd take this over a savings accnt anyday.

mb7dzn,grwejpc,investing,comment,1616478641,"LMT is about 10% of my portfolio and I have high hope for it, but there's really no guaranteed easy money. I initially bought at 370 and keep buying more and more on its way down to 320s, so now I just broke even.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['NDAQ', 'HD']"

There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['UNP', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'KSU']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

Not that it would get you your money back if you did track them down.

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

I've seen a few posts now from Bloomstran about TSLA, while I'm not an advocate of the stock and don't hold any myself and he has a small short position in it, sounds like he has some personal vendetta against it and sounds like he's just salty... Everyone is free to have their opinions and well articulated short reports add value but if he's so confident he should just increase his short position rather than write up junky comments, just rubs me the wrong way.   


Maybe he should take some advice from one of the men he follows so religiously:

“My thoughts are two,” Munger, who serves as the Journal’s chairman replied. “I would never buy \[Tesla\], and I would never sell it short,” he said, referring to a technique investors use to bet that a stock will decline.

And “I have a third comment,” the billionaire investor continued: “Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. I think Elon Musk is peculiar and he may overestimate himself, but he may not be wrong all the time.”","['UPS', 'TSLA']"

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BNGO/earnings/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BNGO/earnings/)

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Latests news:**

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

ma29dn,grsamuq,investing,comment,1616394655,"Perhaps my story can be instructive. I am 55 years old. I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

Is it possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify incorrectly priced stocks? Sure, if they have non-public information about that company.

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above.",

That'll happen when you compare a global fund vs a US only fund and focus only on the US part of the US/ex-US cycle. I can almost certainly point to times where VTI would have been worse than IWDA.

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

m9i525,,investing,post,1616280238,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

Furthermore, taking a quick glance at their financial statements, marketing is by far the largest expense item on their P&L. A potential green flag is their marketing expenses are much lower for the T9Ms in FY20 vs FY19. But, has Management indicated they are going to cut back on that spending and think they are starting to get some stickiness in their user base?

Most Poshmark sellers sell their product through other marketplaces as well (ebay, mercari, grailed), that offer less fees for both seller and buyer.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0.

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity.

However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

m8o362,,investing,post,1616179606,"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )  

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m8o362,grjfujb,investing,comment,1616198653,"I live in Colombia and there are some key points worth knowing before entering this move:

1. **The regulation is volatile.** The government party does not support completely medicinal cannabis. President only supported it with the condition on being more strict on licenses (benefiting big producers as Clever) because his hated predecesor had a more progressive agenda on cannabis. Two years ago there were rumors about an official request looking for a reduction in our global quota. Never happened.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['UPS', 'PGR']"
m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

Second, CPI is forecast to hit 3% in May and will be companied by real economic growth as we climb out of the massive hole that was 2020. In short, the next few months will be market euphoria with the media will stirring up inflation fears and reports that government spending has gone too far.

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers.

I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know.

They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months.

Cineworld Group own cinemas across both North America and Europe. Around 2017/2018 Cineworld Group aggressively expanded and bought over competitors in North America with this expansion making it the second-largest cinema chain in the world. The expansion, combined with COVID, however, has left the company with significant debt and close to bankruptcy. That said, with cinemas reopening, and them receiving some bailouts, they now have a chance to avoid this.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

For those who are interested in ethical investing Brewdog is a certified [B-Corp](https://www.brewdog.com/bcorp) and has a growing focus on sustainable production and distribution. As part of their sustainability commitment, [all their recipes are publically available.](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/community/diy-dog)

m8ugyr,grmpuy8,investing,comment,1616274792,"I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

Disclaimer: Games Workshop has been my biggest holding for almost 2 years now, since i started investing.",['IP']
m8ugyr,grlkrn9,investing,comment,1616255601,"Interesting, love the outside the box picks.

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

It also appears they may not be able to meet upcoming long term debt covenants. It requires Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of below 5.5x by June. To me, they’re not going to meet this.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway. 

I don’t think theatres will be able to operate back at normal capacity for years with the move to streaming platforms and lack of big blockbuster productions during the pandemic year. It’ll be a steep uphill climb ... or a drop off the cliff.",

&#x200B;

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance. This ruling may have a significant impact on funds and investments classified under ESG and socially responsible investing.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Were participants in these retirement plans not given the option to opt out of ESG investing? or are they now not being given the option to opt in?

Or has this regulation since been removed? Will it be?",

I think that they had a legitimate point that the claims made by some of the funds are not clear and/or hard to validate. However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

Right now is a good opportunity to look at the EV and Microgrid sector with some detailed research and decide if investing in this field should fit your portfolio for a long hold. Clean energy is supported at a level it finally deserves with the current U.S. Government Administration. The recent sell-off in clean energy was a needed correction, but companies like Novonix will be severely undervalued soon in being that they are working to support the growing demand for Lithium-ion technology and the resources to support it. China is major competition, but either way you look at it, they may not have enough resources to support their own transition to EV and Microgrid clean energy within the next few years.

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too.

I have a pretty high risk tolerance due to time but would ideally prefer to have some ‘safe’ investments to balance it out [currently thinking to buy some index ETFS?], and I have no current holdings or debt.

Up until now I've only invested in stocks and mutual funds so when it comes to investing in privately-held companies what pitfalls and financial key metrics should I look at / ask them?

The company today:

* Current outstanding shares: 6m
* Implied equity value: 23m USD

They are about to initiate another round of funding, this will be a large round where they are trying to raise 440m USD since they are scaling up substatntionally from local to national distribution and sales in order to supply demand , if sucessfull it will change the numbers to:

* Outstanding shares: 15.5m
* Estimated valuation: 440m USD

Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between [Visa](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE) and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?   


Supporting this idea, [Apple](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ) is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, [Facebook](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FB:NASDAQ?window=1Y) is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak.   


What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech? Will small and medium Tech and Financial stocks see any boost relative to those with massive market capitalization? Or is this all not having much of a market impact at all, and we'll see even Visa's and Apple's stocks jump back up later in the year?","['FB', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ', 'SPGI']"

But what people forget is you also don’t want to buy long-duration equities,” Bernstein, CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC’s “[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/)” on Wednesday. “What’s a long-duration equity? Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

Greetings

**The narrative**

1. Chinese   energy production by source: Coal 58% Petro 20% Hydro 8% LNG 8%   Renewable 5%  Nuclear 2%. Renewables have had an amazing 10 years with   explosive growth, Liquids and Nuclear growth is more modest but Nuclear   curve is steeper. The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)
2. Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal. "" full  article [here](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210312A0AAON00)
2. The  stock is slightly overvalued and I have a hard time comparing it to  other stocks or indexes. (data source yahoo finance)Trailing P/E 	16.15   Price/Sales (ttm)	1.94  Price/Book (mrq)	1.46  Enterprise Value/Revenue  7.28  Enterprise Value/EBITDA  11.38

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?  


My  background: New to the channel and to reddit, I was brought here by  crypto.I  am looking into subject company, considering that the net-0  emissions  targets are only possible by nuclear energy. I have always  admired the clean and cheap features of nuclear energy, I always  supported it and I anticipate it's golden era.Now, on investing, I would  like your take on  this company, and to initiate discussions which will  circle knowledge  through.Bear in mind that there are some restrictions  to investing in  this company if you are an American at the time of  writing.Last, I  want to avoid the trap of replicating the returns i got  from crypto. My  thinking is long term >5 years and I give weight  both on the  narrative and on fundamentals.",

**2. The Dow has compounded at less than 3 basis points a day since 1970. Since then it’s up more than 3,000%.**

**3. The Dow has only been positive 52% of all days. The average daily return is 0.73% when it’s up and -0.76% when it’s down.**

**4. The Dow has spent more time 40% or more below the highs than within 2% of the highs (20.6% of days vs. 18.4% of days)**  
*No pain, no gain.*

**5. The Dow gained 38 points in the 1970s**  
*See above.*

**6. Why am I using the Dow instead of the S&P 500? They’re effectively the same thing. The rolling one-year correlation since 1970 is .95.**  
*Stop wasting your time on this.*

**7. At the low in 2009, U.S. stocks were back to where they were in 1996.**  
*Stocks for the long-run. The very long-run. Usually. Sometimes.*

**8. At the low in 2009, Japanese stocks were back to where they were in 1980.**

**9. U.S. one-month Treasury bills went 68 years with a negative real return.**  
*What’s safe in the short-run can be risky in the long-run.*

**10. At the bottom in 2009, long-term U.S. government bonds outperformed the stock market over the previous 40 years**  
*Stocks generally outperform bonds, but there are no guarantees.*

**11. Gold and the Dow were both 800 in 1980. Today Gold is $1,700/ounce. The Dow is near 32k.**  
*Cash flows > commodities.*

**12. Over the last twenty years, Gold is up 340%. Stocks are up 208%, with dividends.**  
*You can support any argument by changing the start and end dates.*

**13. Since 1980, Gold is up 153%. Inflation is up 230%.**

**14.** [**CTAs**](https://portal.barclayhedge.com/cgi-bin/indices/displayCtaIndex.cgi?indexCat=Barclay-CTA-Indices&indexName=Barclay-CTA-Index) **gained 14% in 2008 when stocks lost 37%. Since 2009 they’re up 2.5%. Stocks are up 282%.**  
*Non-correlation cuts both ways.*

**15. If you had invested from 1960-1980 and beaten the market by 5% each year, you would have made less money than if you had invested from 1980-2000 and underperformed the market by 5% a year**

*The stock market ≠ the economy.*

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much, it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grd5s0u,investing,comment,1616078801,Incredible.  I already posted this below your original post: it reads like the script for a Netflix docuseries.,['NFLX']
m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat. 

Looking forward to seeing the stock price go to less than a $1.",['TWTR']

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['PYPL', 'ETSY', 'AMZN', 'EBAY']"

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['FB', 'AMZN', 'EBAY']"

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

m71yzd,,investing,post,1615992262,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

With the massive influx of people into ""reddit investing"" I assume a significant percentage to be novice (I'm trying to keep it polite). 

That being said, the less sophisticated the  investor, the more likely they would be to act ""later"" and with less regard to risk and volatility. And yet I believed they WOULD act. 

I really feel as if the last 2 months has created a FOMO phenomenon and that there is significant, traditionally irrational buying. 

I just could not figure out a way to quantify and then be able to act on it. 

You've taken my simple idea and added a brain to it.

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings.

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['PWR', 'ED']"
m6w7uv,,investing,post,1615972004,"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.As I see it:

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

In the current environment, with so much liquidity pouring into the markets, sure, inflation is a great concern.

1. In the last 6 months, their webpage traffic has almost doubled. From 22M in September to 36M in February. More visitors to their webpage tells me that more people are interested in their products.
2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter","['GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'NDAQ', 'SBUX']"

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['PGR', 'GPS']"

Efficiency also isn't a binary, it exists within gradients in all markets - so something like large cap stock is far more efficient than junk debt, but both are less efficient than treasuries.  Still the idea that efficiency is a perfect condition that exists magically simply isn't a reality.

2) if EMH were accepted as some sort of holy truth then a poorly written blog post citing trades would not constitute strong evidence.

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.

m6zzhm,,investing,post,1615986444,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['QCOM', 'ARKK', 'NVDA', 'TER', 'BA', 'IBM', 'MMM', 'INTC', 'TXN']"

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

Good luck out there, be careful, and have fun.",['AAPL']

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

m6w42x,gr7ymhr,investing,comment,1615973992,"Need some advice here.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

Amazon is Jeff’s flywheel. More customers = more revenue to invest in CapEx = more capabilities/lower prices = more customers. There’s a massive CapEx moat if you want to enter the logistics or data center business.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM.

m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.

m6lakz,,investing,post,1615933928,"Plug power - unravelling the jargonI do love having a go at deciphering the management bullsh8t when they have dodgy accounts (sorry if you own it). Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.


Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

m69ifj,,investing,post,1615902668,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['BLK', 'UPS', 'NDAQ']"

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

**[Recent 1Q21 Earnings](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/) - 02/03/21**

* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.

Marketing the way Scott’s does won’t work the same way and it may actually form part of the regulations that come out on legalization.

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

Q4 earnings miss GAAP EPS off by 7.7%.  FCF analysis puts fair value at $134.  DCF EPS even lower.

It doesn't matter that they had a strong quarter.  What matters is that they set an expectation with investors and missed it by almost 8% or 11.7 cents per share (~$311 million total) in a year where they had been beating earnings by double digit percentages and hadn't had an EPS miss since Q4 2020.  Prices were moving on that expectation and when it failed to materialize, investors penalized WMT.

This continues to further Graham and Buffett's view that stocks trading in excess of their fair value are more susceptible to downward pressure particularly when the market is pricing in earnings that don't materialize as expected.   It should be noted that Buffett doesn't ""buy the ... dip"".... He looks for securities that are trading well below their fair value, typically 30 to 50% below fair value rather than right on the cusp of it, regardless of price movements in relation to near-term highs.",['WMT']

m60b98,,investing,post,1615866531,"I have to be missing something about the EV spaceI have been in the markets since college, about 6 years ago. I am not an expert and have my fair share of misses. This isnt a typical ""doomsday"" post. In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players.","['ICE', 'GM', 'TSLA']"

m60b98,gr3r6j2,investing,comment,1615884824,"This was an honest question, and I will do my best at giving an honest, non-hype no BS answer as good practice to articulate my thoughts on the space. (*Disclaimer:* I could be defined as a mega-bull on the what I'll call broadly the 'electrification' opportunity that faces the world in the 1-2 coming **decades,** EVs being a big part of that). I'll start with my thoughts and then answer your questions. I also work in the space, and have been following it as an energy nerd for...a long time).

I would say **I am very concerned** about the 'EV froth' right now. With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

&#x200B;

I know its been long, but I hope it was worthy of the read. I can always write and share more if there are specific questions.

Edit: And answering your high level question about what you are missing, its that in my view and what I've seen, TSLA has been the one that has derisked a lot of the market and made the manufacturing progress (turning clearly cash flow positive forward looking as of January 2020....hmm) where they have crossed the chasm and are now on, a product manufacturing driven rocket ship. These other companies and the space have enjoyed the rising tides, hype, capital, and knowledge that it is possible. Then comes, the greed, the frauds, the bubble, and the damage. When the tide goes out, who will have no clothes? That is the core of what I think you might be missing about the space.","['ICE', 'TSLA']"

you buy 100 shares at $10 with 10% dividend and market cap of 10 thousand( and the outstanding shares are 1000) that means 

the dividend is is $1 per share with it you can buy 10 shares

if the price goes up to  $20 what would change?

well the market cap would change to 20 thousand but the outstanding shares stayed the same :(

but your dividend percentage would also change :( to 5%

so your dividend would be the (market cap \* the percentage) / the number of shares 1000) \* the amount of shares you own would be still be $100  woot same money!

but your purchasing power went down so now you can only buy 5 shares.",
m6iaod,gr5wuro,investing,comment,1615927239,"

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",
m6iaod,gr68t4c,investing,comment,1615932838,"The company decides what to do with their budget.   

Some spend all their money (wisely or not).  The goal is to grow the business,  build another factory, or buy more trucks or whatever.   Sometimes that means buy a smaller company.   If they grow wisely,  the value of the stock goes up.

Some try to grow, but slowly,  maybe there aren't any good opportunities at the time so they could buy back their stock with the extra cash.  This makes the value of the stock go up. 

Some return the money to the shareholders as dividends. 

You can find different combinations of these.  Some growing companies may periodically pay a one off special dividend. Others pay a small but routine dividend, and grow or buy back shares depending on opportunities.   Others just keep stable and pay most of the profits as dividends, and as the years roll on with inflation they will try to raise the dividend every year. 

Each of the attract different types of investors so they try to stick with a strategy. For example, retired people like to count on dividends as income so you see utilities finance growth with bonds and maintain the dividend because if they cut the dividend those people would all sell.  Cyclical companies pay dividends in good times and cut it in down cycles.",

**Introduction** 

During a casual scroll through the dregs of Robinhood, I stumbled upon a listing that caught my eye: Future Fintech ($FTFT), a China-based “blockchain e-commerce financial technology company” that’s up an impressive 455% over the past year. Featuring a market cap of \~$500m and share price of \~$5.50 (at the time of discovery), it appeared at first glance to be a player in a hot sector with plenty of room to run. I decided to do a deep-dive into their history, products, and SEC filings as an exercise in due diligence.  

What I found was bewildering – and a great lesson in why doing your own thorough research before investing is vital. Let’s take a look at what I found. 

**A Brief Company History** 

$FTFT wasn’t always a pioneer in one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. Before pivoting to blockchain, e-commerce and crypto in 2018, $FTFT produced and sold fruit juice - yes, seriously - as SkyPeople Foods Holding Ltd. (“SkyPeople”). The carcass of the company dates all the way back to 1998, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on their recent history. 

SkyPeople was brought onto the NASDAQ via secondary offering through underwriters Rodman & Renshaw (featured in the documentary *The China Hustle*), who have a history of bringing sketchy Chinese microcap companies to market and [violating Finra rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/finra-fines-rodman-renshaw-for-analysts-actions.html). Interestingly, SkyPeople settled a [$2.2m class action lawsuit](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf) (.pdf link) in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1,000%** and failing to disclose a **related-party transaction** involving their former CFO, Yongke Xue (now board chairman), to shareholders. 

According to their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm), the transition to their latest business focus hasn’t been going so well: “The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised **substantial doubts about its ability to continue** as a going concern” (pg. 7). As of September 30, 2020, positive operating cashflows were predominantly related to stock compensation and discontinued operations – not their stated core business (pg. 3). The quick ratio for their 3Q2020 financials (0.057) indicates that the company doesn’t have adequate liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities. 

  
Compounding their troubles is a **subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement** issued on February 21, 2020, addressing their accounting practices, management oversight, and the sale of one of their subsidiaries (pg. 16). Note that this critical piece of information is missing from their website’s [news page](http://ftft.top/en/news.html). 

Their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm) \- the last one filed with the SEC - details their routine, schizophrenic changes in name and business focus since 1998, as well as their suspiciously complicated and web-like organizational structure, portrayed on a [chart](https://imgur.com/PNFqHLj) (pg. 4) featuring font so small that it’s impossible to read.  

In addition to being an industry leader in juice production and blockchain technology, $FTFT is also an innovator in taking out loans, leases, and service contracts, defaulting on them, and getting slapped with judgements in court, boasting an impressive record of [**20 defaults and lawsuits**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006) in six years (2014-2019, pgs. 42-45).  Furthermore, they’ve regularly been in danger of being delisted by NASDAQ due to their **persistent failure to file reports on time** (pg. 40). 

Now that we’ve scratched the surface of this industry heavyweight’s complex history, let’s examine $FTFT’s products and services. 

**Blockchain, E-Commerce, and Crypto – Oh My!** 

According to $FTFT’s website, [www.ftft.top](http://www.ftft.top/), their core revenue generators revolve around blockchain-enabled e-commerce. We’ll take a brief, critical look at each of them below. 

**“Chain Cloud Mall”,** AKA “GK Shared Mall” ([www.gksharedmall.com](http://www.gksharedmall.com/)), is described on their website as an “...innovative B2B2C e-commerce platform created by well-known investment bankers, e-commerce and blockchain technology industry elites, financial technology experts, and sharing economy scholars."" In reality, it appears to be a standard, boring retail platform, absent of any evidence whatsoever that blockchain & fintech “experts” and “scholars” were involved in its creation, or that blockchain technology is even in place at all. It’s replete with dead links and has seemingly little engagement. In fact, according to their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm), it generated an abysmal **$0.54m** in revenue from a total of **6,401 users**. 

**“NONOGIRL”** is a “cross-border e-commerce platform” that, in reality, appears to be a standard-web auction site that was seemingly [abandoned 7 months ago](https://imgur.com/aH4B94h) according to the NONOGIRL LinkedIn page. It’s unclear if the site was ever launched; searches on [www.baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com/) and the Google Play Store return no direct results to the platform. 

**“DCON”** is a “blockchain-based application incubator and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets” that appears to be dead in the water, as [the associated coin never appears to have been released](https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R). No development updates are available on $FTFT’s website for either the “incubator” project or the DCON platform itself. 

**Conclusion** 

All publicly available evidence points toward this name being an incredibly risky investment with a hefty amount of downside looming overhead. Major red flags abound – and to those holding long positions in this company: **invest with caution**.

All SEC filings can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/ciks=0001066923&entityName=Future%2520FinTech%2520Group%2520Inc.%2520(FTFT)%2520(CIK%25200001066923)). Thanks for reading.","['GOOGL', 'PG', 'NDAQ', 'PM']"

m5kkxa,,investing,post,1615814594,"Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

It sounds like some big companies (Amazon and Epic games are mentioned as potential bidders as well) are interested in capitalizing on discord's future.

I use discord and run a community and am also a subscriber for the past few years. If they go public I am definitely in. While they are firmly established as a place for people to socialize while playing video games, they've got their eye on expanding beyond the video game sphere.

I use slack for work but discord is superior as a collaborative tool. That's probably where Microsoft sees value. They can also provide discord as part of Windows. I think this can be good for both assuming Microsoft continues its trend toward becoming a more open platform than it's been in the past.

Because discord is also still firmly grounded in video game culture, there's overlap with Microsoft's Xbox and PC gaming I'm general. It's hard to imagine more value being provided by the other bidders in this situation. Still, Discord also has done very well on its own and the size of this bid suggests it would thrive even without being purchased. I'd bet that if they went public, Microsoft would buy up a lot of shares. Their futures are intertwined.","['AMZN', 'MSFT']"

I'd say sell before earning since the earning are expected & the last two the stock fell nearly 20% moments after the missed earnings were released.

Great company in terms of balance sheet but I think people are worried that the main source of revenue is covid tests, obviously testing will still be around for a long time but I'm sure it will drop significantly over the coming years.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-23.html)

*****

> # 1. S&P 500 set to drop on anniversary of stock bull market

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 broke two-session losing streaks. The Nasdaq logged a second straight session of gains, recovering about half of Thursday’s 3% decline. Tech stocks benefited over the past two sessions from the 10-year Treasury yield retreating from last week’s 14-month high. Tuesday marks one year since the Covid low in the stock market, which ended the fastest bear market ever and ushered in another bull market. The S&P 500 has gained 76% since the March 23, 2020 close of 2,237. Over the past year, two presidents, Congress and the Federal Reserve put extraordinary fiscal and monetary policies in place to support the economy during the pandemic.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell to testify on Capitol Hill on economic recovery

> * Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testify Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee on the economy at 12 p.m. ET. Yellen, who was Powell’s predecessor, said she sees both growth and possibly full employment next year. She credits President Joe Biden’s Covid relief package. For his part, Powell’s prepared remarks struck a cautiously optimism tone, saying the economy is “much improved” but the recovery is “far from complete.” Last week, after its March meeting, the Fed forecasted higher growth and inflation, while saying interest rates will likely remain near zero through 2023.

*****

> # 3. U.S. officials: AstraZeneca may have included outdated data

> * An independent group of U.S. health advisors said Tuesday that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in its Covid vaccine trial results. The questions came one day after the U.K. drug maker said a late-stage trial in U.S. and in Latin America showed 79% efficacy for its two-shot regimen. The Data Safety Monitoring Board expressed concern about whether the material provided by AstraZeneca created an “incomplete view of the efficacy data.” AstraZeneca, which said Monday it planned to file for FDA emergency use authorization next month, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

*****

> # 4. Covid cases rise in parts of U.S. as some states relax restrictions

> * New Covid cases are once again on the rise across more than half of the U.S., as health officials warn about reopening too soon and race to vaccinate more people before highly contagious strains become prevalent in the country. As of Sunday, the seven-day average of new cases rose by 5% or more in 27 states, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Across the U.S., the nation logged an average of 54,308 new cases per day over the past week, a 1% rise from the prior week after months of rapidly declining case numbers.

*****

> # 5. Biden considers $3 trillion package for infrastructure

> * Biden is assembling the next big White House priority, a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That would be on top of his recently signed $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus. The president met privately late Monday with Senate Democrats as Congress has already begun laying the groundwork with legislation for developing roads, hospitals and green energy systems as part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” campaign promise. While the goal is a bipartisan package, Democrats in Congress have signaled a willingness to go it alone if they’re blocked by Republicans.

mb5emp,,StockMarket,post,1616469763,"CRSR DD**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at it's current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering it's growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

mb4pen,,StockMarket,post,1616467419,"An update on the site I built that combines stock posts across social media For those unfamiliar with this project I basically built a site that takes posts from 24 different subreddits on reddit as well as from thousands of popular investing twitter, YouTube, and tiktok users and places them into one searchable and organized place all the while collecting data on popularity, sentiment, and price movement. Since the official release, I have built tools to help analyze that data and the result are pretty cool if I don't say so myself. Here are some of the features:

**CUSTOM STOCK ALERTS**

You can build your own email alert notifications to find trending stocks based off a range of parameters including; top number of stocks you want to check, social media/subreddits you want to check, time frame you want to check, and what sentiment you want to check. For example: Email me every time a ticker symbol enters the top 10 most talked about tickers across the subreddit(s): [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) and the social media site(s): twitter, tiktok that has not trended over the last 7 day(s) and has bullish sentiment.

**ADVANCED TRENDING**

You can see the trending stocks based off any investing subreddit/social media you choose, as well as pick how many days you want to check (up to 30) and the amount of trending stocks you want to see (up to 50). The site will then return: the amount of posts containing that stock as well as the overall sentiment for all the posts containing that stock. For example: Show me the top 25 most talked about stocks on the subreddits [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the social media site(s): youtube over the last 24 hours.

**Past Alerts**

Here you see your most recent trending stock alerts including: date/time, price at time of alert, sentiment at time of alert, current price, current sentiment, price change since alert, and sentiment change since the alert. At the top you can also see the overall price % change from alerts with bullish/bearish sentiment. This allows you to see which custom alerts give the best returns and help you build a winning strategy.

**STOCK/SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

This tool takes in a stock ticker and a time frame (1 day, 1 week, or 1 month). The site will then return:

1. The current stats of the stock: current price/price percent change, current sentiment, and amount of posts the stock has appeared in over the past day.
2. The overall change stats: This is the percent change in price, sentiment, and mentions over the time period specific by the user.
3. Day by day analysis: This will show the the day by day statistics of price, sentiment, and mentions over the time period specific by the user.
4. Posts by social media: This will show the total number of posts within the time period specified by the user and what social media those posts came from.

There are a few other features but these are the biggest ones that have the most value in my opinion. This site has grown to be the end all be all of analyzing social media trends and stock prices and has been an extremely fun project to work on. I wanted to share with you all and believe this could serve as useful of a tool for you guys as it has been for me :)

There are many sports platforms out there where you can gamble on eSports, such as Bet365, Pinnacle, Bovada, etc, however, there has never been a platform strictly dedicated to only gambling on eSports until now with Fandom Sports.

First, **why is eSports such a significant target?**

1. eSports ETF has launched on 3/22/21. Wall Street is starting to realize the long term growth and revenue possibilities in eSports.

2. eSports Audience Growth has increated from 143million viewers to 225million in 2020, and projected for 275million in 2022.

3. In 2019, the Super Bowl had 98 million viewers worldwide, the League of Legends World Championships had 137 million viewers (excluding China).

4. If eSports was its own sports in America, it would rank 3rd behind the NFL and NBA in viewership. Fandom Sports already has signed partnerships from their eSports platform in UK, UAE, and China.

-------------------------------------------

**Fan Engagement**

Fandom Sports will be the only eSports platform that will have ALL the following in iGaming:

1. Dynamic Betting Prepositions

2. Intelligent Odds Creation (Predicting Scores Live)

3. One-Off Tournament Capabilities

4. Dynamic Gaming License

5. Intelligent Analytics

6. Multiple Monetization Options for eSports

7. Online Rosters and Statistics

8. Full eSports Streaming

9. Localized Dynamic App Creation

-------------------------------------------

**NFTs**

NFT stocks have been all the hype, seeing some stocks jump 100% in 2 days.

Fandom Sports is now diving deep in the NFT world as well, being the first in eSports. Fandom Sports has already worked with top earning NFT artists (such as Daniel Mazzone and others), where NFTs will be used as incentives and prizes for the winning teams in eSport tournaments. 

-------------------------------------------

**Stock Information**

1. There is an extremely low float here of $37million on this stock. Every buying order here no matter the amount makes an impact on the price.

2. We have seen steady, healthy increases from $FDMSF on the charts - it still hasnt rocked like the other NTF stocks, and this stock has a bit more to with combining its platform with two big trending industries of eSports and NTFs.

-------------------------------------------

This is a start up company no doubt, but their progress thus far in 2021, shows me an ambitious, dedicated, executive team that are going after all the right targets and getting them done: already completing parternerships in UK, UAE, and China. 

1. Potential partnership with FunJoy in China leads to potential access to an existing userbase of 100m people in China. Advisory board is well connected to propel this company.

This is a long term hold - eSports, and the rise of NFTs are here to stay. Growing big time, and it is just the beginning for Fandom Sports, we can have a potential true money maker here.

Personal Target: $3 by the end of 2021.

Good luck all - **$FDMSF** or **$FDM.CN**",

Well I’m in the red right now in just about every stock I picked, I’ve got a few good ones but many have dipped, some 20-30% since purchase.

For everything you own you should be looking at both fundamental valuation and expectations as well as the technical picture of the stock.  If you don't have a fundamental valuation and price target it is very hard to decide to either buy or sell and you are left with trading on emotion which is literally the worst possibility.

You should go through every position you own and decide what it should be worth in the time frame you want to hold it for.  The time frame you should be looking at is > 1 year or you are probably not investing.  Once you have done that if you think it is a good position that will be worth more in that time frame, hold it and or add to it.  if you can't figure out what it should be worth get rid of it and find something you can put a value on.

If you don't like the level of gyration you are seeing in your portfolio you have probably also taken on more risk than you are actually comfortable with.  in that case take a step back and change the composition to carry less risk.",

I’m fairly new to dividend trading and I’m wondering when I can sell the stock but still get my dividend?

Here is what the companies saying about the dividend:
“

FIRST DISTRIBUTION
The Board of Directors proposes that the final day for trading in shares entitling shareholders to dividend be set for April 12, 2021, and that the first day of trading in shares excluding rights to dividend be set for April 13, 2021. The recommended record date at Euroclear Sweden for the right to receive dividend will be April 14, 2021. If the AGM votes to approve the Board’s proposals, the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden on April 19, 2021.
“

Does this mean I can sell on the 13th or do I have to wait until the 19th?
Trading via Stockholm stock market if that makes any difference.

Last Close Price **103,50 €** 

Okay market is full of opportunities, but I want to tell you of a stock that's underrated in general.Long term, short term, how the world looks at it.

**Just underrated.** Let me tell you why and you will think differently about your Top 10 stocks.

Seeing it crawling around 103.00 is deliciously cheap in price.   
SAP *(software company focused mainly on business processes)*   
got a lot of attraction when it was missing goals   
and the market dropped it  31.1 % from 140 to 90 Euro.

A lot of key people were seeing the market very wrong here and they were right.  
SAP quickly recovered into 100.00 - 110.00.   
While there is not a lot resistance between 107.00 - 112.00,   
there is a strong resistance at 105.00 - 106.00  
Also there is a good opportunity of the price going down to 95.00-100.00  
In that case I see a great buying option, which I see already.

# People tend to forget this

* Guys, we are talking about the most valuable company in Germany!   
And the only German company in the Top 100 international.
* The biggest non-american and third biggest software company on the planet.
* SAP is the most used in its market got 24% of the market share.(followed by Oracle 12%, Sage 6%)
* 425,000 SAP customers in more than 180 countries.
* 202 of the 250 top retailers of the world use SAP
* 46 of the 50 world’s secured banks uses SAP 
* 8/8 of the innovative automobile companies across the world run the SAP as the solution
* 7 out of 10 world-class hospitals use SAP solution
* Some of the big companies that use SAP as the solution are DHL, BMW, eBay, Airbus, Samsung Electronics, amongst others. 
* There are software markets and special courses that a lot of people working and consulting with SAP learned and specialized further in. SAP is part of the digital infrastructure of the world. Before you change the street system, you will look if you can optimize it.
* So even if the company goes completely crazy, there is a global interest in repairing whatever went wrong, before you write it off. Having a worst case scenario like this, is highly valuable for a company, this is A class security. 

Let's talk about the **key people** that were mentioned:

* Hasso Plattner (*founder, ex CEO, supervisory board chairman and a lot more for SAP, multiple citizen honors, philantropist*) just invested a quarter billion and bought SAP stocks after the drop.
* A lot of other leaders and investors of SAP bought plenty of the low priced stock.
* All the news were like 'whoa actually nobody thinks SAP is worth that little, market just panicked bc you know we have a crisis and a lot of 'tech is not invulnerable' headlines'. Resluted in positive reaction from private investors.

&#x200B;

# Here is a good question to ask: 

***Why is SAP crawling around 103 instead of following the analysts expectations and break out over 120?*** 

Let's go step by step

This is a good question, because from above we know the *media told people to buy SAP*,   
I know personally of non trading people that were interested in what happened to SAP or also interested in buying it.   


1. You now know, media told people to buy SAP
2. Even non-trading people had a feeling that a  31.1 % price drop is suspicious for a stock like SAP.
3. Analysts expected to recover to 120 already and still are rock steady in their opinion, also raising expectations.
4. They're raising expectations because SAP has overperformed and the stock price went down.
5. They developed new solutions to expand their previously non cloud products to be cloudbased. This is upgrading a very high number of businesses in their technological development.
6. When the markets went up, SAP missed to move.
7. Until now we still have good news about SAPs future business and guess what.
8. It's still far from 120, but it made some attempts. And this is the breakpoint here.  


# SAP didn't move with the market.

There are a lot of stocks that moved in the same pattern and were influenced simliarly by the market. SAP though, was excluded by most of the movements and moved sideways during the last weeks and months.

# SAP is still very hot.

While we see other undervalued stocks recovering again, I believe next month will be the deciding outbreak of SAP. Especially now when everyone tends to forget that this stock has over 40% potential, this will be the time of resistance declining.

# Psychology and numbers

Sometimes you have what I simpilfy as a ""too good to be true"" stock.   
This is more about the psychology of the people taking actions on the market, than about the stock itself.

In SAP's case, **short term traders** were very successful between 90 and 100, and from 100 to 112.Most strategies would recommend to wait from now on.They made a lot of profit and the 120 mark is a big one, so they sit that one out.

Now here comes why a 103 sideways movement could be actually a good signal.

This is where ""too good to be true"" is complemented by ""too unreal to happen"". During the sideway movement, the stock price was rarely going between 101-102.Not scratching the 100.

So even when the short term hype left the stock, you could see the steady support assuming it's rather not believed the stock should be less than three digits worth.If you look up the analysts opinions they tend towards a 125 goal and 136 if it performs well.

See, ""too good to be true"" also means forces on the market, seeing that people see that. They know how and when people react to the stock and try to push the price down at the right times for the right period.

It seems for me that either the price will drop to 95 and this will be the best time to buy, or if it moves further sideways the next three weeks, it will crack the 105-106 and continue from there on steady towards 120. The resistance between 107-112 didn't seem very strong to me and I believe there is enough of investors who bought SAP long term.

BAE Systems PLC is Britains biggest  provider to it's military. Were not talking machine guns, pistols,  uniforms. We are talking, Frigates, Fighter Jets, Cyber warfare etc.

I've  been in the Royal Navy for 8 years now and I have worked directly with  BAE civillian contractors throughout my career. The amount of staff BAE  have and will carry on employing have almost tripled due to the two new  aircraft carriers that have been built and have to by law be maintained  by BAE for the next 50 years or so.

Along  with the Royal Navy BAE also provide for the Army. Now there is a lot  of rumors and talk about getting rid of entire infantry regiments. Six  Regiments infact and using the money towards a future modern warfare,  (Cyber warfare mainly).

Who will have the contracts for the future of the armys warfare? yep BAE.

However,  BAE's top brass are absolutely useless. I've never seen a deadline met.  Most of the ships they build have serious problems which need  rectifing, (the 6 destroyers that were built). This could lead to BAE  losing future contracts to other competitors to which there are a few.  But they would really have to mess up for this to happen.

I've done my DD and I can see this stock dropping more as the company has been affected by Coronavirus.

Saying  that, I think it's a great Long term investment as the German Parliment  have purchased a further 38 typhoon jets. This is relevant as the  British Government buoyed by brexit need to respond and they have  already pledged a further 2% of GPD at least to military spending.

**To cut a long story short, BAE has a bright future. A lot of money is going to be put into the compnay in the next few years. Predictions are that by the end of the year it will rise over 20.9%**",
mbjl13,gryk8uj,StockMarket,comment,1616525180,"I've worked for BAE Systems, Inc. the (I believe) wholly-owned subsidiary of BAE Systems, PLC. I believe all the large government defense contractors are somewhat similar (monolithic, inefficient, bureaucratic) and growth is more important than efficiency or innovation.

If I were going to invest in a defense contractor today, it would be one that is innovating and growing and has good financials, not one that (as you point out) has lots of current problems. 

I would invest in Lockheed-Martin (LMT).",['LMT']
mbaib2,,StockMarket,post,1616490199,"Historical Index Data Hi there!

I  would like to test some ideas trading with options on the German stock index (DAX). The idea is to just trade on the volatility rather than if it's going up or down (e.g. buying a put and call option at the same time with a specific stop-loss). But I need to test if that is possible, therefore I need some historical data: I'd like to have the share price of the DAX every 5 minutes over the last 3 months. Is there a platform where I can download that data? I was searching for it already, but couldn't find satisfying results. If there is data for other stock indices (NASDAQ, Dow Jones, S&P 500, CSI 300, Nikkei) as well, that would be extra points!

Thanks for your help!

Alongside this, the BoC are also comparatively more hawkish than the RBA with the former possibly looking to taper QE purchases in April. Elsewhere, positioning also signals that AUD/CAD is asymmetrically tilted to the downside given that AUD net-longs are somewhat stretched from a historical basis. On the technical front, the 0.9700 handle remains a stumbling block for AUD/CAD upside, while support at 0.9600-20 has curbed further losses for now. As it stands, the cross remains in a short-term range, however, I favour fade rallies in the cross.",
mbhrmq,,StockMarket,post,1616514776,"I just bought ADBEI’ve been thinking about buying ADBE for a long time and with the stock 15% below its 52-week high (and earnings coming up), this might be a good buying opportunity. So before I made my decision, I decided to look at some [alternative data points](https://dillibits.com/?t=ADBE). This is what I found.

**Not a popular stock on social media**

Adobe is only being mentioned a handful of times per day on social media platforms such as Reddit and StockTwits. But the bullish sentiment is high, currently sitting at 78%.

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, we can see some minor growth with about 20 new followers per day on Facebook and 320 new followers on Instagram.

**Traffic is going up**

Despite the “low interest” on social media, web traffic for Adobe is significantly up. [Adobe.com](http://adobe.com/) had an estimate of 129M visitors in February, up by almost 20% since September last year.

The Adobe Target product is growing in popularity which could be an indicator of growth for Adobe’s Marketing products.

**Customer Satisfaction remains high**

Adobe's Net Promoter Score (NPS) is sitting at 39 (a good score since [NPS](https://www.comparably.com/brands/adobe#nps) is a grade from -100 to 100) with 60% Promoters, 19% Passives, and 21% Detractors. And that number gets even more impressive when longterm clients are surveyed. Clients that have used Adobe’s products for over 10 years gives the company a 67.

**Increase in patents**

Innovation never sleeps at Adobe, at least not if you’re looking at patent fillings. Just in the last quarter, Adobe has added over 200 patents to their portfolio. Now this is on par with companies such as Oracle and Salesforce, but it’s still an impressive number. Some of their latest [patents](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0000796343) focuses on machine learning and neural networks - lots of cool innovative ideas!

**Workforce is growing and employees are satisfied**

According to their SEC filings in 2013, Adobe had 11k employees. Last year, they reportedly had over 22k employees. Impressive growth, and around the same growth as Apple. And it seems like Adobe is not slowing down. Right now they have 1,464 open positions, up from 294 in mid December last year.

Current employees are also satisfied, the average employee rating is 4.4 (out of 5) which would mean a higher employee satisfaction than Oracle and Microsoft. Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen, is getting stellar reviews from the employees, 4.9 out of 5.

The stock might a bit expensive relative to competitors and current earnings, but based on the data, and with [ESG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE/sustainability/) Risk ratings being low and revenue almost doubling in the last four years, I think Adobe has a lot more room to grow and so I add the stock to my portfolio this morning.

Note: This is not financial advice. Do your own DD.

So first up is Vodafone Group PLC (VOD); a company that pays semiannual dividends with a 5.7% yield, a current price around $18.65, a PT between $22.60-$25.48, an average PT of $24.04 and a P/B ratio of only .76. Looking at these numbers alone it seems like VOD is undervalued and when you look at their expansion into Africa and India as well as cementing their status as Europe’s discount cell service for all backpackers/tourists/Americans stationed overseas (they actually have contracts with the US military to sell their phones and chips directly to Americans on base in the military’s PX’s and BX’s)/students studying abroad you can see how qualitatively they also have a lot going for them. Personally I’m looking to begin dollar cost averaging in to VOD as I find both their yield and growth prospects attractive. Not to mention I used them while I was living in Germany and so did every single kid in my school. 

The second company I would like to discuss with y’all is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE) or for those of us in the states (DTEGY). DTEGY pays only a yearly dividend with a 3.47% yield and trades around $19.65 with a PT range between $15.53-$29.82, an average TP of $23.85 and a much more average P/B ratio of 2.16. While these numbers aren’t as great as VOD it is still the largest telecommunication provider in all of Europe, and also owns like 45% of T-mobile so they are getting a large amount of revenue from America’s 3rd largest cellular network. While I haven’t found anything on them expanding into emerging markets I have seen their recent huge investments into 5G and how they are making moves to solidify their 5G network to maintain their largest in Europe status. 

So do y’all have any thoughts on VOD and DTEGY? Personally I’m going to be buying a few shares of both and just watch how 5G continues to roll out. I also like them as they offer me some international exposure and diversification. Personally I hate AT&T due to dealing with them for years as a customer and as such don’t want to invest in them but still want some more communication sector diversification outside of VZ and DIS that still pays a decent dividend.

max8zy,,StockMarket,post,1616445191,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 22, 2021Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

Are we in range, focusing on day structure... Digging out a new range? We created a new upper end of the range now what's the lower end of the range. When looking at candles sticks on a chart there is a lot of information given to you at a glance. One bit of info I pay attention to is inside days versus outside days. Looking at a daily candle stick chart, if the current candle at close is bigger than the previous candle, I call it and outside day. It signals range expansion and high volatility. If the previous candle on a daily chart is bigger than the current candle at its close then you have and inside day which signals lower volatility and consolidation. Along with this are a couple of candle stick patterns you should become familiar with, the piercing pattern and dark cloud cover.  Dark cloud cover usually confirms resistance and the piercing pattern usually confirms support. I won't go to deep into it here but you can search google for images of both. Continue to keep your eyes on Bonds and Rates for any sharp moves that will anger the overall market.  As we Continue to focus on understanding day structure and identifying them as early as possible. A lot of focus on range days and there many different versions. Now the 4 outcomes to prepare for today are 1) Can we hold above 388 area. If so, we push toward 392 area and possibly 393. Be careful of quick down moves that may retest the low of the range. 2) we Consolidate between 388 and 392 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. 4) Trend day structure down. We have an opening gap lower from yesterdays close, we try to fill the gap and fail with a target of 388 area. 

1) Can we hold above 390 area. If so, we push toward 392 area and possibly 393. Be careful of quick down moves that may retest the low of the range. **40% probability** 

2) we Consolidate between 388 and 391 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. **10% probability** 

3) Trend day structure down. We have an opening gap lower from yesterdays close, we try to fill the gap and fail with a target of 388 area. **50% probability**","['GOOGL', 'GPS']"

You want to cause a short squeeze. This is where you have the potential to cause one. 

Today is a battle and bulls will win! If the 50 day and 30 MA’s can stay above 7.75 we’re making bread.

March 23, 2021 Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (""Neptune"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:[NEPT](https://www.webull.com/quote/nasdaq-nept)) (TSX:NEPT), a diversified and fully integrated health and wellness company focused on natural, plant-based, sustainable and purpose-driven lifestyle brands, today announced that Health Canada has provided the Company with a license amendment to allow it to sell dried cannabis flower and pre-rolled cannabis in the Canadian recreational market.

Neptune currently supplies the market with premium cannabis extracts, under its Mood Ring™ and PanHash™ brands, and will expand its offering to include all regulated product categories. This empowers the Company to provide a comprehensive portfolio, enhance its total addressable market and target the lucrative flower segment, which is a dominant force in the industry both in sales and revenue. 

""Dried flower and associated products derived therefrom will be the latest additions to Neptune's collection of cannabis products, which includes High CBD Oil, High CBD Oil Capsules and Legacy Hashish,"" said Neptune Wellness Solutions' President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Cammarata.

The license amendment enables Neptune to leverage trusted partnerships across its supply chain to acquire unique and highly sought-after cultivars. The Company's dried flower will be carefully selected and curated by an award-winning cannabis sommelier, and then hand packaged in premium packaging. This ensures that the integrity and quality of the carefully sourced flower will be maintained and preserved to provide supreme quality for the customer. The ability to source exceptional flower from any licensed producer will afford flexibility to maximize emerging commercial opportunities and will safeguard Neptune from increased industry volatility.

""This is a very exciting time for Neptune, allowing us to sell all categories of recreational cannabis to meet the demands of our Canadian consumers,"" said Mr. Cammarata. ""We are excited to bring to market premium dried cannabis flower products that are packaged to preserve their quality and profile."" 

Today's announcement follows Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. entering into a letter of intent with Société québécoise du cannabis (SQDC), the province's sole legal retailer for recreational cannabis, for the sale of Neptune's new cannabis brand, PanHash™.

As Neptune continues to redefine the recreational cannabis market, the Company has pledged to align with cultivators that share its core values of sustainability, accountability and excellence to furnish the industry with superior cannabis flower. All cannabis products are manufactured and packaged at the Company's purpose-built facility in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

maus2g,,StockMarket,post,1616438599,"I built a program that spots buzzing stocks on Reddit & Twitter. Here are the resultsHello all, I have built a python program that scrapes Reddit & twitter to identify emerging stocks.

# How does it work?

It does this by assessing the amount a stock is mentioned, the sentiment of the chatter surrounding that stock (how positive or negative that chatter is) and the interactions surrounding that chatter (upvotes, likes, retweets etc.)

The algorithm surfaces emerging stocks by looking at which stocks have seen a regular, non-spiky increase in chatter surrounding a stock.

The algorithm tries to remove pump and dump stocks by filtering out the short interest group of stocks (BB, NOK, GME, AMC etc), removing stocks that have seen a single spike in chatter, and ignoring chatter by newly created accounts.

# How to use this?

The tool is meant to be used as a way to identify stocks early, enabling you to perform research and enter into a stock at an early stage. It has allowed me to identify opportunities such as PLUG, SRNE, PLTR and MGNA.

*Just because something appears here does not mean you should purchase it. Please do your own research beforehand!*

# Results

There are two sets of results, showing the stocks with the biggest movement in chatter, and the stocks that were talked about the most.

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders.

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley. Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1. Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth.
2. Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin.

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue.

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR.

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to.

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded.

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million.

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season.

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

mbeotn,,StockMarket,post,1616505999,"Over Excessive Government Spendings cause massive inflation and destroy American DollarBy now, everyone should get the news about Biden's plan to pass another $3 Trillion plan to jump start economy again. We just passed $1.9 Trillion stimulus package to get everyone back to work. I don't think the market can stomach another $3 Trillion bill. 

I am not a professional market analyst but I just feel this spending is moving too fast. Excessive American stimulus packages already cause massive inflations around the world. 

As you know, most of consumer products are imported from outside the country. Americans actually spend and buy more than previous year.  The price of products are going up by 20% to 30% because suppliers can't keep up the demands for America.  

Inflation is not good for Economy. High Inflation mean lower return for the Bank and everyone else including your wallet.  You spend more to get the same product. This mean American Dollar became depreciated and lost its value much faster than previous years.

Another big inflation is the high price of Oil. Many banks are forced to stop investing in Oil Companies because they don't want to have Negative Public Reputations. This means smaller oil companies are forced to shut down and couldn't compete against major Oil companies. This result in higher oil price that everyone has to pay. $4 per Gallon GAS is not cheap!!!

Federal Reserve already can't control the interest rate. With this new $3 Trillion spending bill in the same year will cause massive Inflation. This will most likely trigger a major Sell OFF in the stock market.",
mbeotn,grxdpzg,StockMarket,comment,1616506499,"I find the best analogy for a good economy is the practice of the forestry departments. Used to be that their policy was to immediately put out any forest fire. Well....this caused a lot of build up of dry brush on the forest floors, which resulted in larger fires that were harder and harder to control. It also limited the growth of new trees and vegetation, as the fires helped to control over growth and provide nutrients into the soil. Eventually the fires became more than they could handle. 

Now there are controlled burns to allow prosperous growth and forest life. Obviously there are going to be fires that get out of hand, or fires that cause wide spread damage, but over all the forests are healthier for the allowed natural destruction rather than the full blown preservation mind set.

People don't buy used or new CDs they use the Market Places on their favorite consoles to purchase games, when the prices drop.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-22.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq futures rise as 10-year Treasury yield retreats

> * The Nasdaq on Monday was set to build on Friday’s nearly 0.8% increase as the 10-year Treasury yield started the new week retreating from last week’s 14-month high. The rapid rise in Treasury yields this year have been pressuring growth stocks, many of them tech names, tech stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, which lost ground Friday, joined the Nasdaq in negative territory for the week. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs Wednesday, while the Nasdaq last closed at a record in February.

> # 2. AstraZeneca vaccine found to be 79% effective in U.S. trial

> * AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness, according to data published Monday from a 32,000-plus person Phase 3 trial in the U.S. The two-shot vaccine also showed a 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. AstraZeneca plans to file with the FDA for emergency use authorization in April. The U.S. trial data comes as a number of European nations temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. AstraZeneca said in a release Monday that an independent board identified no safety concerns related to its inoculation.

> # 3. Covid cases are rising in 21 states as governors relax restrictions

> * Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates in the U.S., Covid cases are increasing in 21 states and highly infectious variants are spreading as governors relax restrictions on businesses. Public health officials warn that while roughly 2.5 million people around the country are receiving shots every day, infection levels have plateaued this month. Nationwide, new infections are holding around 54,000 on average in the past seven days. That’s a dramatic drop from January’s peak. While deaths are much lower as well, an average of 1,000 people were still dying from Covid each day over the past seven days.

> # 4. Canadian Pacific Railway to buy Kansas City Southern

> * Canadian Pacific Railway has agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The combination would create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Following Sunday’s announcement, shares of Kansas City Southern rose about 17% in the premarket, while shares of Canadian Pacific Railway dropped about 2.5%. The deal comes as hopes that U.S.-Mexico trade will pick up now that Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as U.S. president.

> # 5. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sees Tesla reaching $3,000 per share by 2025

> * Shares of Tesla rose 4% in Monday’s premarket after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made a long-awaited, bold call, projecting the Elon Musk-led electric auto maker would more than quadruple by 2025. Last year, Ark Invest estimated Tesla would hit $1,400 adjusted for its five-for-one stock split by 2024. The firm now sees the stock reaching $3,000 per share by 2025 in its base case, and reaching $4,000 per share in its bull case. Wood’s bear case still sees hit hitting $1,500 by 2025. Tesla, which closed at $654 per share Friday, soared 665% in the past 12 months. However, the stock over the past month and year-to-date hit a rough patch.

📷

New Week same old worries... Can we keep the music playing and start walking back up the stairs or will this week be more like walking on a tread mill, a lot of energy spent but end up in the same place we started. Continue to keep your eyes on Bonds and Rates for any sharp moves that will anger the overall market.  Also Continue to focus on understanding day structure and identifying that as early as possible. A lot of focus will be on Range day structure, and notice how indicators like Bollinger bands, Keltner channels and price channels are more effective during these types of days. Now the 3 outcomes to prepare for today are 1) Can we hold above 390. If so, we push toward 392 area and possibly 393 if not today later this week. Be careful of quick down moves that may retest the low of the range. 2) we Consolidate between 388 and 392 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower3) we hold 390 support area and get a trend up day toward 393. 

1) Can we hold above 390. If so, we push toward 392 area and possibly 393 if not today later this week. Be careful of quick down moves that may retest the low of the range. **50% probability** 

2) we Consolidate between 388 and 392 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. **40% probability** 

3) we hold 390 support area and get a trend up day toward 393. **10% probability**

marp3s,,StockMarket,post,1616430563,"INVE--A story of Many Irons in the Fire. NFC and RFID chip boom could lead to hypergrowth for Identiv, a key manufacturer.***Identiv has Many Irons in the Fire.*** It is a small company, but despite that, it has several different interesting businesses and markets--each of which on its own could potentially lead to huge profits for the company. 



***RFID/NFC chip business.*** 

This is the one most talked about on reddit.

The Fruit Company:  On its earnings calls, INVE has signaled a close relationship with the fruit company on NFC technology. Hopefully INVE is involved in the new iTag or whatever they will call it. Regardless, the iPhone's adoption of NFC beyond applepay has opened the floodgates for NFC consumer tech adoption. 

Just as the Sony Playstation was a blue-ray player leading to massive blue-ray growth, the iPhone is now an RFID and NFC reader and interface which will likely lead to a huge amount of growth in the space. I cannot oversell this point enough. Everyone has an RFID and NFC reader in their hands.  

Technology edge: INVE appears to have a competitive advantage in designing and manufacturing custom NFC and RFID chips. It certainly doesn't hurt that their relationship with Apple means they likely have intimate knowledge of the most used NFC/RFID reader's tech. Additionally, they have a unique ability to produce them on cardboard for environmental reasons as well.

Broader RFID market: The RFID market is booming with warehousing and shipping booming, tracking is becoming a necessity. 

Recent Results: INVE grew RFID revenues 100% yoy in 4Q. 
APU is growing as well, leading to possibly higher margins for INVE in the space. 

INVE is a leader in the space in a growing market with growing margins. Soon comes the huge profits hopefully.

(and UWB may add to the story here as well.)


***Premises Commercial, Switch to Cloud and recurring revenue.***

Identiv has revamped the way it sells its premises security systems. Instead of just selling its systems for installers to install, INVE is pushing a services model through the cloud. This system will allow the customer to get better value from Identiv with more support, increased flexibility in the system, and better data. 

Importantly, this generates recurring revenue. Instead of getting a 1 time 40-60% margin sale, INVE can recoup its entire cost and breakeven in its first year of revenue and continually generate that same revenue year after year. As the years go own sales will go from 0% margin to 50% margin to 67% margin to 75% margin to 80% margin. Each year INVE is able to keep the customer happy and upgrade it's systems, margins will go up and up and up.


***Government Business***

The government business is growing rapidly due to INVE’s technology edge. Both the Thursby Identity unit and the Hirsch velocity accesss control units are performing here. 
From the 4Q20 earnings transcript:
“In 2020, the federal government remains a strong growth driver. Our federal sales grew 30% year-over-year. Driven by our technology strength and by work from home and work mobile demand. We had key deployments at the Department of Energy, Treasury, NIST [ph] FBI and IRS offices nationwide, VA hospitals, multiple secret service facilities, Air Force bases worldwide and lots of others.” 

“In the area of federal government expansion we expect the 30% growth in our federal business to continue as the new administration emphasizes physical security and cyber security. With our product superiority, we expect to continue to grow our share even in a healthy spending federal government market. Among recent wins than the federal government, we're securing the Secret Service headquarters, field offices and all the places basic here [ph]. Our security leadership also is behind some rather urgent delivery orders we recently got for the U.S. House of Representatives in the capital. And we'll share more wins and expansions throughout 2021.”

INVE added  retired Navy Vice Admiral Robin Braun to its board in 2019, which should hopefully help the company better understand the federal market and market its technology leading products in a way that resonates with key government stakeholders


***in Summation***

INVE’s market cap of $200mn leaves a lot of room for growth, however as an investment, it has to start breaking even or generating profit or shares will be diluted by additional capital raised. Humphrey has mentioned $100mn a year in revenue as a possible breakeven inflection point, which INVE could hit this year.

My thesis is that INVE has many areas for growth and if INVE is able to have a big success in any one of its core areas, that growth could carry the entire business past the inflection point. In other words, it has Many Irons in the Fire!! Once INVE becomes profitable it will help to alleviate its relatively tight working capital situation and drive less restricted investment and decision making, in turn creating more growth + profits. 

I think it’s possible for INVE to achieve a Fortune 500 valuation in a decade. 


(i am not telling any of you cretans to buy the stock, just providing my take. The market is a fickle beast and INVE is a tiny unprofitable company, so anything can happen.)

ma3ueh,,StockMarket,post,1616354326,"Cathie Wood: Inflation vs Deflationary forcesIn a recent video, Cathie goes back in time to the end of 2016 - Early 2017.

Quantitative easing was on its way out and the FED was going to start raising the interest rates. The market was very nervous...

Trump won the election and the odds of a cyclical burst increased because of his promise to cut taxes and that's exactly what happened!

In the beginning the equity market was very nervous around the idea that interest rates would be going up. When Trump was elected - value stock took off just like they're getting off now - responding to this idea that economy is developing ahead of steam so the value stocks have taken off.

If you look at year to date: energy stocks are up 27%, financial stocks 11%, tech stock 1% and health stocks are actually down. So basically traditional value stocks are having a nice run! So right now we are in a 2016 like scenario, value stocks are up and growth strategy stocks are down (Take ARK ETFs as a perfect example)

Cathie thinks this is great because the bull market is broadening out to other sectors and this - can only be a good thing for ""disruptive innovation"" stocks investors.

What would be negative instead? It would be a negative thing if the bull market continues to narrow and only innovation strategy worked, because that's what happened with the .com tech bubble in 2000. (And we all know how bad the consequences have been).

Cathie actually likes the fear that ARK is experiencing and that there's a reality check, in terms of the speculative moves that have taken place within the innovation space.

What happened post Q4 2016 after the market had broadened out? Well… 2017 was a fantastic year for the equity market in general with cyclical value and growth.  And she believes we're now moving towards a similar scenario.

Now let's find out what Cathie's said on Bitcoin being speculative, not sustainable, not environment friendly and heavily used for illicit activities. With a lot of respect Cathie says that Janet Yellen doesn't understand the crypto space, simply because it's not her main focus.

Regarding the environmental issue: comparing the energy required for BTC mining to the energy required to mine gold you can clearly see that the first is a fraction of the latter. It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC. 

She also reports what an FBI agent told her. According to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets. BTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.

Talking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases. So it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech. Regarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction… it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin. And the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.

Cathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation. ARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other. Good vs bad deflation. Good deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.

* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.
* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly. And according to ARK forecasts… EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.

Concluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:

* Robotics
* AI
* Blockchain
* DNA sequencing

And these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect. Think about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.

On the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned. The disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change. Financial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around. Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.

So we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.

&#x200B;

Let me set the scene right now. You’ve just spent three hours doing intense research finding the perfect stock to buy and hold for the next couple of days so you can reap in the wonderful profits. The market opens you find your option contract - exact strike and date - set your limit sell and BAM! You’re in.

>Market’s moving.  
You’re suddenly up 10% within minutes.  
A few minutes later your stock has increased eighty cents and you’re 30% up. Wow!  
Five minutes later you’re sitting at 65% gains.  
This is unbelievable.  
What’s going on!?  
You tell yourself you need to sell.  
But you can’t. You have no day trades available.  
Oops.

How many times have you found yourself in a similar situation? Of course, those profits may be exaggerated but there might be a time when you expected to hold overnight for 10-15% and suddenly find yourself above that. It can be frustrating because what happens if you hold? What happens if the stock pulls back and the sellers start taking profit. Are you going to be left behind? In many cases you will. However, it doesn’t have to be that way!

We can actually lock in profits right now even without a day trade available.

Say whaaaa????

Yep! You can do this by opening a Vertical Spread. Now because we aren’t buying together it won’t be 1 contract. However, it acts as the same.

So how do we do this?

It’s simple! Let’s look at an example:

Let’s say we purchased a put on BAC with the $38 strike price and a April 1st expiration and we got in with an 65 cent buy. Now our option is trading at $1.10 and we want to lock in gains.

**So what we do is the following:**

1. Go to the April 1st expirations for BAC.
2. Instead of looking at the BUY options look at the SELL
3. Since we purchased the $38 Put we want to SELL a put contract and decide to sell the $37.5 Put for 46 cents.
4. We now receive a $46.00 credit

So as of right now what have we done? Well, we are up $45.00 per contract on our original buy. We have now sold our second contract and received a credit of $46.00. Assuming nothing more happens and tomorrow the stock opens up exactly the same we may lose a little value to theta and the morning spread but essentially you’ll be up about the same amount.

**Now, whenever you go to cash in the next morning you have to do the following:**

1. **BUY** back the contract you sold. To do this all you have to do is go to the $37.5 Put and **BUY** the contract. This will relieve you from the contract you sold.
2. Once you have bought back the contract you sold you will be left with your original option contract that you bought. So now you need to close out this original contract.
3. Do your happy dance and make it rain dollar dollar bills!

Opening a Vertical Spread can help lock in money. It doesn’t always work though. If the stock begins to decrease in value overnight you may end up losing money on the original contract but because you sold a contract at the higher price as it decreases in value the more money you get to keep from it. However, let’s say something dramatic happens and the stock gaps down well below your original entry. Sure, you may be up on the credit sell you made but you might be down so far on the original contract that overall you’re now losing. The great thing is though even if you hadn’t opened the Vertical Spread you would have been down so essentially by doing the spread you limit the loss a bit.

Now, let’s say the next morning BAC continues to rise and has gapped up and your original contract has increased by another 20%. Well, you’re going to be down on the contract you sold as it has increased, but the original option is going to be worth more so by hedging with the **SELL** contract you have essentially safely locked in gains without risking too much of your capital overnight.",['BAC']

Tech 100 futures, however, are looking good.

I don't base too much on Nikkei, but am very interested to see how Taiwan and Hong Kong start the week. Those markets will start opening in just over 30m.

A few key thoughts I'm having:

1. I need to be ready to hedge for any loss that may be incurred by my tech-heavy portfolio, should there be a major shift in that sector (invested heavily in what I believe to be the bottom)

2.1 Will the upswing in oil Friday spill into this week? The Saudi's said Friday's attacks did not impact production, however that's basically what I would expect of them to say. But, then again, it's Aramco and it's capable of immense output to make up for the temporary disruption

2.2 Saudi's made an attack against Houthi rebel's, will there be some sort of retaliation this week? Could be worthwhile to have a put/call strategy in place -definitely worthwhile unless oil trades sideways

3. Qualcomm CEO had positive remarks with regard to the chip shortage... QUAL reached what I believe to be a bottom, and is one of the blue-chip stocks of the tech world. Would a play on QUAL be better than a play in AMD? Probably safer... Or would something like SOXL calls be better given the possibility of supply catching up to demand in the near term?

I am new to stocks. I just started buying a few months back when I became a working student to help my family with our financial crisis (which is caused by the pandemic).

I noticed that stock prices have been plummeting since the time I invested and there has been no profit since. I have considered that I may just be panicking because I'm new to stocks and that I should just hold. But I've already lost 10% of what I initially invested and the stock values are still going down.

I tried to read up on some factors that affect stock prices and one of them was politics. 

Our government is excessively borrowing money from other nations for ""emergency covid responses"" but I'm sure that the politicians have already pocketed everything for the upcoming elections (and just for their own good). We're on lockdown again and there has been no vaccinations. Vaccines btw, will be coming from private institutions who are forced by the government to donate the exact number of vaccines they'll be procuring for themselves to the government.

I'm not very good at studying the economy but I'm sure that excessive debts will cause our economy to plummet. And I'm thinking that this might be the reason why the stock shares I bought had been plummeting too. 

I'm sure that we will not be able to pay back our debts to other nations anytime soon. But I'm worried that this will also cause the stock market in our country to just crash. But I don't know much about the stock market to be sure.

maaoct,grs9agj,StockMarket,comment,1616393408,"It depends on what form the borrowing takes. You can't ask this just in general and get useful answers.

Here in the US, our government doesn't actually borrow money at all; when Americans talk about national debt, they're talking about how many Treasury Bonds have been issued. This makes it very safe; if we couldn't afford it, we'd only have to weaken our currency a little bit to reduce the debt. That would be slightly bad for us, so we wouldn't want to do it. But not a disaster.

A small country, it depends who you borrowed the money from, and what the guarantees are. If you borrowed it from China, your government agreed to turn anything over to them that they ask for if it can't be paid; your strategic national industries are the collateral, so if it can't be paid you're screwed.

If you borrowed it from the US, Europe, or similar, you're only risking your credit rating.👼",

ma93g7,,StockMarket,post,1616369276,"BNGO Earnings Likely Outcomes (could b wrong) 

Using the 3.8-4.2M dollar preliminary estimate from Erik and the BNGO team, I was able (I think lol unless I forgot or missed something, comment below if I screwed something up) to estimate and label the probabilities (imo) of each tier's exact EPS coming to fruition.

TLDR - IN MY OPINION, BNGO earnings, based primarily but not solely on the revenue estimates Erik (BNGO CEO) gave in a recent presentation, are extremely likely to beat the $-0.07 eps estimate from marketbeat, and a very likely chance to beat the $-0.05 eps estimate from yahoo average estimate.

DISCLAIMER (just give it a skim especially if you catch something I missed/neglected when making the calculations) - Please before saying this or that is wrong, please read this or at least skim it - I can easily be wrong about my calculations because I could have missed something. ALSO, I DID NOT SAY THIS IN THE VIDEO BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT - The total expenses I choose for all 5 tiers were basically just guesses going from unlikely (in a bearish way) to being fair to being unlikely (in a bullish way) basically. Because of this, THE EXACT EPS ESTIMATES I HAVE MADE ARE NOT IMPLYING THAT I THINK BNGO EARNINGS WILL ONLY BE 1 OF THEM EXACTLY ON THE CENT. It just means that that ones with the higher % chance I labeled them with will mean that for BNGO earnings, there is a higher chance actual EPS will turn out to be near or exactly in one of the tiers with higher chances in my opinion. It would have maybe been better to have a bit of a range of EPS estimates but that is more complicated because then I would have to do more total expenses guestimations and for a range I do not know exactly how that would have worked. I know this may seem complex and I could be wrong but I think based on this research that BNGO (as stated in video) has a higher change of beating earnings than missing in my opinion.

This below is what I typed in a google doc and presented/explained on my youtube channel link to the video here - [I Calculated Several BNGO Earnings Possibilities, What I Think (maybe) I Found Is Very Interesting - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1P0IJXzAo)

If just reading some things will seem a little out of place like the 'IF \_\_\_\_ IS NOT TRUE' part right near the top. But all in all I will just attempt to sum it up here articulately.

I assumed for all net income calculations that revenue is 4M (average of preliminary estimates in Erik's presentation) and for the total expenses (variable that changes in each 5 tiers) I started with the worst case scenario (in my mind, but technically speaking they could have a much higher total expenses than what I assumed, in my assumptions I did a number which was more than double the average quarterly total expenses from 2017-2019 average and in this of course you actually want if you are a bull, to have lower total expenses, so that is why I doubled instead of halved) and moved up to more optimistic total expense number (lower) or revenue (higher) as long as it is the same proportion if that makes any sense. I think it will make more sense and before we get into it realize this formula if you do not already know (Net income) - (Preferred dividends) = (Net proceeds) Divided by (Shares Outstanding) = Basic EPS

and if the format looks weird it is because it is originally in google doc form but I copy and pasted it here

**PRESENTING ALL MY EVIDENCE AND SITES THAT I USED FOR ALL OF THIS AFTER GOING OVER ESTIMATES. I WILL LINK ALL WEBSITES AND INFO USED TO CALCULATE MY ESTIMATES IN DESCRIPTION AND PIN IT IN THE COMMENTS.**

**EPS ESTIMATE BY WALL ST. ANALYSTS IS $-0.07**

Net income = profit of business after deducting expenses

IF \_\_\_\_ IS NOT TRUE THEN MY ESTIMATES WILL 100% BE WAY OFF

**EVEN WITH ALL THIS SAID I DO NOT THINK I AM BEING OVERLY OR UNFAIRLY OPTIMISTIC IN ANY TIER RELATIVE TO THE LABEL (unfairly bearish, conservative, fair, optimistic, unfairly bullish)**

**5 estimates**

ONE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO ) UNFAIRLY BEARISH ESTIMATE)

$-15M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-15M (Net proceeds)

$-15M Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0979176186 or -10 cents

(MISSES EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.03)

(MISSES Q3 2020 BY $0.01)

(BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.17)

% CHANCE IMO -- 2%

TWO

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO)CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE)

$-7.9M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-7.9M (Net proceeds) $-7.9M Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0515699458 or -5 cents

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $.02)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $0.04)

BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.22)

% CHANCE IMO -- 10%

THREE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO)FAIR ESTIMATE)

$-5M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-5M (Net proceeds) $-5M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0326392062 or -3 cents

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.04)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $0.06)

(BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.24)

% CHANCE IMO -- 25%

FOUR

((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATE)

$-3M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-3M (Net proceeds) $-3M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0195835237 or -2 cents

(BEATS EPS ($-0.07) ESTIMATE BY $0.05)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $0.07)

(BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.25)

% CHANCE IMO -- 50%

FIVE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO) UNFAIRLY BULLISH ESTIMATE)

$2m (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $2M (Net proceeds) $2M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $0.0130556825 OR 1 Cent

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.08)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $.10)

BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.28)

% CHANCE IMO -- 13%

2019 Q4 EPS was $-0.27

2020 Q3 was $-0.09

VERY likely that BNGO has doubled revenue in Q4. This means that -

Net income = profit of business after deducting expenses

There is no way of knowing BNGO’s Net income in Q4 but looking historically at net income increases and movements and looking at yahoo finance’s TTM total expenses stat, I am assuming that it has not risen more than 5-20% (I am comparing to ¼ of 2019 total expenses according to yahoo finance)

2020 Q3 net income -$10.8M

Shares outstanding for 2020 Q4 is $153.19M

Net income - Preferred dividends = Net Proceeds/Shares Outstanding = EPS

Important factors I considered when estimating net incomes for each tier - Acquisition of Lineagen (was acquired August 24th 2020), Earnings date was not delayed, Big money has not been selling out (to our knowledge (retail investors information)) prior to earnings, **EVEN WITH ALL THIS SAID I DO NOT THINK I AM BEING OVERLY OR UNFAIRLY OPTIMISTIC IN ANY TIER RELATIVE TO THE LABEL (unfairly bearish, conservative, fair, optimistic, unfairly bullish**

**5 estimates**

**Likely Scenarios for each tier!!!**

REMEMBER I CAN BE WRONG ON ALL OF THIS, I could be looking too closely into something or missing something

I could have math miscalculations or missed data or false data

This is not financial advice

m9nswl,gro2g8k,StockMarket,comment,1616300105,"So there is something called dividends in investing. Dividends are where the company pays you in cash (or more shares) for owning shares if it’s company. You should buy some shares in a really strong company and set up a dividend reinvestment program. This is so your cash payments are delivered in more stock of the company. This way you accumulate more and more shares until each dividend payout from just owning the shares will be huge because you own a lot of shares. Then you can hold onto those shares for the rest of your life and get a hefty check from the company every 4 months for the rest of your life.

Btw not trying to talk down to you if you know this already. I just don’t know how experienced you are and I wanted to offer some advice.",
m9nswl,gro1kv9,StockMarket,comment,1616299569,"I should have been very very very careful when I started. My experience tells me to take small profits (10-50%) while they are available. Keep in mind that most of the time good things do not last. I have lost 8k+ by thinking “oh I will wait for this to hit the top. I don’t want to miss out on this insane gain.” There are 10s if thousands of people looking to profit on the same thing we are. A gain isn’t a gain and a loss isn’t a loss until you sell. I have benefitted off of diversifying my portfolio, namely with crypto. I do not put all of my eggs in one basket. The stock market is corrupt to the core and needs some fundamental change to give “the little guy” an advantage or even a fair chance. This is not financial advice, just my experience.

ma3co0,,StockMarket,post,1616352983,"DD Valuation of the Next Tesla: Grossly Undervalued bubble stock in the making (VOW, VWAGY)I'll split this DD valuation on Volkswagen into two parts: the Value Play and the Next Tesla Play.

VOW is the actual European stock ticker.  VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.

[Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales for 2020 and [Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/this-is-how-long-it-takes-to-become-an-ev-player-51616075163).

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020 for a [gross margin of 11.5%](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1).  As of March 19, its price-to-sales multiple is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60, despite not having the latter's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.  Their respective gross margins were [16.4%](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) and [4.6%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results).  They trade at similar price-to-sales multiples despite lacking Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues in 2020 €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, *should have already been worth at least €111.0 billion last year*.  [Deutsche Bank has recently stated that this particular business should already be worth €195.0 billion.](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/)  However, this is a conservative estimate, as the company has beaten its earlier EV unit sales targets, and again because EV are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles.

How much further should this EV-related market cap ""stonk""?

Well, [Volkswagen plans to sell 1 million EVs this very year!](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volkswagen-ev-goals-tesla-stock-51615901639)  If this is realistic, then the consumer EV sales could reach €23.95 billion.  Accordingly, the consumer EV business could be worth up to €479.1 billion.

**EV Economy Matters**

[The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, has big plans for fast charging and bidirectional charging.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/vw-plans-europe-s-biggest-battery-push-in-electric-offensive)

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $42 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should be €181.2 billion.

The EV top-up of €195.0 billion to €479.1 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €376.2 billion to €660.3 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been trading between $87.16 and $152.98 yesterday, folks!**

mbfm99,,wallstreetbets,post,1616508808,"Sir Isaac Newton secretly wrote about GME, and was a 💎🙌 💪🦍 who gave us a target share priceIsaac Newton is known as being one of the biggest smart smarts in history. 

But did you know he secretly wrote about the GME rocket ship in his work ""*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*"", 297 years before Gamestop was founded?

&#x200B;

That means ***he was even smarter than we thought***, and here's the proof:

&#x200B;

𝕹𝖊𝖜𝖙𝖔𝖓'𝖘 𝕷𝖆𝖜 𝖔𝖋 𝖀𝖓𝖎𝖛𝖊𝖗𝖘𝖆𝖑 𝕲𝖗𝖆𝖛𝖎𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓 (𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓐𝓹𝓮 𝓛𝓪𝔀)

Newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity, and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on Earth.

Looking at his equations, they assumed he was speaking of things like mass, radii, and acceleration: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

They took this to mean that the gravitational constant of Earth was 9.8 m/s² and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding Newton's work:

>gₑ = (6.67 \* 10⁻¹¹ N•m²/kg²)(6.0\*10²⁴ kg(/(6.4\*10⁶m)²  
>  
>gₑ = 9.8 m/s²

&#x200B;

However, while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics, it was WRONG, and they were actually 𝕭𝖎𝖌 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇𝖘 who misunderstood what Newton was saying.

To understand what he really meant by the equation: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

We have to do a bit of re-arranging, because he didn't want his secret code to be found out too easily:

>GMₑ= gₑ \* Rₑ²

&#x200B;

Next, we have to change the little ""ₑ's and g's"" to big ""E's and G's"" since Newton wasn't a small minded hedgie:

>GME = GE \* RE²

&#x200B;

See what that says??? [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/)

&#x200B;

Newton's target price for GME was the price of GE, multiplied by the squared price of Everest Re Group Ltd (Ticker: RE).

&#x200B;

That gives us a target price for GME of:

>GME = $13.01 \*  $243.29²  
>  
>***GME = $770,062***

&#x200B;

So there you have it, Newton's secret code has been given to us. 

&#x200B;

His Law of Universal Gravitation was never about forces that would pull things down to Earth, it was about things that would rocket past the moon  [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

mbg2t5,,wallstreetbets,post,1616510118,"How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire (2nd Edition)*Preface: I previously posted this using my main account on WallStreetBets. However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*

&#x200B;

So, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.

Fear.

Slowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!

&#x200B;

*""What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?""*

This guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.

&#x200B;

*""Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?""*

Great question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.

So, without further ado, let us begin.

\-----

# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival

Chapter 1

Protecting it from everyone else

&#x200B;

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, “look at Moneybags over here”, “must be nice”, or “remember the little guy”, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You’ll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)

On top of that, they’re gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.

They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

By that point, you’ve lost. You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, “no”. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

There's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can’t take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.

*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Protecting it from expenses

&#x200B;

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Protecting it from yourself

&#x200B;

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

\-----

# Part 2 - Economic Survival

Chapter 1

Taxes

&#x200B;

Roughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective ""*ouch*"" from everyone reading.

That's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!

With that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Debt

&#x200B;

If you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.

Now, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

FIRE

&#x200B;

FIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.

Now, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.

This would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:

* **Lean FIRE** \- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year
* **Fat FIRE** \- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)
* **Barista FIRE** \- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.
* **Coast FIRE** \- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Investments

&#x200B;

Before I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...

I believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*

**Stock Market** \- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.

**Real Estate** \- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.

**Businesses** \- ""Small business is the backbone of our economy."" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.

\-----

# Part 3 - What Comes Next?

Chapter 1

Spending

&#x200B;

Alright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Building a cabinet

&#x200B;

Now, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Giving

&#x200B;

And now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.

&#x200B;

Chapter 4

Sources for you to perform your own Due Diligence

&#x200B;

In this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!

[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.

*Graham Stephan - YouTube* *:* Graham Stephan is a self-made millionaire who achieved financial independence in his 20's. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)

*Dave Ramsey Show - YouTube* *:* A religious millionaire who hosts a radio show revolving around teaching people how to get out of debt and take control of their personal finances to become (and stay) millionaires.

[Windfall - r/personalfinance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) \- Lots of good resources on advice for people who receive windfalls.

\-----

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***""The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.""***

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

Oh who am I kidding. You're the apes on Wall Street! You will all be fine. Just be careful, my friends. As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life.",

mbkb9h,,wallstreetbets,post,1616521599,"Gamestop Can Only Go Up&#x200B;

Technical Analysis doesn't mean too much to GME, but it certainly tells us something. I think most of us here can agree that something could certainly happen due to the insanely low volume we have been seeing as well as the Earnings Report coming later today. Here are some a few key indicators why GME can and will go up dramatically soon.

&#x200B;

[1 Hour Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/007anng09to61.jpg?width=1895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aff7be90f38ab719c4288d31a1ff33f04b32cd8f)

&#x200B;

1. **RSI -** The first point I'd like to touch on is RSI. As you can see, the RSI is extremely overbought in the bottom left of the chart when GME was making it's comeback from the drop to $40. Now look at the RSI **AT THE SAME PRICE** today and you'll see that we are heading towards being oversold. What does this mean? It's simply an indicator that we are oversold and due a huge price increase.
2. **Trend -** In terms of the month, we have seen insane gains from the $40 price point we were sitting at for weeks. From the start of this chart to the end you can see an upward trend. Now if you look at the first pennant formation indicated by the white lines in the red highlighted area, it's starting to look awful familiar to the current correction we are seeing in the second red highlighted area. The current trend we are in is a Bullish Descending Triangle, much like the Pennant we saw earlier.
3. **Volume -** With GME, when volume goes up, price goes up. If you look at the volume you can see that whenever it dries up, the price tends to skyrocket. Right now volume is extremely low, a sign that people are holding strong and shorters are having a difficult time dropping the price further.
4. **Turning Point -** With the RSI, Trend, and Volume all pointing towards future rapid growth, I'm inclined to believe we will see massive gains soon. I do not see the price dropping below $150 at this point, and the only way I see it getting to that area is MASSIVE short selling to artificially drop the price.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** The technicals point toward GME skyrocketing in the near future. Take this all with a grain of salt though, the price could very well drop below the areas I've mentioned before going up. Above all else **HODL** and the tendies shall come!",

mb72z0,,wallstreetbets,post,1616475590,"FINRA Reporting Inaccurate Total Trade VolumeI used Fintel to gauge the short interest of any given stock because I thought they were reliable. However, with the latest round of orchestrated ""flash crashes"" being done on meme stocks, and Fintel actually reporting lower ""Short Volume Ratio"" afterwards, I set out to find out just what the hell is going on.

Turns out, Fintel gets their Short Volume figure from FINRA's [Daily Short Sale Volume Files](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). Through that webpage, you can find short volume data for any stock for any given day. For example, today 2021-03-22, FINRA maintains that GME had a **short volume of 2,358,752** with a **total volume of 3,843,634**. And according to FINRA, Total Volume is defined as ""**share volume of all executed trades during regular trading hours**.""

Alright, that's cool and all but what is wrong? Well, the problem is the Total Volume figure reported by FINRA is completely off and the fact that services like Fintel uses FINRA's short volume data to calculate short volume ratio presents inaccurate data to the public.

For example, Fintel is currently reporting a **23%** Short Volume Ratio for GME as of 2021-03-22. The way they calculate Short Volume Ratio is simply take the Short Volume figure from FINRA (**2,358,752**) divided by the Total Volume. Whao, but Fintel is showing **10,054,700** as the Total Volume for GME, what?

[Fintel uses the Short Volume figure from FINRA. Example: 2021-03-22, Short Volume for GME: 2,358,752. However, Fintel disagrees with FINRA in that Fintel uses 10,054,700 as the total volume whereas FINRA maintains GME only had 3,843,634 total volume.](https://preview.redd.it/5g4lhepc7po61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f5c94c82d5a01181d73667ebeeb7feed416e25e)

Okay, let see then..

[ Yahoo Finance shows GME had a volume of 9,573,686 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/m3483d888po61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=401ab28bc0b80a29c43d0ec4d358566bb035dae3)

[ WeBull shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/8v5abi8g8po61.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2cab05661faa8c6c1d132baa7eae18f7ebf79b)

[ Robinhood shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/fp0t9tkn8po61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3eacd125e70226892e147187be9189558a4084)

[ Fidelity shows GME had a volume of 10,061,505 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/nrkys7cv8po61.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee32b3251553ab514d1835f9fa0b540e5d9bb27)

You get the picture. Four sources confirmed that GME had a total volume of \~10M on 2021-03-22. Why the hell is FINRA reporting only 3.8M as the total volume? YES, I am aware that FINRA breaks down their report by markets. I specifically did the analysis based on their ""consolidated"" data across markets B *(NASDAQ TRF Chicago)*, Q *(NASDAQ TRF Carteret)* and N *(NYSE TRF)* So, what the hell?

Once I start questioning that, I had to check FINRA's short volume report for a longer time span for GME. Turns out, FINRA has been under-reporting total volume for all tickers since.. ever. Here I compare what FINRA is reporting vs what Yahoo and Fidelity are reporting. (Blue: FINRA, Red: Yahoo and Yellow: Fidelity)

[ GME Total Trading Volume as reported by FINRA, Yahoo & Fidelity \(2021-01-01 to 2021-03-22\) \[Check sources below raw data\]](https://preview.redd.it/wj18e4vpcpo61.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf1121443100b84f7e78e92b7c9c9ceafe96f44)

As you can see, Yahoo and Fidelity pretty much align 100% on what the total volume is, but FINRA ***\_never\_*** reported even remotely close to what others are reporting. Again, keep in mind the FINRA data I used in this analysis is consolidated across markets.

The ramification of using FINRA's short volume and the total volume of what everyone else is reporting is underestimating the short volume ratio. If we go by the total volume reported by FINRA, we actually get 2358752 / 3843634= **61.4%** Short Volume Ratio. However, sites like Fintel uses that 2358752 short volume figure and the total volume \~10M figure, that gives a low **23%** Short Volume Ratio. The difference is dramatic.

**The questions that need to be answered are: what is FINRA reporting? Why do the total volume they report so different than everybody else's? How confident and reliable are their Short Volume data then? If their consolidated data turns out to be not consolidated, are they deceiving the public in that services like Fintel report a fraction of the real Short Volume Ratio as a result?**

For the record, I did check other stocks *(blue chips, meme stocks, EV.. etc.)* FINRA ***\_always\_*** under-report the total volume.

&#x200B;

**EDIT TO ADD:**

[Fintel's definition on short volume.](https://preview.redd.it/8mhntjpp4to61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7285ff634d1f16e313ec990ddc9989509c01f)

Fintel takes the Short Volume figure from FINRA at face value and divided it by a number (total volume) that includes more markets than FINRA does. *(FINRA's total volume reported does not include or align with exchange volume and they only count trades that are ""publicly disseminated"")*

In the end, we learn that the data from FINRA is not complete *(perhaps there will never be a single source of truth when it comes to market data.)* and should not be taken at face value. You can use it to maybe gauge market direction, but it can not be used to accurately calculate the short volume ratio. *(Since, well.. both the numerator and denominator are subsets of the whole population. It is sampling at best. And sampling is well, sampling. It is not meant to be 100% accurate.)*

&#x200B;

TL;DR: FINRA allegedly report ~~inaccurate~~ **incomplete** total volume in their Short Sale Volume daily report and services like Fintel uses them and as a result gives **inaccurate** short volume ratio.

Here’s a bit from the intro, seems the bit about “publicly-disseminated” is doing a lot of work?: “FINRA believes that the following three key points about the short sale volume data may help market participants better understand and draw informed conclusions about the data. As discussed below, the data: (1) does not include any trades that are not publicly disseminated, (2) is not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does not—and is not intended to—equate to short interest position information.” https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)

# TL;DR

Think like a customer. Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.

Walk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?

When you’ve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.

# Purpose

Disclaimer: Don’t use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!

Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**
* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# First Phase: Real Estate

Walk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?

https://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8

Ultimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf

The reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.

&#x200B;

# Second Phase: Customer Service

You as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey’s targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.

Ask yourself:

\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?

\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?

\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?

– Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?

\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?

\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?

# Summary

Despite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the “custom” in customer.

mb585a,grwc6u1,wallstreetbets,comment,1616476700,"I recently shopped at gamestop, went in there with a blank slate and I am not much of a gamer. 

What I love:

. Staff knew what they were talking about when it came 
to games

. Customer Service was excellent and I felt that I was treated right

. They had clothing that I was really tempted to buy because it looked cool and it was cheap

What they can improve upon:

. Store looks old. I saw the leak of the new gamestop and it looks alot better. 

. They should have a Amazon-like lockers for pickups. Use the app to provide the a code to open up the locker. I say this because I want to get in and out of the store

. Have staff use tablets with credit card reader to help customers whom wait in line

The idea is to make the customer to have a frictionless experience and waiting in line sucks. Imagine that during a major release. That being said, I expected to spend 20 dollars in the store, but I ended up spending 80. Got myself the new Monster Hunter:Rise and the pro membership.",['AMZN']

I asked them if they knew the different specs between an XBOX or a PS5. I asked of they thought the guy at Wal-Mart or Target knew. I asked if they thought the guy as Best Buy would know. Then I asked about GameStop and the point was clear. The only store that would come close to the dedicated knowledge was Best Buy but it the layouts and size make Best Buy feel more ""intimidating"".

So what does GME need to do to exploit their role as the best small to medium footprint gaming retailer?

My first step is heavy on exclusives. Promotions with Pokemon cards and Magic cards. Promotions for exclusive in game content like they have done with Fortnite. Like all the time. Geolocked content that gets released at GameStop like Legendary Pokemon in various Pokemon games. Exclusive merch like Amibos. Definitely need some exclusive Funko Pops for those degenerates. Exclusive premium launch bundles.

Essentially, get stuff that gamers from all corners of fandom want and can only find at GameStop. Making GameStop part of peoples gaming habit can be done if they want to do it.",['BBY']

maxt80,,wallstreetbets,post,1616446716,"GME: Poker, cannibalism, and why the apes are going to win this hand.I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Listen up, apes.  I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen.  Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it.  Now, I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal, or really anything with meaningful content, so let's just talk about card games.

How do casinos make money on poker?  For each hand of poker played, the casino takes a small percentage of the pot, which is called the rake.  The casino provides the establishment and the dealers, the players play, and the casino takes its commission.  Okay, great, but what the fuck does this have to do with GME?  We're getting there.  Hang on.  The edging is real, but you'll get your payoff.

So the casino takes its cut from each pot.  The more money in the pot, the more money the casino makes.  Great.  How do they maximize profits?  Well, they can bring in more players, get players to play longer, deal more hands per hour, and/or increase the average size of the pots.  I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these, because it doesn't matter.  What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains.  The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money, you just need to understand their business model.

Let's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots.  There are tons of ways to do this, but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino, you're at a local back-alley gambling spot.   Their operation isn't super sophisticated.  They just install a few of their cronys into each game.  Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals: bring people in, loosen up the tables, and create big pots.   As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table (and lose it), the house will profit.

There's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet.  No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money, right?  Well, that's not entirely true.  In fact, it's not at all true.  Then why the fuck did I mention it?  Well, you tell me, why the fuck would you play a rigged game?

Even if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham, if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth, they will still play.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  In fact, it's even a good thing for the house when ""dumb money"" make money; this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends.  They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently.

The house wants you to play.  The house wants your friends to play.  The house wants everyone to play.  So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play?  Did you fucking read the last paragraph?  It's simple: you make it the best way for anyone to make money.  You essentially force them to play.  Don't get lost in the details.   It doesn't matter how this is accomplished.  They can lick you, suck you, fuck you, beat you, squeeze you, whack the other competition off, etc.  All that matters is that whatever game they run, it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery.

So what happens when players make too much money?  I don't know, what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code?  What happens when the sheep start misbehaving?  A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep, but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame.  Again, the game is rigged, and  the minions have one fucking job: follow the script and don't get too greedy.  Any problem, and I mean any problem, is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood.  

Reddit is an enormous echo chamber.  Shit gets loud in here, but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME, most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big, they're not going to care.  They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery.

So what the hell am I actually saying about GME?  The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused, but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand.  There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some ""Epsteins,"" but as long as the apes don't fold, the apes win this round.  If the mobsters play this game right, they'll fold this hand, take their losses, and (as usual) end up winning in the long run.  They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff.  This is EZ mode.

Do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine?  It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family, a bigly minion, or even the fucking godfather.  You live by the sword, you die by the sword.  When you have an infected limb, you first try to treat it, but if that doesn't work, you cut that shit off.  These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own--I'm sure that some of them even prefer it.  The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder, and the cannibals are going to feast.

TL;DR Read the fucking post.  It took me way longer to write than it will take (most of) you to read it.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

But here’s some background:

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). ""DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays"".
2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global DDIC manufacturer in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

If I use my body as an example, my brain tells my body what to do, but without my spinal cord, I'm useless.

* Brain = Processor
* Body = Display
* DDIC = Spinal Cord

# History

1. **MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-surpasses-the-500-million-milestone-in-cumulative-shipments-of-display-driver-ics-for-oled-screens-300891577.html)

What is OLED? OLED is the next generation of screens.

* TV went from Tube - LCD - LED
* Phones are going from LCD - OLED

1. **The issue was, MX was so early to the game (in 2003) that no one was ready for OLED. Smartphones didn't even exist yet. So while MX kept producing other products such as DDIC for LCD, MX kept preparing and developing their baby, knowing that the secret sauce was in the OLED.**

# So what has changed? 5G AND OLED!

1. **As you all know, 5G is going to become the norm within the next 2-3 years.**

If you have been living under a rock, 5G is the next generation in cellular connectivity, 100x faster which is going to open all sorts of opportunities for the world.

When phone manufacturers introduce the new ""latest and greatest"", you can't give a phone with 5G lightning speeds but not upgrade everything else! So manufacturers upgrade other parts of the phone to continuously justify the price point.

2. **Manufacturers need to add things like:**

* Better/slimmer designs
* Faster processors
* New Colors
* But most obviously, better quality screens.

Screens have become more important especially with the rise of the mobile gaming industry. Reports estimate that by the end of 2020, mobile game revenue will hit $76.7 billion, more than the film and music industry combined. - [source](https://www.ironsrc.com/blog/top-51-mobile-app-and-gaming-statistics/). We all know you can't be playing Fortnite or watch Youtube while looking at a potato screen.

# Connecting MX and the rise of 5G

MX has been waiting 18 years for this day to come.

* **MX has recently launched their new DDIC product lines which feature** **a 28nm OLED DDIC (down from 40nm) = smaller thinner phone. The DDIC's also feature -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-launches-28-nanometer-oled-ddic-for-smartphone-displays-300831906.html)
* 120hz High Frame Rate (HFR) = smoother picture, especially for gaming.
* compatibility with various display types = rigid, flexible, foldable, VR/AR
* reduction in power voltage from 1.1v to 1.0 = reducing power consumption by more than 20% and extending battery life
* reduction in Electromagnetic Interference by 20% = clearer phone calls
* support for Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) displays = more power efficient backplane = extending battery life

https://preview.redd.it/sdbr7vzuqso61.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab9c244e170feb1f49ac66a3506693470c7d93b

**In addition, the 28nm OLED DDIC are going to be made in 300mm fabs (factories) = greater profit margin**

* Chips are made in fabs, usually on 200 or 300mm wafers. - [source](http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/CEICM/SECTION7.pdf)
* 200mm wafers was technology introduced in 1992,
* This is similar to trying to boil 1 million eggs in a medium sized saucepan.
* In addition, the saucepan is old and it's possible that the eggs might get cracked = lower yield/lower margins.
* 300mm wafers are the new standard in making chip making 1 million eggs in a shiny large pot (which has a lower chance of eggs getting cracked) = higher yield/ higher margin

# OLEDs are booming:

https://preview.redd.it/ga8351tvqso61.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=522d1d40be7e52d5b2e4497fecd471292e708f7e

# A few last things... (if you get this innuendo, good job):

1. A Korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want

* OLED Screen
* 120hz HFR
* LPTO Displays

1. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)
2. OLED is here, gaming console usage could become a very large upside opportunity. The Nintendo Switch (upcoming) will have a OLED display (albeit a lower end one, called rigid OLED compared to ones in iPhones)

https://preview.redd.it/f7s8adazqso61.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa3b33956770f31b44024ba6c62ee4dbfeea917d

4. **MX is also rumored to be for sale as mentioned earlier** [**https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=205435**](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=205435)

5. AND some frigid weather knocked out Samsung's Austin plant that makes OLED DDICs for Apple  (still shut down as of two weeks ago [source](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/03/10/samsungs-austin-fab-still-shut-down-weeks-after-texas-freeze/6924766002/)). Do you think Apple wants to have all its eggs in one basket going forward?

# Valuation

**Despite a nice run in YTD 2021, MX is still dirt cheap, trading at 8-9x Adj. 2021 EBITDA, which is dirt cheap for a high growth technology stonk.**

**Competitor in the space and recent acquisitions have been at much higher multiples.**

https://preview.redd.it/ijqc7681rso61.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=997b93bff21a09fc00876b3af44462640137a145

# What does the current returns projections look like?

https://preview.redd.it/1tbnj8v2rso61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=574252d80a8f08002e5936f3d15cc14a081d164b

**I think the company will easily hit $65-70mm EBITDA in 2021 and rerate to a higher EV multiple, in line with competitors who are valued at a 25x-35x EV/EBITDA multiple: 100% upside. Longer term, as OLEd gains further traction and takes share from LCD and penetrates into TV, automotive, and gaming smartphones, 2023 EBITDA could grow to well north of $150mm with MX worth potentially 10x its current market cap.**

For anyone who wants to know more about Aphria's history, I suggest you guys read those posts first because I won't repeat earlier points I've made.

# Introduction

Okay retards, I lied. I said my previous post would be my last before merger, but with recent developments I could not help but make another post. My last post was also pretty badly timed for anyone looking to hold until merger, price was around $23.7 then. The price did go up to about $32 in the next few days so you could have also made a huge profit if you sold on the way up. But I advised you guys to hold until merger so I might have involuntarily created some bagholders with my last post, for which I'm sorry. To those who are holding through losses, don't despair. Aphria has a bright future ahead with the Tilray merger now in its final stage. That's what I'll be talking about in this post, so anyone interested please read.

# Merger finalizing: arbitrage opportunity largely vanished

For anyone who doesn't know, on April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting where they'll vote on the merger and on April 16th Tilray will do the same for their shareholders. This was announced about a week ago. Both companies cooperated in making a website for their shareholders on [www.aphriatilraytogether.com](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com) with all the information you could possibly need. I especially recommend the Investors and FAQ sections. I know you guys are lazy fucks so I will summarize the most important info in bullet points:

* **On April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting at 4 pm EST on** [**www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021**](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)**. However, only registered shareholders can ask questions and vote on the merger. We can attend as guests if we fill out an online form.** Only shareholders with a significant position are registered. Most of us retail traders hold shares through an intermediary (brokers) so we can't vote unless the intermediary gives us notice. 
* **Both boards are unanimously in favor of the merger and are encouraging shareholders to vote FOR the merger.** Major shareholders will follow the board's advice. So sit back and relax, this merger thing will go through.
* **Each holder of Aphria shares will receive 0.8381 of a Tilray Share for each Aphria Share. There will be no fractional Tilray shares.** I'll clarify this with a numerical example. I have 30 shares of Aphria, so I should receive 0.8381\*30 = 25.14 Tilray shares. But there are no fractional shares, so I round down to the nearest whole number: I will receive 25 Tilray shares on merger date. The transaction should go through without any additional costs or taxes.
* **Often mergers go through about a month after shareholders voted on it. Following this logic,**   
**a potential merger date should be sometime in the middle of May.** I should say that this is not all at confirmed by either Aphria and Tilray, but it is just based on common practice. The exact merger date will probably be announced a week beforehand.

In my previous posts I always underlined that there was a small chance that the merger doesn't go through or that the merger split would be changed. Those two chances have both become 0% since the announcement of the meetings and creation of that website. This is why the arbitrage opportunity that I also highlighted in my last two posts has largely disappeared. 

Currently Aphria is noted at $18.53 and Tilray at $23.56, which makes the split 0.7865 so the difference to the merger split has almost disappeared at a 0.0516 margin. This is probably due to big players on the stock market noticing and closing the gap. You can still buy in right now with a small benefit, but it's no longer a big lucrative play. Anyone still looking to buy in should just do it for the merger and the positive future of the cannabis market globally.

**TLDR:** Last week Aphria and Tilray confirmed their merger with upcoming shareholder meetings and an informative website ([AphriaTilrayTogether](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com)). Voting on the merger is finalized after the meetings on April 14th and 16th. Shareholders will surely vote in favor of the merger, so the potential merger date should be somewhere in the middle of May (not confirmed). Arbitrage opportunity is now almost fully gone.

**Position:** Nothing changed, my 30 shares @ $8.74 are still standing strong.","['PM', 'GPS']"

maoxrc,,wallstreetbets,post,1616423438,"The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market Makers**The real ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ has some thoughts about the stock market:** 

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

What is Payment for Order Flow? [Investopedia Article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp)

>..payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp)—the same Madoff of Ponzi scheme notoriety.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, in a [special study](https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ordpay.htm) on PFOF published in December 2000, “Payment for order flow is a method of transferring some of the trading profits from market making to the brokers that route customer orders to specialists for execution.” Payment for order flow (PFOF) is the compensation a broker receives for routing trades for trade execution.

Description/Profile from Yahoo Fin below for anyone unaware:

*Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer in the United States. The company sells a range of sporting and outdoor recreation products, including sporting equipment, apparel, footwear, camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor cooking equipment, and hunting and fishing gears primarily under the Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, and Outdoor Gourmet brand names. As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website.*

&#x200B;

* **Academy financials:** *I've opted to use Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as the industry benchmark here - not perfect, but similar enough to help understand the relative financial health of ASO compared to the market leader*
   * Market Cap: 2.25B (*DKS 7B*)
   * Trailing P/E: 9.31 (*DKS 13.83*)
   * Operating Cash Flow (ttm): 1.03B (*DKS 1.55B)*
   * Current Ratio (liquidity): 1.61 *(DKS 1.47) - for folks who don't look at the balance sheet too often, current ratio is the comparison of current assets to current liabilities. Higher number typically indicates that you have a healthy balance of assets/liabilities - though too high could mean you aren't taking enough risk or appropriately levered.*
   * **Q3 2020 Earnings:** Q3 2020 sales were up 18% vs prior year. **Think about Q3 2020 -** most of the country still in lockdown, tensions rising and people flocked to these stores as a materialism escape OR to ready their defenses. Gross margin of 33% which was up 110 bps over previous year in the middle of the pandemic - great control of costs.
* **Dick's Measuring**: One area I think a lot of people are missing when comparing to Dick's ($DKS) is that, while ASO is more niche and not yet as widely recognized, the sales per store is significantly higher due to the fanaticism and mix of goods sold here. As ASO continues expanding (currently only in 16 states!), Revenue will catch up to DKS quickly and the increase in scale will improve margins:
   * ASO: 260 stores with 5.5 B in Revenue (ttm) = **21M per store**
   * DKS: 850 stores with 8.7 B in Rev = **10.2M per store**
   * This tells me that either **Academy is doing a better job in how they select the physical locations for their stores, or they have a stronger mix of online to brick and mortar sales than DKS**
* **Public Listing Fuel**: To me, ASO has significant upside - that being said, the stock price has essentially doubled since its listing as shorts continue to double down. ASO has an excellent opportunity to utilize this price growth as fuel for expansion. Currently, only about 1/3 of their total shares outstanding are considered floating shares, most likely due to the post-IPO lock-down  (more to come on this in the ""what scares me section"" below).
   * At this point about 8% of shares are held by insiders vs 4% for DKS. This is a good sign to me and a vote of confidence in upward movement, but will be keeping an eye on this figure after the lock-out period expires.
* **Guns and Butter**: Sure, we can make the argument that gun/ammo sales are through the roof - an area that ASO plays in that DKS does not. For me, this offers more of a short term benefit than anything - a potential catalyst for stronger than expected earnings however not sure we can hang our hopes and dreams on everyone in America buying a small arsenal.

&#x200B;

* Here is what scares me:
   * ASO has only recently become public. A few stray assumptions can cause turmoil down the road as the steady state of the business becomes clear.
   * On top of this, the ""lock out"" period for company insiders expires at the end of this month - they have also placed their Q4 earnings the day before this lock-out expires. Read into that as you will.
   * Of course, on top of all of this, the company itself needs to be managed well from the top. They have made a few recent notable personnel moves (Tom Nealson from Southwest Airlines appointed to board), however I know little about the track record or competence of the leadership at Academy.

I find this bet so strange.  The only reason you go into it is because you think there's a real strong chance of the stock ending the week above $13, right?

Like, yeah, this bet does a little better than the debit spread if the stock falls only slightly, but at the price of so much of the upside.  Basically the stock would need to hit $16 before you started making more money with this play than the debit spread.

Or, to put it another way, you coulda just bought 11-12 debit spreads for 62 cents a pop.  With those you'd actually make more profit with AMC ending the week at $12 as you would with your play and AMC ending the week at $14.",

I'll briefly touch on some financial aspects (will try to include as little technicalities as possible - we won't be making our own DCF/EVA/Multiple Valuation, calculating a WACC and levering and de-levering betas here but there'll be some numbers - soz).

Mainly I want to touch on the misconception that Palantir is not profitable and that they're losing more and more money year by year. I'll try to show why Aunt Cathie, Vanguard and Soros Fund Management aren't actually high.

>*ThEy'Ve BeEn ArOuNd FoR 17 YeArS aNd ArE sTiLl NoT pRoFiTaBlE*

Buckle up boomer.

Before we get to that I want to briefly discuss the current market environment and the potential for further dips (potentially even dips of dips of dips a.k.a. megadips) in the near future as to inform some of you newer YOLOers about what this whole 10 YR Treasury Yield shit is all about and why you should care. It might potentially save you some money. If you're familiar with the inverse correlation of growth stock prices and the treasury yields/inflation expectations, just skip ahead.

At the end I'd like to compare PLTR's current situation with industry peers and compare their forecasted developments.

# Valuation of Growth Stocks & 10 YR Treasury Yield

Now why is Palantir dipping more than other tech stocks like Apple or Google? Was it just a pump and dump? Are people leaving? To answer that question we'll have to look at how people valuate companies. The most widely used method is the Discounted Cash Flow method. In simplified terms you look at a company's future cash flows, discount them at some interest rate, add some fancy terminal value and what not (don't worry about that) and you end up with the current company's valuation.

[This is a simplified version of the DCF valuation - you can get all fancy with this](https://preview.redd.it/vkpao2965no61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=1888f4c171b6a8dea8bd03574556e9c7d8299d39)

Now when treasury rates rise - the discount rate (r) rises - your Cashflow gets smaller. The further out in the future your cashflows are - the more you're affected by rising interest rates. Hence why companies with valuations based on cashflows that are far out are more strongly affected by those rising rates. The big Cash Flows are a few years out and are being discounted at (1+r) \^ many years.

Below you'll see how MSFT, GOOGL & AAPL's market caps are a lot less affected than newer companies such as Tesla (moderately new), PLTR and Snowflake - they're all ""tech"" stocks but tech  **≠** same growth expectations for all tech companies.

[Inverse Correlation between Growth Stocks & Treasury Yields](https://preview.redd.it/kzn6lnyd7no61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f12416a459f10e1c0751111d9d1172835e38d2)

**TLDR**: If treasury yields continue to rise we might see growth stock prices go even lower due to people valuating these stocks at a lower price due to the increasing discount rate (r). That's just a little disclaimer I wanted to get out of the way - the macroeconomic environment matters a whole lot for these stocks.

Now let's get to the sawwssee

# PLTR Revenue Expectations vs. Peers

Some numbers incoming - bear with me it'll get better.

So this one's pretty straightforward. Palantir increased their revenues by 47% between FY 2019 and FY 2020. The revenues from government operations in 2018 accounted for 43% (255m $) of total revenues, commercial revenue accounted for 57% (340m $) - In 2020 Government revenues accounted for 56% (610m $), commercial revenues accounted for 44% (482.5m $) of total revenues.

So many numbers I know - hold on. Between 2018 and 2020 PLTR had a roughly 150% increase in government revenues and a roughly 40% increase in commercial revenues. Now the good news - we're not even close to being done yet.

Here's a quick take (copy pasta from a  [previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4b3b/pltr_analyst_ratings_fud_bad_faith_and_abusing/)  I made) on the potential growth of government revenues going forward:

>If they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first private company to ever get that [level of clearance](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/27/2312271-1611785323344723_origin.png). That could attract other governments' military organisations like the UK, France, Germany etc. (assuming a cooperation with US allies is possible and doesn't jeopardize their current contracts with the US Military).

So [Palantir state](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-47-for-Full-Year-2020-Expects-Q1-2021-Revenue-Growth-of-45) that they're expecting **AT LEAST** 30% YoY growth in FY 2021 and I don't expect Papa Karp to underdeliver. Analysts predict a 40% increase. Now what's even more interesting is that actual profit metrics (EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income) are expected to grow from roughly 50% - 70% respectively - Palantir is going to be profitable very soon (they actually already are - or close to being profitable at least, but more on that later).

[Analyst Forecasts for profitability \/ growth metrics](https://preview.redd.it/5zrjp184hno61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=40a8ac792091fabc1437d07b71a1111321edbf01)

Now you might say ""the price targets are completely off - why trust these analysts when it comes to financial forecasts"" - truth be told, the forecasts on KPIs were a lot more accurate than the PTs. Although they were off by a mile on some of the KPIs (predicted a Net Income of 124 when it was actually 197, I've noticed that analysts have always underestimated those metrics with Palantir - so the following figures might actually end up being a low-ball estimate/bear case) - the mean prediction of revenues was 1072 vs. 1093 actual revenues, so that's pretty accurate.

[Pretty accurate mean revenue estimate - GJ](https://preview.redd.it/vlbdhrnqrno61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a26d86c0ceb917476c0f6a9c760bfa32d688915)

# Profitability

Okay - now to Palantir's profitability. I want to dismiss the following kind of comments and have you apes understand why PLTR is Soros Fund Management LLC's 2nd largest position, why it accounts for 21% of Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC's portfolio, why Vanguard is literally just telling Papa Karp to take their money, why Aunt Cathie is all over this stock.

[Stock based compensation 5xed in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 - that's what happens when you IPO](https://preview.redd.it/06msu3oukno61.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0354cc01aa4b5ec4baad220cc0cb7d61aa6177b)

So look at Datadog, Snowflake, Dynatrace, they all IPO'd between 2019 and 2020. You see how the stock based compensation accounts for a huge chunk of their net loss (Datadog's Stock Price Compensation was 74M$ vs. 24.5M$ net loss - substract that from the net loss and they're actually up 50M$)? That's not the case for mature companies like Adobe -  why's that? u/ugh_stupidpeople explains that pretty nicely [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/ll646o/stock_based_compensation/gnnm3fx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The gist is that employees get a a percentage of their salaries payed out as shares, when they IPO the following happens (in the PLTR case):

>The higher PLTR's stock price goes, the more its stock-based compensation numbers reported in earnings will increase, until pre-IPO compensation agreements expire. That's because the quantity of shares they're paying their employees was fixed pre-IPO. Higher price x same # of shares = higher cost reported. This will end as those pre-IPO compensation agreements expire.  
>  
>If Palantir's stock hadn't tripled since going public, their stock-based comp numbers would be much lower.  
>  
>\- u/ugh_stupidpeople

All else staying constant - if Palantir had the same Stock Based Compensation as they reported 2019 a.k.a. if they hadn't IPOed - they'd have an adjusted net loss of around 140 mio as opposed to the reported 1.166B$. If you deduct the 241m $ from the reported net loss of 579m $ (= 338m $), the adj. net loss would've been half that, in other words their net income would've increased by 50% not decreased by 100%. Deduct all costs that don't actually affect the operational activities of PLTR (First figure in the revenue section) you actually end up with a positive net income of 197.15M$ - Surprise, Palantir's operational activities are actually profitable, it's just the whole finance overhead (also strategical tax reasons) dragging the reported Net Income down.

>""BuT YoU'rE JuSt TwIsTiNg ThE NuMbeRs To MaKe It LoOk GoOd""

If that's what you're thinking right now, ask yourself if that ""expense"" actually reflects the companies' operational profitability - did it destroy value in any way, is the increasing net loss attributable to bad leadership and a shitty product? It's clearly not. It's just screwing us - the shareholders over in the short run - employees have gotten a disproportionate amount of shares (could Papa Karp have expected the share price to 4x - high of 38$ - or even 3x - current levels - from its IPO valuation in a matter of weeks? Doubt). Those employees are dumping those shares at every fucking spike.

I suspect that's one of the reasons behind Papa Karp's infamous quote ""Fuck off if you're here for the short term gains - we'll be dumping our shares because we're tired of eating ramen every fucking night"".

Remember how the price sky-rocketed to 40ish $ and came crashing down back to the 20s - a big part of that was the lock-in expiring a.k.a. employees cashing in at the top (They actually bought low and sold high, not like some of you apes). This all ends in max. 5 years - the dumping will be a lot less significant though as time goes by - when the pre-IPO Stock Based Compensations will have expired and the employees will be getting a less disproportionate amount of shares in relation to the current market price.

Now the good news is: These stock based compensations are expected to half by next year (see picture above), the profitability margins are expected to rise and the overall numbers are expected to grow - Palantir should be reporting around 320m $ + Net Income and in 5 years those pre-IPO stock compensation agreements will all have expired.

# Some blabber about CoGs, scalability and R&D expenditures (based on 3rd picture - Analyst Forecasts, I'm not gonna label the figures with Fig. 1 etc., we're still just on Reddit)

The CoGs (Cost of Goods Sold) are expected to stay more or less constant - that's in line with what Papa Karp always said. Palantir's services/products are organised in a way that they can be deployed to more customers without having to spend an amount proportionate to their revenue growth - don't ask me how, I'm not a fucking engineer, check the DD I linked at the bottom of the post if you're into those technicalities. Same goes for companies like Amazon AWS - double the amount of customers, get another server and maybe hire 10% more employees (I don't know the exact figures, as I said, I'm not a fucking engineer but you get the point).

R&D expenditures will grow by 40% and 20% in FY 2021 and FY 2022 respectively - I like to see that, that means they're investing to create a more competitive product. Consider they've had a pretty hostile relationship with IBM until IBM eventually gave up and partnered with PLTR - now imagine those Apollo/Foundry/Gotham testicles growing even larger.

# Peer Analysis

Now this all sounds pretty nice, is Palantir just giga special, one of a kind? No - the data analytics/data management - basically everything that has to do with data industry is growing like there's no tomorrow. Here a few quotes to highlight that (actual scientific literature - I know my brain hurts too, we're done soon):

>The size of the digital universe was roughly 130 billion gigabytes in 1995. By 2020, this number will swell to 40 trillion gigabytes.  
>  
>\- Professor Murtaza Haider (Professor of Data Science)

&#x200B;

>By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions  
>  
>\- McKinsey Global Institute

Okay, so there'll be exponentially more data year by year, we can gain insights from that data to improve our business decisions and save a literal fuck ton of money by doing so. Airbus for example claims that they've managed to speed up their A350 production process by 33% just by using PLTR's services. Now that's deep fucking value - not u/DeepFuckingValue deep fucking value I mean actual deep fucking value - literal millions/billions saved.

[So here are the forecasted Revenue Growths for PLTR's industry peers](https://preview.redd.it/f229ofiqvno61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dac321953bfd0559e3249df594f81cd2dcfb466)

Now see, when Papa Karp says 30% annual growth and Jefferie's says 40% annual growth - they're not actually high, that industry is just growing at an abnormal pace. By the end of FY 2023 PLTR's revenues (according to analyst estimates and assuming Papa Karp's 30% YoY growth) will have increased by 127% - crazy right? Well - Snowflake's projected to grow by 388% (although I'm a bit skeptical about that one). So on a Peer Median (92.3%) Palantir's 127% revenue growth doesn't actually sound too absurd (Snowflake 388% on the other hand - not sure).

Snowflake does have an impressive track record when it comes to their revenue growth (3x their revenues from 2018-2019, almost 3x from 2019-2020) hence why they have that valuation. However they're growing from a significantly smaller base than PLTR (roughly 60% of PLTR's revenues in FY 2020). Now remember the first topic we touched on? Higher growth expectations - bigger cash flows being further in the future, that's why Snowflake's Stock Price took a larger hit than PLTR with the rising treasury yields.

Let's talk about the current valuation based on the Price to Sales Ratio - Consider the recently IPO'd companies (Datadog, DynaTrace, Palantir and Snowflake) - forget about SolarWinds for a second.

They all have P/S Ratios between 21 and 105 (Snowflake lul). My point being: PLTR is not grossly overvalued, they'll grow into that valuation. If all goes according to plan and assuming the market cap stays constant, which obv it won't - PLTR will have a P/S Ratio of under 20 with the current valuation. Close to Adobe with a P/S ratio of 16.85.

*SolarWinds is at a P/S ratio of 5, that's partly due to them being hacked which pretty much a.) fucked their growth in FY 2020 and for the following years and b.) people dumping their stock after the hacks were medialised (Share price of 25$ on December 11th - down to 14$ December 18th).*

To get back to the profitability part real quick, after that you're dismissed - Datadog, Dynatrace and Snowflake - the new kids on the block - all reported a negative Net Income for 2020 and they've all been around for at least a decade. (Snowflake founded 2012 - soz) Amazon was founded 1994 and had their first \*reported\* profitable year in 2004 - a decade later, that's just how it goes in the software/digital services world apparently.

**Edit:** Soros Fund Management is expected to dump those shares whenever their lock-in expires - [George Soros raised ethical concerns regarding PLTR's modus operandi](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/george-soros-is-offloading-palantir-shares-due-to-business-practices.html). That's the same guy who shorted the Thai Baht and the GBP - literally screwing over entire economies - raising ethical concerns about his little 400M$ position in PLTR (Sure dude, nice PR stunt). Them being invested in PLTR since 2012 however shows that they do see some deep value.

**TLDR**: So all that being said - Whilst PLTR is getting a lot of attention in the media and on various other platforms including this subreddit - I personally do not think that PLTR is grossly overvalued. There's some asset inflation due to macroeconomic factors but considering how hot of a topic of discussion PLTR is right now (as compared to Datadog for example), it surprised me that they're not at a higher P/S (example Snowflake P/S 105). Their growth potential is huge but not irrealistic, it seems like they have the scalability figured out. From a purely operational PoV Palantir is profitable, the expenses that make it unprofitable on paper have nothing to do with their product/services, it's just some financial shenanigans - Adjusted Net Profit was positive in FY 2020 and is expected to increase by 66% during FY 2021.

If the economy doesn't come crashing down in the foreseeable future, this stonk will imo be worth a whole lot more than it is right now. Let's hope that Yellen has some positive fiscal policy news for us today.

Treasury yields are decreasing (1.65% today vs. 1.75% on the 10 YR Treasury Notes a week ago - they might also continue rising). We have a potential catalyst on the 14th of April (Demo Day), quarterly earnings some time in May, so if the macroeconomic factors are with us, we might see a ""recovery"" from the current price levels shortly. In the longer run we'll just have to hope that the economy doesn't come crashing down. Goldman says we're not currently in a bubble, here's a nice read on that topic: [Goldman Sachs Says Global Stock Markets Are Nowhere Near Risky Bubble - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/goldman-says-global-stock-markets-are-nowhere-near-risky-bubble), make your own opinion.

I'll post it again - I really liked u/ada_diamonds take [Former PLTR Engineer DD Part #2: Usability, Deployabilty, Scalability, & Submersibility + My Lockup Plan : PLTR (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lknie3/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/) \- I can't tell you why PLTR is different from the other suppliers like he can (Predictive analytics, incomplete datasets something something) so go check that DD out if you haven't already.

mbhg31,,wallstreetbets,post,1616513899,"$SIRI: the other satellite company that could (beat the short sellers)Since apparently you all consider each other financial advisors, I guess I need to tell you, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Hello and welcome to my DD for Sirius XM **($SIRI**), not to be confused with Apple's benevolent AI assistant. This is actually my first DD for you all, I hope you enjoy it. Sirius XM owns their satellite radio company and network, which is **factory installed in about 75% of new American cars**, and they **purchased Pandora in December 2019**, which was the largest internet radio company, whose only real competition is Spotify. I believe the company hasn't fully captured the gains from Pandora's acquisition, and it's in a perfect position to explode with smarter, connected vehicles becoming the norm. Pandora has by far the best learning algorithm to customize stations, and it's primed for some big deals, like the one it just signed with T-Mobile. This stock looks to me to be a fantastic pick, and here's some facts for you all:

1. The **float is 930M-960M shares**, and the short interest has hovered around 160M-200M shares for the past few years (20% of the float). **I know WSB loves to know about short interest, and that's damn high.**
2. Fundamentals are a dirty word here too, but this stock has pretty great fundamentals. **It's got a 25-35 P/E**, which is both low for a value stock, and low for a growth stock. 45 would be a conservative P/E for a company of this type, while a growth-focused company like Spotify has a -77 P/E ratio and **TSLA has a 1300+ P/E ratio**. Price tripling or quadrupling wouldn't be too difficult to stomach for the market, and that's not even what will happen if this goes to its rightful place in the **stars**.

2a. Still fundamental, **SIRI is actually profitable**, and managed to turn a profit even in the driving hell year of 2020. Almost every market caller has this ranked as being at least a $7-$8 stock, and they don't believe in the squeeze. **If this hits $10, that basically breaks open the option chain, and the market makers and hedges will have to scramble to hedge the stock properly.**

3. The stock is consistently trading in medium-high volumes (though nowhere near the short interest volume), meaning it's ready to move. For a stock with such high volume, **it's clearly only short interest holding the price down**. If market sentiment turns from neutral to bullish, this thing is going to take off.

4. **With low IV in the current option chain, nobody sees this coming. The buy-in on LEAPS is still cheap, and the upside is huge.** This stock looks like a no brainer, easily gonna go up in both the short term and long term, and potential to go way, way over the moon.

If you need positions, I own 500 shares and 50 LEAPS on this stock. **My short term price target is $9 by summer 2021, and $19 by summer 2022. Buy LEAPS on this, buy some shares, and print your own tickets.**

edit: The catalyst, since it's been asked, is that they merged with Pandora just before the pandemic hit and destroyed the economy. The purchase of another major company never even moved the needle, and there's pent up growth to realize as soon as things reopen, advertising starts to pick up again, and people start buying things. Spotify is their big competition right now, and Spotify is hemorrhaging money, that means there's gonna be a reckoning.","['AAPL', 'TSLA']"

But the app/web player lags behind streaming platforms like Spotify by sooooo much. I'm pretty sure they have free streaming trials so you can test how bad the product is for yourself. Also prepare to get bombarded by emails trying to get you to convert to a paying subscriber.

As for the Pandora merger I heard that is not going so well. But I've seen some of the work they do on the Pandora side and it's next level. Google the Music Genome Project.

I don't think they are going bankrupt anytime soon, but I feel like they need big changes to stand against the competition.",['GOOGL']

``````New Edit 3/23``````

**3/23** - Breaking news this morning, [SEC filings indicate](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001193125-21-090320) that Gamestop Chief Customer officer Frank Hamlin is stepping down after a transition ending 31 March. Who could possibly replace him? How about Kelli Durkin, Chewy’s prior Vice President of Customer Service who was [brought on with Gamestop March 1 as Senior VP of Customer Care](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer). There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.

No known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

*4* day action around that announcement (edited to include the 25th since the news dropped post-market on the 23rd):

02/25/2021 Open: $169.56 Close: $108.73 Vol: **150,308,800**

02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020


**Price Action following these news catalysts:**

[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

Here's how closing price trended around these two announcements:

2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**

2/24 - Close: $91.71

2/25 - Close: $108.73

2/26 - Close: $101.74

3/01 - Close: $120.40

3/02 - Close: $118.18

3/03 - Close: $124.18

3/04 - Close: $132.35

3/05 - Close: $137.74

3/08 - Close: $194.50 - **Committee announcement pre-market**

3/09 - Close: $246.90

3/10 - Close: $265.00 - **Day's high: $348.5 - flash crash attempt**

3/11 - Close: $260.00

3/12 - Close: $264.5


As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.

**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

**Editing to include some new info I dug up regarding the board members who will not be standing for re-election at the next board meeting.

An interesting find for anyone wondering about outgoing Gamestop board members who may own a large number of shares:

>**Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K.

Per [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-insiders-sold-stock-before-it-went-vertical-51611760507) three of the four members **sold a large % of their personal stake in Gamestop around January 13.** 

>GameStop Chair Kathy Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $1.4 million, a per-share average price of $27.99. Vrabeck, a senior client partner in the consumer markets division of Korn Ferry, now owns 79,537 GameStop shares. A director since June 2012, Vrabeck last sold stock in September 2015, selling 5,000 shares for $209,800, an average price of $41.96 each.

>Raul Fernandez sold 38,119 shares from Jan. 13 through 15 for a total of $1.4 million, a per-share average of $35.50. Fernandez is a vice chairman and owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, a private partnership that co-owns the NBA’s Washington Wizards and the NHL’s Washington Capitals. He now owns 29,289 GameStop shares. It is the first stock sale for Fernandez, who joined GameStop’s board in April 2019.

>Lizabeth Dunn sold 5,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $156,700, a per-share average price of $31.34. Dunn, founder and CEO of Pro4ma, an IT services consulting firm, now owns 57,258 GameStop shares. She joined the board in April 2019, and this is her first sale of stock.",['NDAQ']

mbllal,,wallstreetbets,post,1616524965,"Long on AALFor the last few weeks I have been following airline stocks quite closely. From what I have gathered, American Airlines is undervalued. I have multiple reasons why and will explain them below. What I am going to show you is why I like the stock.

Lets start with a comparison.

[AAL\_Comparison\_03232021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjXuI8XNQC2D7xGnP-oAGfS0d4k7sFh0QMVgYa7aRUU/edit?usp=sharing)

I comprised all similar airlines along with AAL into one spreadsheet, displaying their current value as of today, along with Market Cap, Income, and Sales. AAL is currently valued, according to these numbers, about 20 points lower than it should be. Of course though, this is just my opinion based on these numbers. Lets look at some more factual data.

&#x200B;

American Airlines is the largest passenger airline in the world, with roughly 1440 aircraft and 900 operational at any time. Because of this, American Airlines is in control of the passenger market. 

[Airline Wikipedia Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America)

This data shows up to 2020, which gives a good idea of what the pandemic has inflicted on this industry. Yes, numbers are low but we need to look at where we are headed.

&#x200B;

According to this data, we are looking at 85% vaccinated by Dec. In my opinion, the speed at which we are administering vaccines, I think May will be primed for at least 40% vaccinated. Most states are sitting at somewhere between 10-20% vaccinated. The US in total is 13.5% fully vaccinated, with 24.9% having at least received one dose. This wide of a spread between first and second doses, tells me that we are moving fast towards a majority vaccinated.

[NPR Vaccination Visualization](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state)

There is a lot of data about every country and its reopening plan. Link below will show an article with most countries plan to reopen. This data to me, is a bit more convoluted, and subject to change at any moment depending on new cases of the virus. From what I have gathered, some countries would rather be open for tourists, mainly Caribbean countries. Others, like large EU players, are staying shut for much longer. Less reliable data, but still data none the less. What it tells me, is that there is places to go if you want to fly.

On a less positive note, American Airlines sentiment is low. 

[Forbes Top Airlines 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2020/05/04/the-best-and-worst-airlines-of-2020/?sh=72e8ed0e1a8e)

American Airlines is last on the list, and for many good reasons. A recent merger, and internal company issues has made this airline a difficult one to manage and project a good face. I believe with a bit of time, they will be back up higher on this list. Controlling the largest fleet of aircraft allows for some lee way when it comes to passenger complaints. From speaking to friends in different cities, I have found that American Airlines is sometimes the only way to go. This is not hard data. This is simply an understanding that with the largest fleet, comes the ability to set your own price and do things your way. If American Airlines is the only option, people will be forced to fly AA. 

&#x200B;

In my honest opinion, I see at least a 10 point gain if not more, from this stock. I like this stock and see it as an easy investment, with returns as early as may, as late as August.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/mb100z/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I have literally spent my entire day since market closed writing these posts so I hope they are useful to somebody. The 1st part introduced Impulse waves rules and guidelines. The 2nd part covered Diagonals and the first corrective waves - zigzags. I also included some examples of actual charts, rather than the simple drawings in the first post. If you have not read part 1 or 2 yet, please do before reading this. I would advise everyone to save each part and read them over again as they learn.

Anyway, here goes.

**Corrective waves**

*Contracting Triangles:*

Rules:

* A triangle always subdivides into five waves
* At least four waves among waves A, B, C, D and E each subdivide into a zigzag or zigzag combination
* Wave C never moves beyond the end of wave A, wave D never moves beyond the end of wave B, and wave E never moves beyond the end of C. The result is that, going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D converges with a line connecting the ends of waves A and C (forming a triangle)
* A triangle never has more than one complex subwave, in which case it is always a zigzag combination or a triangle.

Guidelines:

* Usually, wave C subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves
* Sometimes, wave D subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves
* Sometimes one of the waves, usually wave C, D, or E, subdivides into a contracting or barrier triangle. Often the effect is as if the entire triangle consisted of nine zigzags
* About 60% of the time, wave B does not end beyond the start of wave A. When it does, the triangle is called a running triangle

*Barrier Triangle*

* A barrier triangle has the same characteristics as a contracting triangle except that waves B and D end at essentially the same level
* When wave 5 follows a triangle, it is typically either a brief, rapid movement or an exceptionally long extension

&#x200B;

*Expanding Triangle*

Rules:

Most rules are the same as for contracting triangles, with these differences:

* Wave C, D, and E each moves beyond the end of the preceding semi-directional subwave (The result is that going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D diverges from a line connecting the ends of waves A and C)
* Subwaves B, C and D each retrace at least 100% but no more than 150% of the preceding subwave

&#x200B;

Guidelines:

Most guidelines are the same as well, with these differences:

* Subwaves B, C and D usually retrace 105 to 125% of the preceding subwave
* No subwave has yet been observed to subdivide into a triangle

&#x200B;

*Combinations*

Rules:

* Combinations comprise two or three corrective patterns seperated by one or two corrective patterns in the opposite direction, labeled as X (The first corrective pattern is labeled W, the second Y and the third, if there is one, Z)
* A zigzag combination comprises two or three zigzags (in which case it is called a double or triple zigzag)
* A ""double three"" flat combination comprises (in order) a zigzag and a flat, a flat and a zigzag, a flat and a flat, a zigzag and a triangle or a flat and a triangle
* A rare ""triple three"" flat combination comprises three flats
* Double and triple zigzags take the place of zigzags and double and triple threes take the place of flats and triangles
* An expanding triangle has yet to be observed as a component of a combination

Guidelines:

* When a zigzag or flat appears too small to be the entire wave with respect to the preceding wave (or if it is to be wave 4, the preceding wave 2) a combination is likely.

&#x200B;

**General Advice For Using Elliot Waves**

* The best approach is deductive reasoning. By knowing what Elliot rules will not allow, you can deduce that whatever remains is the proper perspective
* Have a preferred count and an alternative count - Its important not to be biased when trading!
* Always invest with the preferred count - until proven wrong!

&#x200B;

I just want to leave this last note as well:

The trick to trading is to notice that it is all just waves within waves. Patterns within patterns. Whether it is on the 1 minute time frame, the 1 hour, or the 1 month. The patterns are the same, just of different amplitudes. The bigger the time frame, the more important the pattern. The same could be said of life really. Shit happens, but its only one event in the grand scheme of things. Zoom out if you need to. And if that doesn't help - Zoom out again.

I like seeing people make those sweet sweet gains and tendies galore. So I decided to make this post to help you autists sharpen your crayons and actually use them for a greater purpose than just as snacks to eat in between buying calls on whatever stock is hot for the day.

Elliot Waves are a theory that markets move in stages of a theoretical ""2 steps forward, one step back"" type movement (in this case 5 advances with 3 pullbacks, usually followed by 2 declines with 1 advance). They were first observed and described in the mid 1900's. For more background info, and a full description of Elliot waves, their history and uses, and applications, I would advise everyone to read ""Elliot wave Principles: Key to market behaviour"" by A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter. You can access this for free at [https://z-lib.org/](https://z-lib.org/)

&#x200B;

This post will outline a summary of Rules and Guidelines for Elliot Waves:

**Motive Waves**

*Impulse:*

Rules:

* An impulse wave always subdivides into 5 waves
* Wave 1 always subdivides into an impulse or (rarely) a diagonal
* Wave 3 always subdivides into an impulse
* Wave 5 always divides into an impulse or diagonal
* Wave 2 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat or combination
* Wave 4 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat, triangle or combination
* Wave 2 never moves beyond the start of wave 1
* Wave 3 always moves beyond the end of wave 1
* Wave 3 is never the shortest wave
* Wave 4 never moves beyond the end of wave 1
* Never are waves 1, 3 and 5 all extended

Guidelines:

* Wave 4 will almost always be a different corrective pattern than wave 2
* Wave 2 is usually a zigzag or zigzag combination
* Wave 4 is usually a flat, triangle or flat combination
* Sometimes wave 5 does not move beyond the end of wave 3 (in which case it is called a truncation)
* Wave 5 often ends when meeting or slightly exceeding a line drawn from the end of wave 3 that is parallel to the line connecting the ends of waves 2 and 4
* The centre of wave 3 almost always has the steepest slope of any equal period within the parent impulse except that sometimes an early portion of wave 1 (the kickoff) will be steeper
* Wave 1, 3, or 5 is usually extended (an extension appears ""stretched"" because its corrective waves are small compared to its impulse waves. It is substantially longer and contains larger sub-divisions than the non-extended waves
* Often the extended subwave is the same number (1, 3 or 5) as the parent wave
* Rarely do two subwaves extend, although it is typical for waves 3 and 5 both to extend when they are of Cycle or Supercycle degree and within a fifth wave of one degree higher
* Wave 1 is the least commonly extended wave
* When wave 3 is extended, waves 1 and 5 tend to have gains related by equality or the Fibonnaci ratio
* When wave 5 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 1through 3
* When wave 1 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 3 through 5
* Wave 4 typically ends when it is within the price range of subwave four of 3
* Wave 4 often subdivides the entire impulse into Fibonnaci proportions in time and/or price

&#x200B;

Some basic examples:

It seems after the comparisons, in terms of PFOF fees relative to costs, Chase and Merrill Lynch might be the best brokerage. As for how fast Chase orders are, I could not find any information. For those with more money, IBKR Pro seems to make sense especially with really low margin rates.

I assume the brokerages that posted their execution speeds are ones that are confident they are far above average.

Also, do keep in mind there's also stuffs like price improvement, execution price, effective spread, etc. to take into account. I just wanted to sum up some of the brokerages.

I use Fidelity as my main brokerage and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Fidelity #1. Everything so good :3.

What are your thoughts/recommendations on which brokerage to use?",['SPGI']

mavc3b,,wallstreetbets,post,1616440052,"$UWMC: The Trinity play of 2021 Value/Gamma/Float! When the Squozes keep on squoozing...**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an  entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB with a  bias due to having a large position in $UWMC. So, proceed on your own  risk... and don't act on anything written here.**

**- If you are here for an option play, this is the wrong place. You will most probably get burned.**

Hello fellow Ape! Don't be shy come closer 🍌 Today I'll introduce to you the Trinity play of the Moon 2021! So buckle up ape and wear your space suit 👨‍🚀

[$UWMC Trinity](https://preview.redd.it/pl1qqwt3omo61.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=b154b0f1151688de79c331aac577dfd9d1848a98)

1- $UWMC has a float of approximately 90.23 Million(Market Watch). In ape language, there is a relatively a small amount of stocks available on the market for fellow apes to buy. **This makes the stock very volatile and able to easily moon** if a lot of Apes buy it. In addition and more importantly, When enzinga asked Matt Ishba(CEO) if he would do an offering(offer more stocks to the float which would decrease it) he responded with ""I'm much more of a long-term holder of the business than a seller."" \~ SO NO!!!

I dare you to find any other stock with same float and potential!

2- $UWMC has a massive Gamma squeeze potential if it reaches 10$+ and stays over. The open interest is insane and to put that into perspective, there are 91,835 Calls(I'm only counting the upcoming 2 dates April and May with strikes up to 15$)\~ **worth 9,183,500 shares which equals Approx 10% of FLOAT if they get exercised!!!** Can you comprehend how insane is that? and I didn't even count all the calls... These are only for the 2 upcoming dates.

Bellow is the most recent Call Option Chain (I used Crayons to better illustrate):

[Option Chain April](https://preview.redd.it/vf4kof6aomo61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c46ed9d9cdae14e4a1c52e1e4aa5bcdde167e9)

[Option Chain May](https://preview.redd.it/vyv4s7ccomo61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ede5f7729a4cf909acfb6a11cdbfea0f96c6d92)

3- Now for the short squeeze potential, This month's short interest hasn't been out yet, but we can try to approximate it by taking a look at the short volume. For the past 5 Business days, **$UWMC had a short volume with an average of 24.288 and on Thursday it was 32.09(Fintel)!!** To put that into perspective, $AMC, a heavily shorted stock, had an average short volume of only 15.24 for the past 5 business days(Fintel). **With this low float and high short volume, this could be a Mars shot passing the Moon...**

[Short Volume](https://preview.redd.it/mt6wenfgomo61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f33dd04302d321a993a227c1a4bc45ec4868b01)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\- Even without the trinity, $UWMC is still an undervalued stock. It has a fair value of 19.68$ on SWS!! I could go into details about how it's undervalued, but I'm not going to do that today. You can Look at other DD's on WSB.

\- By now, $UWMC is all over WSB and in my opinion it's only a matter of time until it moons in a one shot to the moon.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For the most important part

What this stock really needs is exposure. If you believe in it and think it’s undervalued, **you can share $UWMC posts or make your own DD to give this stock more exposure.** **Every post matters!!** If people believe in it as much as you do, they might buy it and we can hopefully all eat Tendies on the  Moon(soon)!! **I hope it trends on StockTwits one day because ST is a market mover in my opinion.**

**I wouldn't buy any call options anymore because they will not only not push the stock upwards, but  they also have a very high risk of expiring worthless!**

**My short term Price target is 39$**",
mavc3b,gruft8z,wallstreetbets,comment,1616440949,"Ugh. UWMC is not a squeeze, it's not a meme, it's not a p'n'd. It's a value play from fundamentals, and no one should be buying into it unless they can afford to wait several weeks.  


If anything, the stock needs less attention, since every over-the-hill losing-their-edge greyhaired analyst loves fucking over WSB darlings now that it's a household name.",
mavc3b,gruhjbd,wallstreetbets,comment,1616441727,"It has a low float, yes. Gamma squeeze.... no. Short squeeze, really doubt it. Its a good long term play if you have money to invest and wait. And by invest, I mean buying shares, not retarded options. 

With that said, this is wsb, so fuck investing. Start buying FD's. 

Seriously though I know there's about 8 million noobs reading these things and thinking ""easy money"" ... it's not, it's a good long term play (investment) or a gamble. 

Positions: I've been selling CSP's because if I get called on I don't mind holding for the long term, and then selling Cc's against it as time progresses.",

mavv1m,gruu1f9,wallstreetbets,comment,1616447423,"So the company produces extremely bearish signals and you decide that this is the point to catch the knife?

Power to you, if it works.

But... CEO gifts some 750k shares away on Friday to his relatives (who don't have to file if they sell, IIRC). Great timing.

And yall literally just voted on AMC proposing to dilute shares for a ~~first~~, ~~second~~, ~~third~~, ~~fourth~~, *fifth* time in 12 months.

Until the company produces *a valuable promise of a ROI + boon for days* i absolutely do not understand why anyone would participate in such a selfless charity stock.

Reopening business as usual and sacrificing share holder's value is not the way.

You're a sheep, walking to slaughter.

maxzm0,grv8pzd,wallstreetbets,comment,1616454568,"Based on this if eps is $2.10, that means the p/e is trading at 4.16. I believe rkt is currently trading at a 6.8. In q4 2020 Uwmc had 54b in closed loan volume in with 305bps of margin. 

For q1 2021 they guided for closed loan volume of 52-57b and total margin of 200-235bps, their going to have roughly 20% less profit q1 compared to q4. 

This would make their P/E ratio closer to 5. Still undervalued and I’m not sure how much of their guidance, if any factored in the relaunching of their jumbo loan program. 

I can see why the stock didn’t take off After hours on this release, there isn’t really anything new in this that wasn’t already factored in. 

It’s definitely trading under fair value but it’s going to need a new catalyst in order to get this back over 10, I.e index inclusion, blowout q1 earnings etc. 

I have a boat load of 4/16 calls but I think time is pretty much up on those and will be taking the L and rolling them out to august calls.
