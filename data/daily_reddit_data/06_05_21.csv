The correct mentality (but it obviously doesn't sell/appeal as much) is thinking in YEARS not MONTHS. You got in February 2021, congrats. There is so much for you to learn. So many industries. So many financial instruments. Learn, learn, learn. But the truth is you've been in the stock market for only 2 months. That's nothing in stock market time. You have to start thinking in years.

Invest in companies that will be good in 3, 5, 10 years. If an investment goes down -10% in 2 months, think to yourself, does the reason I bought this stock still hold up in the long term? If yes, buy the dip or chill out because you've got confidence in the stock. If not, just sell it.

n67yep,,stocks,post,1620309677,"Has tech got you down? Consider commodities, in particular, steel. For a variety of reasons:Steel manufacturing companies are set to make record profits in the next few years. Demand is up huge. [The post-COVID boom is starting.](https://www.appraisalbuzz.com/biggest-construction-boom-since-2006-best-2-weeks-for-rates-in-a-year/) The rotation out of tech is under way. And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:

-----------------------------------

**Steel prices are obscenely high**

These are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 – 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) 

And this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) 

This means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).

--------------------------------

**Inflation**

The hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation? Many expect inflation to climb regardless as there has been so much money printed. During periods of high inflation, Michael Burry thinks you want to be in [real estate and commodities](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859/photo/1). 

And even if inflation doesn’t cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.

------------------------------------

**China's rebate**

In 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world’s steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.

But now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. 

Starting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff & 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it’s getting a lot worse.

Starting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor’s product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.

**Where in particular to invest?** 

Steel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)

There is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.

CLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will ""look after shareholders"" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.

CLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.

As people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. 

MT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade. [Commodities Boom Grips Steel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/arcelormittal-reports-best-quarter-in-decade-as-steel-joins-boom) 

And these amazing Q1 numbers don't even fully account for the new record high prices. Steel's day is just beginning. This is not a buy-today and sell-tomorrow play, this is a buy-sometime-soon and hold-for-a-long-time play.

Positions: I have shares and LEAPs in CLF and MT at a variety of strikes.","['AAPL', 'TWTR']"

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) today announced the U.S. Coast Guard has extended its commitment to use Palantir’s software to help it respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Palantir is proud to help enhance Coast Guard readiness, and keep their staff and families safe. We look forward to continuing to provide the Coast Guard with the very best technology to help them ensure our Nation's maritime safety and security”

The Coast Guard has been using Palantir’s software since April 2020 as the data management, analytics, and operations tool for its response to the pandemic. This contract renewal has a base value of $6.25 million and a potential total amount of $11.25 million for nine months.

Palantir’s software enables centralized collaboration of workspaces across the country, offering real-time visibility into critical data for Coast Guard members anywhere, across ranks, to make informed and risk-based decisions. The Coast Guard will continue to use Palantir to create a common operating picture and help determine resource allocation, including vaccines, to best respond to the pandemic and enhance readiness.

The Coast Guard announced on April 21 that it had fully vaccinated over 50% of its members since its vaccination campaign began only four months ago.

“Palantir is proud to help enhance Coast Guard readiness, and keep their staff and families safe. We look forward to continuing to provide the Coast Guard with the very best technology to help them ensure our Nation's maritime safety and security,” said Doug Philippone, Palantir’s Global Defense Lead.

Palantir has played a key role in mitigating the global COVID-19 pandemic, supporting more than 100 organizations in their response to the pandemic, including across the U.S. government and military. At the Coast Guard, Palantir's software has enabled operational management of the pandemic response, including collaborative logistics planning, vaccine distribution and inventory tracking, and centralized field reporting.",

LOS ANGELES AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. --
The U.S. Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center’s Cross-Mission Ground & Communications Enterprise (ECX) has awarded a firm-fixed price contract totaling $32.5 million, to Palantir.

This sole source award provides a Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) Platform and converges three separate mission areas (Space C2, NORAD-NORTHCOM, and Project Brown Heron) using the same tech stack called Warp Core. It supports the Project Brown Heron effort under the U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, by providing a common data foundation that improves readiness information, which is a critical component of DAF-wide COVID-19 analysis and decision-making effort. This award also enables the NORAD-NORTHCOM Command and Control Center to ingest data into the platform from across functional and geographic domains to support ongoing planning and operations for Joint All-Domain Command and Control. Lastly, this effort will provide mission-critical Space Domain Awareness (SDA) and C2 capabilities to operational users at the National Space Defense Center and the Combined Space Operations Center. 

DaaS is data management strategy that centralizes data sets where it is cleansed and enriched for a broad audience of applications. This enterprise approach enables speed and improves trend analysis to help facilitate enhanced strategic decision making for leadership. “By integrating this commercial product into our architecture, we have been able to accelerate our ability to make real-time data driven decisions. Information that would take 'man-years' to pull together and try to synthesize and analyze now takes minutes” said Col. Jennifer Krolikowski, senior materiel leader for Space C2 in ECX. 

Warp Core leverages Palantir Gotham, a fully-featured, highly customizable commercial off-the-shelf solution for data integration, analysis, visualization, and knowledge management, deployed worldwide by government agencies and commercial enterprises. Palantir’s powerful back end and flexible front end address all aspects of data integration and analysis within a unified, easy-to-use platform. It also connects with the USSF Unified Data Library to integrate data from across the space enterprise.

Space C2 program, also known as Kobayashi Maru, under SMC's ECX provides capabilities that bring critical services to our warfighters to facilitate timely, quality driven battlespace decisions for the space domain fight. The program provides infrastructure and enterprise services, as well as develops mission applications to enable responsive, resilient operational-level Space C2 capabilities for space operations centers. Kobayashi Maru’s mission product lines include Battle Management, Command and Control (BMC2), Space Domain Awareness, Data Analytics and Visualization, and Theater and Coalition Support. These efforts all focus on developing the operational echelon of Space C2 mission applications to deliver multi-domain effects. The operational C2 layer that Kobayashi Maru provides, underpins foundational offensive and defensive space control capabilities for the USSF space enterprise.

The U.S. Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center, located at the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, California, is the center of excellence for acquiring and developing military space systems. SMC’s portfolio includes space launch, global positioning systems, military satellite communications, a meteorological satellite control network, range systems, space-based infrared systems, and space situational awareness capabilities.",['EL']

Peloton is recalling its Tread+ and Tread treadmills, the at-home fitness company said on Wednesday, less than a month after it fought the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission as it warned that dozens of injuries and one death of a child had been linked to the machines.

The commission, which issued an “urgent warning” for the machines in April, urged people who own the treadmills to immediately stop using them. Peloton is offering a full refund for the $4,295 machine with a 32-inch touch screen that allows runners to work out with the aid of instructors.

John Foley, the chief executive of Peloton, said in a statement Wednesday that the company had “made a mistake” by fighting the agency’s request to recall the treadmills, and apologized for not engaging “more productively with them from the outset.”

“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s members and their families,” he said in the statement.

The machines were sold in the United States from November to March. The company is working on a repair to be offered to customers “in the coming weeks,” the commission said in a statement. The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.

“Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products,” Robert S. Adler, the acting chairman of the commission, said in the statement.

The commission said it had received 72 reports of adults, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Twenty-nine involved children, including a 6-year-old boy who died.

After the death of the child in March, the company urged users to keep Peloton products where children can’t get to them and store safety keys away from children",['MS']

n6a4a2,,stocks,post,1620315489,"How you should start with investingI've seen a ton of posts recently from new investors asking how they should get started in investing along with a lot of posts from people who have just gotten into the stock market, lost a lot of money and are now panicking. As such I figured I'd just make a quick post to recommend what I feel is the best way to get started in the stock market.

**Step 1: Take 90% of your capital that you would like to invest and put it in a total market index fund like VTI or FZROX**

You're new at this, no matter how much research you have done you don't know what you're doing and will make mistakes. Putting your money into an index fund will give you good returns along with the security of knowing with 99.999% certainty that if there is a dip it WILL recover (and if it doesn't you probably have bigger problems to worry about). It will also help you get used to the ups and downs of the market without getting emotional.

**Step 2: Start paper trading**

Most brokerages offer a ""paper trading"" account. These are accounts where you invest with fake money and can track how you would have done with these investments. I know you're excited and want to start investing now so you can make money, but you're new and will likely fall into one of several common pitfalls of new investors, better to do this with fake money than real money. And besides if you follow step 1 your money *is* invested and you are getting good returns.

**Step 3*: Start using your 10% cash to make real stock purchases**

 Once you do well after a few months to a year of paper trading (it seems like a long time I know but trust me the stock market will still be there when you're done), take some of your remaining capital and start buying stocks. Real investing is not like paper trading when it comes to your actual money, keep that in mind. You will find yourself panicking for the first time here, that's fine, remember the vast majority of your money is in a solid investment with little risk and good returns.

**Step 4*: Start moving more into stock picks**

After a few years of doing well with your 10%, if you feel like you'd rather pick your own stocks over using an index fund then start moving money out of your total market index funds into individual stock picks

And that's it, that's (in my opinion) the best way to get started in the stock market. Any additional tips from you guys?

*These steps aren't actually necessary, you can just leave 100% of your capital in total market index funds and you will be fine, in fact that's what I would recommend you do but I realize that many people, especially those that come to this subreddit, would rather take their chances and try to outperform the market",['UPS']

I know they are a bit of a meme stock, but I began adding them to my portfolio after the price settled following the pump and dump at the end of March, because I felt it was a good play.

I was looking over the call transcript and am just seeing more reasons to be bullish, in summary - their goal is to be the leading retail home mortgage provider in the next two years, have a 90% customer retention rate, were voted one of the best workplaces and have a liquid position with positive cash flow.  

Some of the fundamental indicators like price to sales ratio of 2.3 looks on par with some financial companies (WFC, JPM). Compared to other internet/tech companies they are a big value play.  PEG of 0.24

n6byd0,,stocks,post,1620320311,"VIAC is very undervalued in an overvalued market and just had an amazing earnings reportVIAC is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping.","['NFLX', 'VIAC']"

Volkswagen throws down the emissions gauntlet](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/how-low-can-you-go-volkswagen-throws-down-emissions-gauntlet-2021-05-05/)

Excerpt:

> Three sources told Reuters that Volkswagen, which owns car brands including Porsche, Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda, is quietly letting policymakers in Brussels know that it would support more ambitious cuts in emissions than other car manufacturers.

Further:

> Volkswagen has set itself a 2025 deadline for overtaking U.S. pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O) and becoming the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), a plan that includes building six battery factories in Europe alone by 2030.

Details:

> Tensions over emissions cuts came to a head at a board meeting of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in March, two people familiar with the matter said.

> Several chief executives said they were concerned about the prospect of tougher EU standards, as they could blow a hole in profits from fossil-fuel engines that could not yet be plugged by electric vehicles, the two people said.

> But Diess took a more upbeat view, saying his company's EVs would achieve cost parity by the mid-2020s, a comment that raised eyebrows among fellow CEOs at the meeting including Renault's Luca de Meo, one of the people said.

Also:

> At the moment, the European industry must deliver fleet-wide cuts in emissions of 37.5% by 2030 for new passenger cars from 2021 limits - equivalent to a reduction from 95 grams of CO2 per km this year to 59 g/km at the end of the decade.

> One person familiar with the matter said the industry was now bracing for this target reduction to rise to at least 50% when the European Commission unveils its plans.

And:

> Selling mass-market EVs is also vital to earn valuable carbon credits that carmakers can sell to rivals struggling to meet EU emissions targets.

> EV champions can even make a business selling credits to heavy emitters. Tesla, for example, sold Italy's FCA European and U.S. CO2 credits worth 2 billion euros from 2019 to 2021, and green credit sales helped boost its first-quarter revenue.","['DE', 'TSLA']"

That doesn't mean stocks will definitely hold or rebound at these levels, but they do represent key inflection points: holding at these levels increases the likelihood that the selling is done, while failing to hold these levels suggests further selling is likely.

DOCU: Bearish cross of the 50/200 day moving averages a couple of weeks ago, and is now trading below a declining 50 DMA and a flattening 200 DMA.  Both bearish signs.  However, the stock has pulled back to a key demand level in the 185-190 area.  The stock has previously held this level 8 times over the past year, and hasn't traded below it since late June, 2020.  Holding this level is really, really important for the stock.  If it fails, there is no support level and we could see a long decline.

ETSY: Just posted some kick-ass earnings but getting punished like most stocks on concerns (which are totally expected) of slowing growth compared to COVID growth rates.  However, the technical damage isn't nearly as bad as in DOCU.  The stock is trading well below the 50 DMA, which has recently turned down, and today is gapping down below the rising 200 DMA.  ETSY hasn't traded below the 200 DMA since the original COVID crash of March 2020.  So the stock needs to rebound here and reclaim the 200 DMA.  If it can't, the next stop could be the demand area of 115-130, which is another 18-20% down from here.

PINS: Similar to ETSY in many ways, posted kick-ass earnings but expecting growth to slow compared to COVID numbers, and also trading well below the declining 50 DMA.  It is now testing the 200 DMA, which is still rising, and like ETSY it needs to hold this level.  If it doesn't, there really isn't a solid demand zone until we hit around $35, which is more than 40% below current levels.

TDOC: This one is a technical disaster. Bearish 50/200 cross recently with the 50 DMA sharply declining and the 200 DMA now turning down. Lost a recent demand zone and is now testing the next one.  Further weakness from here and we could see a long decline, like DOCU.

Happy to look at some other charts by request.",['ETSY']

n5qbf7,,stocks,post,1620248043,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 5, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**

Stocks reversed from yesterday’s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, “I do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it’s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it’s consumer confidence, whether it’s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a “mistake”. He said, “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about its plans to expand to the European markets.
* Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year. Virgin Galactic plans to reopen ticket sales after the founder makes his own first flight, now slated for the summer after several delays.
* The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
* Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates.

n6cuq2,,stocks,post,1620322694,"Can someone explain how to make money buying covered puts (instead of just breaking even)?I understand the general idea of a put: I'm buying a contract that gives me the option to sell stock at a certain price by a certain date.

What I can't get my head around is how you'd make money buying a put (well, a covered put, anyway; I understand how you can make a lot of money shorting, even though it's risky).

Let's use GME as an example. Right now, the stock trading at $163. A $155 GME put has a premium of $0.83, so a single put contract costs $83 total. But in order to cover that put, I need to start with 100 shares of GME, valued at $16,300.

Let's say I buy the contract for $83, and the stock price drops to $150. I have the option of selling my shares at $155, but why would I ever exercise that? I'd lose $8 a share from where I started, to say nothing of the $83 I'm down for the contract itself.

Do I just sell the put contract to someone else to make back the premium? Because even if I did sell the contract and keep my shares, I've now lost $13 a share when the price fell from $163 to $150. Would selling the contract actually break me even, let alone make me money?


Are puts just supposed to be a tool for stopping your losses, instead of making money? Are you even ever supposed to exercise puts?

Any help would be appreciated!",

you do not need the funds to exercise an option. you can sell the option itself for a profit. if you buy the 155P for 83 and by expiration gme is at 150, the put will be worth 500 and you can sell the put for 417 profit.

also, if you did exericse it,you could just buy the shares at the 150 price and exercise the put to sell at 155, again giving you a profit of 500 - 83 = 417.",

I recently saw a Dutch company doing exactly this and I wanted to share this one with you guys as an example and as food for discussion about the industry in general. 
It's called Dutch Green Business (DGB). This is probably the first time you're hearing about this company, so let me first tell a bit more about it. Dutch Green Business (AMS:DGB) is a Dutch company that I've been eyeing for a while. It's a stock listed at the Amsterdam Exchange Euronext. It was a shell stock until recently, when a new CEO picked up and started a green business model. It's business model revolves around reforesting crucial areas around the world and selling the carbon credits it obtains from this. Despite being rather small it has been hogging the limelight quite a bit recently. Not too long ago former British politician Nigel Farage (!) joined the Advisory Board of DGB.

n5w99a,,stocks,post,1620265438,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DDVista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock. But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones. The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business). This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government. Those people all buy ammo. Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap. The national ammo shortage still persists to this day. Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online. It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend. They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings? Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades. They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day. Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter. Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6. Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping. But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog. Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high. Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b. About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK. Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends. I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33. Long-term bullish. I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!). So I'm posting it now. Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",

n5pc5x,,stocks,post,1620245515,"Most Don't Beat The S&P 500 IndexAs many of you know, the S&P 500 Index is a great way to invest as it reduces all your individual stock risk also known as non-systematic risk and we have been lucky to have had some great years of a strong bull market. 

Most professionals don't beat the index and only a select few beat it and the ones who beat it usually don't beat it the following year. Why would you or me be able to beat the market? The answer is we probably won't and we are better off just investing in SPY (S&P 500 ETF). 

We waste time (our most valuable resource) and money to individually pick stocks and in a lot of cases, we don't beat the index and sometimes lose money. 

One of my favorite investors/teachers  Aswath Damodaran said something along this ""I pick stocks because I love the process of looking at companies and analyzing them and in the end if I lose money or do worse than the index, I am fine with that because I did something I loved"".

I pick stocks because I love the process of trying to find ""undervalued"" stocks and learning more about industries and hoping to make money, but I also own an S&P 500 index. I am okay if I lose money because I knew the risks beforehand. If you don't like the process of researching or spending time looking at stocks, you are probably better of investing in an index.

Good luck investing",['SPGI']
n5pc5x,gx2icnm,stocks,comment,1620246326,"Numbered points below not my words, copied from another comment a while back that put forth a good case for why individual active investors shouldn’t compare themselves to professional money managers:

1. Money managers have performance carrots and sticks that require them to think short term.
2. Most work for a fund that is restricted to a given strategy, even when that strategy is not the optimal one.
3. Many simply have too much money and so many highly profitable but too-small-dollar opportunities are out of their reach.
4. Money managers have to worry about an influx of money after a run of good performance, swelling their funds after the good money has already been made.
5. Money managers have to worry about outflows of money after a negative event, being forced to sell at low prices and forfeit cash right when opportunities become plentiful.
6. Money managers have to fear being caught in losing (or early) contrarian bets and looking foolish or stupid.

Small investors can invest in small-cap companies or other opportunities that are too tiny for institutions  to bother with.

Uranium miners are a good example of this. Their market cap is so small that for someone like a black rock to take even less that 0.1% of their positions in them, they would end up outright owning the company. And so they don’t bother - it’s not worth the amount of time for them, even if they do get back 500% gains.

Buffett has spoken about the advantages  small investors benefit from, in that they’re nimble and can take significant positions and always find buys and sellers from the market makers without it affecting the stock price.

Graham Greene before he passed away had spoken about how value investing is still possible once you look outside large-cap stocks - too little places to invest in for institutions makes large-cap the only way to go, and so you have a lot of sophisticated money looking at the same subset of stocks, hard for the individual investor to beat.

I agree though, S&P 500 and other such indexes are great. Just food for thought.

Yes, not every company will succeed and outperform the market, but I think that at any given time, given the tools and time necessary, any basic observer can select a few undervalued companies that will outperform the market over a span of multiple years. It's not that hard to find a great company at this time, and lots of amazing companies are beaten down so low.

Today, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.

*Why should you care?*

The recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).

The company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.

*Alright… 100x if everything goes well, right?*

Yes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).

**Desirability**

*Targeted Segment*

Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST’s satellites like 5G towers in space.
Of the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.

To put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.

*Customer Relationships & Channels*

All the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.

*Value Proposition*

Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.
Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.

**Feasibility**

*Key Partners*

In the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.
They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).

Regarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.

*Key Activities*

AST will design and integrate the satellites. The company’s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.

Of course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.

Future agreements won’t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.

*Key Resources*

Talent, technology, and funding.

Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.

As mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST’s technology and has concluded that it works.

For further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company’s plan for global coverage.

**Viability**

*Revenue Streams*

Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.

*Cost Structure*

Because the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.

Now let's talk about an important topic: Risk.

**Risk**

*Tech(nichal/nology) risks*

* Launch delays for BW3 (final full-size prototype) might increase costs. especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle. This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021.

* Technology does not work. While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1, there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing.

* The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries. Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone.

*Commercial risks*

* End-users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers. Difficult to see why that would be the case.

* Telecom companies do not see value in AST's offering. AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise.

From a risk perspective, technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside. The company could literally go to 0 (or close to it if they can sell some of their techs/patents/etc.). However, I believe the company offers a unique risk/reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market.

**The long-term play**

Shares, shares, shares.

**The short-term play**

The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.
Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers’ agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.

TL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years

Disclosure: 35,000 shares

Edit: While we may see movement on catalysts after the silent period ends, this is mainly a long-term (2-3 years) investment into a very asymmetric opportunity.

Edit2: Thanks for all the feedback so far. I added a Risk section.",['AMT']

n5ydyf,,stocks,post,1620272584,"Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?Hi r/stocks,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

**Key Numbers**

Price: \~$18.54

Market Cap: $3.73B

**Description**

Genius Sports ($GENI) recently reverse merged with DMYD to become a publicly traded company. GENI provides sports data and solutions in multiple ways. Recently, they centralized all of the NCAA’s sports data and stats. This would be 1,100 universities and colleges among three divisions. As such, they were able to provide sports data for 50,000 events in their first 18 months of going live. NCAA basketball, football, volleyball, ice hockey and soccer leagues all use the Genius Sports LiveStats software. 

Furthermore, Genius provides media solutions for both sports teams and sportsbooks. For example, the Vancouver Canucks hired them to target ads to fans for special offers on tickets. This led to an 875% return on investment for the Canucks, so it’s a service they’re likely to keep using. The media department is just getting started as Genius just [doubled their revenue in that department](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/).

Most importantly and what amounts to 74% of their revenue, Genius Sports provides sports betting data in a variety of ways. First and foremost, they supply 40% of the sportsbooks with their betting lines, and this includes live betting. DraftKings, FanDuel, bet365, and many other Sportsbooks use GENI’s software and data for line setting. What this means is that it doesn’t matter which sportsbook does the best, as GENI supplies data to many of them.

Genius Sports is currently the leader in their field, and they have exclusive rights with multiple leagues. Among those are FIBA (pretty much every basketball league not in the USA), the NCAA, NFL, English Premier League, and many more. GENI actually has employees in attendance at the games to ensure they get the data in real time. Genius currently covers more than 240,000 events each year of which 110,000 are exclusive, and they have more than 650 long-term partnerships with sports leagues and sportsbooks.

Their operations were sourced from the SEC 4K below. Look specifically at pages 154-170 and 205-221 for the business and products.

[https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-010240/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-010240/)

**Sports Betting Outlook**

Sports betting hasn’t even come close to hitting its peak in the United States. In 2018, *Murphy v. NCAA* ruled that the federal government couldn’t make sports betting illegal; that decision was in violation of the 10th Amendment since those powers are not delegated to the Fed explicitly. Since then, [22 states have launched sports betting, 3 just had bills passed recently, and 22 have introduced bills](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization). That means that ***only 3 states have not attempted to legalize sports betting in some capacity*****.** Everyone has been talking about the impending legalization of marijuana and which companies will skyrocket because of that, but sports betting is already here, and no one is talking about what the plays are outside of DKNG and PENN.

Sports betting is less morally gray than marijuana to politicians, so full US legalization of sports betting is literally a couple years away. Also unlike the marijuana industry, sports data companies have already been established and operating in the legal sector for some time. There’s more to sports data than just sports betting. NFL nerds like myself can browse Football Reference for hours and look at OJ Simpson’s stats from his 2,000 yards season. Pro Football Focus has revolutionized the NFL with analytics. Genius Sports distributes stats for FIBA and has their media department.

Live betting has been seeing an increase in popularity and is actually more popular than pregame betting, especially in Europe. For this reason, it’s crucial that the data is as accurate, fast, and reliable as possible. Most of the states that legalize betting also legalize mobile betting, meaning that people can bet all day every day from their phone. In-game betting is huge and is expected to grow in the US much like it has in Europe. I’m unable to find the source, but I’ve read that roughly 60% of bets placed in Europe are live bets. Genius Sports gets a cut of each wager placed, which means the more live bets taking place means more money for GENI.

**Consistent Customers**

Genius Sports has only lost one customer in their history, and that customer ended up coming back to them. They always seem to be in the headlines for acquiring new deals. Recently they partnered with [Major League Rugby](https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/genius-sports-betting/) to be their data distributor, acquired [FanHub](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genius-sports-acquires-fanhub-leading-110000827.html) for the media solutions, and signed a deal with the NFL.

GENI has a habit of signing contracts with customers for a minimum of 4-5 years, but sometimes longer. Their deal with NCAA is for 10 years and was signed in 2018. In 2019 they signed with FIBA for 15 years. Their contracts have guaranteed minimums with escalators as well.

Most exciting and the cherry on top for Genius Sports is the aforementioned [deal with the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) to be their exclusive data distributor. The NFL dominates ratings, as Monday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, and Thursday Night Football were the [top 3 most popular series](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2019-2020-season-masked-singer-last-dance-1234612885/) according to TV ratings. Oftentimes a random Thursday Night Football game will have higher ratings than games from the NHL Finals, World Series, and NBA Finals. 

The fact of the matter is that the NFL is king when it comes to viewership, and Genius is set to capitalize. Additionally, part of the NFL deal was that the NFL would get an equity stake, so it’s in the league’s best financial interest that Genius Sports also does well financially. Making this an even sweeter deal is that GENI’s main competitor, SportRadar, was the official provider of the NFL prior to this. In other words, Genius Sports was able to steal their biggest competitor’s big fish client right when the league has finally started to fully embrace betting.

**Financials**

Financially this company has room for improvement. They have $391M in assets but $530M in liabilities. However, this is for the 2020 year, and they’ve since gained extra capital from merging with DMYD and now being publicly listed. $350M of their liabilities are preferred securities, meaning that companies with equity stakes (like the NFL) are buying those special shares for a dividend. This isn’t a huge deal because those investors believe in Genius to stay afloat and grow, otherwise they wouldn’t expect a dividend.

According to the investor presentation linked above, they should now have a debt free balance sheet upon completion of their merger with DMYD. GENI’s upcoming earnings report will be big to see if that is actually true. In 2019 they reported an EPS of -0.23. I can’t find EPS for 2020, but their EPS in Q4 2020 was -0.08, so I’d have to imagine that they did slightly worse.

They reported positive EBITDA of 8% this last year, and they’re projecting an EBITDA margin of 18% for 2021 and 29% for the 2022 fiscal years. Additionally, revenue is fast increasing, as their 2020 revenue of $149M was a [30% increase](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/) of $114M the year prior. Considering they were able to increase revenue in a year where sports practically didn’t exist for a quarter of the year, this is wildly impressive. Genius believes that a 30% CAGR is more than doable, and they expect revenue to be $190M in 2021 and $238M in 2022. DKNG won’t be profitable for a few years *at least*, but profitability is right around the corner for GENI.

It must be noted that the numbers in the above paragraph are from their investor presentation which was released ***before their deal with the NFL***. 

**Valuation**

I’m not great at valuation, but if someone else is please feel free to chime in. For what it’s worth, Simply Wall Street says that this company is priced [roughly at fair valuation](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-geni/genius-sports#valuation). Additionally, analysts have set price targets anywhere from [$25-30](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GENI/research-ratings). This is probably flawed logic, but if DraftKings is roughly $55 a share right now with a market cap of $22 billion, I gotta imagine the company that they rely on for their product is worth more than $3.73 billion. In fact, according to Niccolo de Masi, CEO of dMY Technology (the company GENI merged with to go public), DraftKings listed in their prospectus that Genius Sports going out of business is a risk factor.

**Bear Cases**

There are a handful of risk factors, and most importantly is that they have one main competitor in SportRadar. As stated earlier, Genius provides data for 40% of sportsbooks. SportRadar provides another 40% of the books with data, and the remaining 20% is split among a handful of other companies. SportRadar mainly does data for the NHL, NASCAR, and NBA (for which they have exclusive rights). 

SportRadar runs Cleaning the Glass, Sports Reference, and Stat Head, websites where you can look at stats dating back to the inception of each league (really cool stuff if you’re into that). With that being said, I believe there’s room for two companies even though they’re competitors, which is a thought that de Masi also backs. SportRadar is rumored to merge with HZON, and full disclosure I do own only a small position as it’s not actually official yet.

As with anything, the Fed could decide they don’t like it and make it illegal. I believe that to be unlikely, as sports betting provides a great amount of revenue for the State, and the government more than likely will take any extra avenue of money considering all the cash recently printed.

Financially they’re not exactly the most sound at the moment, so that risk is obviously there. A downside to their deal with the NFL is that it’s pretty damn expensive: $120M a year. Half of that will be paid through equity, so Genius is really paying $60M a year. A value investor (which I mainly try to be) would look at GENI’s balance sheet and free cash flow and say “no thanks”. 

I believe the opportunity for huge growth is so great that I can’t resist. Profitability looks like it’s around the corner. Plus, if I”m gonna sports gamble I may as well invest in what I’m losing my money in.

If you have anything to add, any questions or critique about my DD (this is my first one), I’d love to hear it. If I’m flat out wrong about something, please correct me, especially when it comes to explaining the financial stuff.

I’d also love to hear other sports betting stocks of interest. Thanks, and let’s make money from sports gambling.

**tldr;** Sportsbooks such as DraftKings, Bet365, FanDuel and more outsource all of the sportsbooks lines. When you bet against “Vegas” in sports, international basketball, the NFL, March Madness and more, you’re actually betting on the lines provided by GENI. Sports betting is being legalized rapidly, and GENI is the pick and shovels for the industry. I’m shook this hasn’t been getting more coverage, either here or from the general media.

n5gg3f,,stocks,post,1620222811,"The 6 phase model of how this uranium bull market might unfoldThe recent run up in equities has people questioning if they missed the top, if they are too late and if this was already the end of a young bull market in uranium. This couldn’t be further from the truth, as a long term price per pound of uranium is still in need of between 50 and 60 dollars. If it doesn’t reach this target within the next three years, we are in for much bigger issues and this will not be allowed to happen in my view. As part of the research document I wrote on uranium investing, I constructed a phase model that walks us through every part of what I think will be a generational bull market. We are very much still in phase 2 of my 6 phase model, but with phase 3 slowly emerging on the horizon. What are these 6 phases you might think? They can be categorized as follows in a stadium like model:

Phase 1, constructing the stadium (2016-2020):

\- The early/smart money, the first time we come out of a prolonged bear market. Equities may not have really moved yet, but it is finally starting to look brighter. After the price of uranium bottomed several years ago, it has crept up slowly but surely, but without proper reaction of the underlying equities. Catalysts are building and around the end of this phase (between July and October of last year) is when I first started sharing my due diligence on here. This phase ended at the start of the first big run up we have seen.

Phase 2, getting on the bus (2020-2021):

\- Once share prices finally move (as we have seen between November and February of this year), it is time for more of the smart money to come in. Those who see that we have finally come out of a bear market and that the busses are slowly being loaded. Price movement will justify the narrative and sharp minds accounting for both retail capital as well as institutional capital will start to position themselves for what is to come. This is the point where we are currently at, waiting for the next move up and for this bus to get going.

Phase 3, arriving at the stadium:

\- Word is spreading of a new investment opportunity and this will likely be marked by the price per pound of uranium going over the 40 dollar mark. As was mentioned above, price movement justifies the narrative and 40 dollar is the first ‘line in the sand’ where we will see increased interest from institutional capital wanting to position themselves for this bull market. This phase can be the shortest or the longest of all of the 6 phases depending on a number of key factors that need to be paid close attention to.

Phase 4, the game begins:

\- This is where the bulk of investors will come in. While we are not early anymore, we are well into this bull market and it still has some legs left. Some people might start taking profits here and leave before the game ends. This can be a smart plan, as scaling out into strength will save you from being hit by phase 6 once it rolls around. In this phase it is clear we are in a full-fledged bull market and it will become more and more regularly discussed by investment communities. Institutional money will be well positioned at this point and will look for a possible exit. I am currently writing an exit strategy on it, based both on history, market psychology and asset valuations. I am not able to share this, as it wouldn’t be fair to my platform, so I apologize for that. This phase will likely be the most volatile as a whole.

Phase 5, the final minutes:

\- As with every highly cyclical bull market, all good things most come to an end. Just like with a game that is all tied a few minutes before the final whistle, emotions are running high and you will see people scrambling to get a glance at the game. This is when general media such as CNBC and investors on social media will be talking about uranium as being “the next big thing”. This is a massive red flag. Yes, you might want to watch this game till the end, but it is much better to try and get out before the mass euphoria reaches its peak. When you see that uranium is as broadly discussed as things like digital meme dogs or EV's for example are right now and spot price severely overshooting the long term price, there is no reason to not take out most of your profits and watch this game go into phase 6.

Phase 6, the game ends (2025):

\- As I said before, all cyclical bull markets must eventually come to an end and this one will be no different. While the timing of this, which I think will be somewhere around 2025, is nothing more than a calculated bet (it could be longer, but also shorter, depending on prevailing market specific but also broad equity market circumstances), fact remains that the final blow off peak we saw in phase 5 in the final minutes of the game will be just as steep to the downside. This will leave a lot of people holding the bag and it will be a rough wake up call, don’t be left standing when the doors close and the lights go out.

Conclusion:

When a game is exciting, you want to stay till the end to make sure you don’t miss anything, this is very understandable as it is human nature to want to get the most out of something. However, the risk associated with trying to time the whistle to the minute is not worth it in my opinion. This doesn’t mean you should sell before the bus even arrives at the stadium, but perhaps it is smart to consider scaling out every few minutes and leave only a very small position (or nothing at all of course) to watch the final minutes of this game. Phases and associated timelines can shift very quickly, so make sure you are adaptive, patient and disciplined, because this will be quite the game and no one will know how long it will last. It could be 4 years, but it could also only be 1 or 2. You have to be adaptive and make sure you have the right information and strategy to make the most of this opportunity.

> It serves end users, such as integrated oil, chemical/petrochemical, automobile, steel, glass, construction, smelting, cleanroom, janitorial, pharmaceutical, and high technology electronics manufacturers, as well as scientific, medical laboratories, and the utilities industry; and federal, state, and local governmental agencies and departments.

The company has beaten earnings consensus estimates for the past 4 quarters (sometimes by pretty huge margins, e.g. more than double, triple, or even quadruple the earnings estimates), and revenues and earnings have been steadily rising for the past 4 years (with a big spike in both in 2021). Price to earnings is an impressive 6.34, and price/book is a very respectable 1.85. The stock peaked in February and just under $41, and is now trading at $27.31 (as of May 5th, 2021). The average analyst price target is $40.

I wonder if $LAKE could also benefit from potential infrastructure spending, as most of the jobs created will require some sort of protective clothing or gear. Already the stock seems undervalued, but with this potential boost, it could be primed for further growth.

I'm a very new investor, so I wanted to post my thought process to see if it seems logical to others, and to make others aware of this potentially undervalued company. Any thoughts or comments would be very welcome!

**EDIT:**

With help from the comments from others on this post and a bit more thinking, of course, $LAKE posted massive profits in 2020 because of COVID, since they provide protective equipment. The surge in need for PPE likely drove their earnings. Increased demand for protective clothing in infrastructure industries might offer some revenue, but it likely will not have nearly as large an effect as COVID and the need for PPE.

Investors have probably realized this, and given that lockdowns are winding down and vaccines are getting out there, they're thinking about the forward projected earnings per share, and not the outlier earnings of 2020. I'll hold off on $LAKE for now.",

n5xfd4,,stocks,post,1620269267,"STAG Industrial could be acquired/merged soon?STAG is one of the best Industrial REITs in the US and although it’s a bit bigger than MNR in terms of Market Cap, it’s been trading at a significant discount when we look at its Price/FFO of 18.3x (15.8x 5y avg) against the sector (28x). STAG (and MNR as well) grows its dividend very slowly unlike other players in the sector and that might be one of the reasons for a lower Price/FFO.

STAG’s FFO growth is pretty impressive (FFO/Share not as much), debt to assets ratio is conservative at 38.9%, payout at 75.9%.

The merger news between EQC and MNR could signal that maybe STAG Industrial will be part of a similar transaction in the near future? What do you think there’s a premium on STAG’s yield, is it only the dividend growth or the secondary property locations?

**tldr;** Drone Delivery Canada isn’t here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has many use cases and a lot of revenue potential. It is currently an unprofitable growth stock that seems very promising. At $1.33 (CAD) this is a buy and I have a price target of $6.87 5 years out based on a 10 price to sales ratio.

&#x200B;

*All numbers are in Canadian Dollars unless mentioned otherwise*

**Basic Stats: - (as of May 4, 2021)**

Price: $1.33

Market Cap: 279.38M

EPS: -0.08

Float: 209.61M

&#x200B;

**Description**

Drone Delivery Canada (DDC) provides a drone delivery platform targeted towards various corporations including retailers, service organizations and government agencies and are capable of transporting up to 180kg over 200kms. They have a patented hardware/software platform. DDC has been developing its drone delivery technology since 2014. They are currently trading on the TSX.V Exchange under the symbol FLT, on the U.S. OTC Q B market with Nasdaq International Designation under the symbol TAKOF. As a venture company that is not profitable it is a risky investment but there are many upsides to investing in this innovative technology.

&#x200B;

**Financials**

The company has reported assets worth $29M and $2.27M worth of liabilities so there is currently little worry of insolvency. With $23.4M in cash and yearly operating expenses of $14.5M, assuming no change, the company can operate with no financing for 1.6 years. This isn’t much of a worry due to increasing revenue and ease of financing.

2020 revenue was $265k and their total operating expenditure was $14.5M totaling a loss of $0.08 per share in 2020. Operating expense dropped in 2020, some key differences is an increase in advertising and marketing spend, a reduction in consulting expenditure, and an increase in personnel expenses. Research and development expenditure was almost the same which is good to see as they are still investing heavily in their technology.

Analyst estimate 2021 revenue of $6.59M which is over 2000% increase. While it is also expected for operating expenses to increase it’s good to see extreme revenue growth to match their high valuation of 271M. The current price/sales ratio is 1,021, assuming the same stock price and sales of $6.59M the price/sales ratio decreases to 41 which is much more reasonable, though realistically share price will increase this year. But even at twice the share price the price/sales ratio is 82 (which is still very high but much more reasonable than current, goes to show markets value future earnings). 2021 estimated EPS is -0.05 and profitability is expected in 2022.

The last thing to point out in DDC’s financial statements in they continue to invest heavily in patents. $140k in spent on patenting and trademarks in 2020 and $221k in 2019. With patents worth $750k as of December 31, 2020.

&#x200B;

**Ownership and Leadership**

0.2% of shares are held by private companies, 0.48% by individual insiders, 7.08% by institutions and the rest by the general public. The low insider holding is often seen as a bearish factor, but the low institutional holding can hold potential upside as once the stock is up listed, we can see large purchases as companies start adding shares to funds.

Leadership:

The CEO Michael Zahra has been the President of Staples Business Advantage (B2B supplies), the president of Yahoo, and has been on the board of directors for Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust and on the board of governors for North York General Hospital. So, while this is a start-up, they have a veteran leader. They have a strong lineup of C-Suite executives with experienced CFO and CTO. On top of this their board of advisors include the VP of Cargo at Air Canada, and a medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine which is an important strategic piece. The downside of their leadership is they have very high salaries for a company not making any profit.

&#x200B;

**Current Factors**

These are 3 current small factors that are worth mentioning

Partnership with DSV:

DDC entered in an agreement with DSV through its sales agent Air Canada that provides its drone delivery platform back in October 2019. The program became operational in March which was big for DDC as it is their first source of revenue. In which customers pay DDC a monthly fee for each drone route deployed. DSV provides and manages supply chain solutions for thousands of corporations. Which is a perfect partner for DDC. The initial agreement is for 15 months, with additional 1-year terms following the success of the first agreement.

Partnership with Edmonton Airport:

This partnership creates the world’s first airport drone delivery hub at Edmonton Airport using DDC’s platform. DDC and Edmonton airport will implement promote and market DDC’s delivery services. The agreement is for 5 years initially with the possibility of an extension unless the agreement is terminated

Patents:

DDC currently holds two US patents, one for its “FLYTE management” and one that covers aspects of its drone delivery technology and processes relating to controlled access zones for UAV landing and takeoff

&#x200B;

**Future Use Cases and Catalysts**

Medical Response:

In 2019 researchers tested the speed of drones vs the speed of ambulances to respond to a 911 call. The drone carried an AED to the location which was approx. 8km away. The drone was allowed to fly at speeds of 80km/hr and arrived at the scene an average of three to four minutes before the ambulance. Those few minutes could make a life or death difference in a cardiac arrest patient’s outcome. This is why having the medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine on the board of advisors could be a key to implementing their services to the medical field in the future.

US Expansion:

DDC has expressed their intention to expand to the United States in the past, which is in line with them filing US patents. Expanding into the US will open tons of new opportunities for them but will also be a large challenge.

Potential to move to TSX:

Moving up from the venture exchange to the TSX can pose many benefits. A big one that we care about is increase in share price. “An observation of 34 companies that graduated between October 14, 2005 and August 10, 2006, found that almost sixty per cent of the companies had an average share price over the thirty trading days post-graduation that was higher than the thirty trading days preceding graduation. On average, the share price of all 34 issuers went up over three per cent in that time frame, with four companies showing an increase of over 25 per cent”.

&#x200B;

**Market Size**

In Ark Invest’s *BIG IDEAS 2021* report they talked about the delivery drone market. They predict that drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD50 billion in revenues, USD14 billion in hardware sales, and USD3 billion in mapping revenues by 2025. And by 2030 drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD275 billion in revenues, USD50 billion in hardware sales, and USD12 billion in mapping revenues.

For a total market cap of $67B USD by 2025 and $337B USD by 2030.

&#x200B;

**Air Canada Cargo Partnership**

In Canada, 150K routes have been identified with their partner Air Canada Cargo. DDC’s revenue per route is $10,000/month. They are not even close to operating 150K routes so let’s start with 100 routes and build up.

|**Routes**|**Revenue/month**|**Yearly Revenue**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|100|$1M|$12M|
|1,000|$12M|$144M|
|10,000|$120M|$1.44B|
|25,000|$250M|$3B|
|150,000|$1.5B|$18B|

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Now let’s take that estimated yearly revenue and calculate share price based off price/sales ratio (assuming a 10x p/s which is a lot lower than current p/s).

|**Yearly Revenue**|**Market Cap**|**Share Price**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$12M| 120M|$0.57|
|$144M|1.44B|$6.87|
|$1.44B|$7.2B\*|$34.35|
|$3B|$15B\*|$71.56|
|$18B|36B\*\*|$171.74|

^(\*reduced P/S ratio to 5)

^(\*\*reduced P/S ratio to 2)

It’s important to note that the bottom 3 numbers are highly unrealistic in the next 5-10 years and require perfect execution and market factors to reach that point even past 10 years. A more realistic target would be a share price of $6.87 5 years out (furthest out analyst prediction is $116.8M of revenue 4 years from now). This is assuming a 10x p/s which aligns for an emerging technology company. A 5 year prediction of 120M in revenue is also falls in line with the previously mentioned $67B drone delivery market size by 2025 predicted by Ark Invest.

A $6.87 price estimate 5 years out at present value, assuming an 8% return found in index funds, equals $4.61.

&#x200B;

**Bear Case(s)**

Currently DDC is fitted for serving remote areas as there is a lot of regulation surrounding flying drones in urban areas. It’s also unrealistic to have dozens of drones flying around a city anywhere in the near future We need to see a shift in regulation for this to really take off. Big players such as Amazon and FedEx have been investing in delivery drone technology for years and most likely have very developed technology and infrastructure too. This does leave potential for a buyout if a company is trying to catch up to its competitors who have been investing in drone delivery. While financing will be relatively simple for this company this poses the risk of share dilution as they continue to spend money on research, patents, and other the expenses the company will need to sell more shares for cash flow.Lastly, their technology currently only allows delivery on predetermined routes that are from point A to point B and require a launch and landing pad so more technological development needs to happen.

&#x200B;

This technology isn’t here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has a lot of different use cases now and will have more in the future.

My question is what evidence do we have to establish an independence between different days (or any time frame) of the stock market? I commonly see people say ""only buy on a red day."" Assuming different days are independent events, this is an example of the Gambler's Fallacy. However, if a day's performance is dependent on previous days, there could in fact be guidelines to follow for when to buy/sell.

Assuming a simple game of flip a coin with 50% chance of winning, and that you can increase the bet each time with no limitation on sizing or how many times you can play, you WILL eventually win. You can generalise this with games of known but smaller probability of winning. But there is usually a practical limitation in that even if you have practically infinite funds, there is usually a maximum bet limit so you can't actually apply this strategy without significant risk.

In the stock market, first the probabilities aren't fixed or even known, assuming that each time you bet on a *trully* random stock, then you can probably get a half decent estimate from recent previous performance of the stock market. But still sentiment can change at any time, therefore making estimation useless. What is even further worse is if you do it with one stock, since it is even more dependent on the underlying business the details of which are unknown as well as general markets sentiment AND sentiment in the people who are trading the particular stock.

There's nothing wrong with going heavy in ETFs. In fact, most investors should probably be 100% in index ETFs. A total world stock ETF (VT) is a great foundation and I think you should put the vast majority of your money into it. No one can predict the future, so own the world. I wouldn't put more than 25% into these popular thematic ETFs that keep springing up on Reddit. They're unlikely to outperform over the long term.",

If you just want to set and forget it, then wide market ETFs are a good bet to just leave sitting there and accrue value over time while you pick up some minor dividend payouts every few months along the way.

I'd go 40/60 on Stocks/ETFs if you wanna be safe about it, reverse it if you want to be more active with trading and whatnot. I'd also recommend making sure you have enough for your emergency fund/monthly expenses on hand. Once you establish that, feel free to put your leftovers into ETFs and just sit.

Right now their cost per share is 200.30$

Lowe's Companies pays an annual dividend of $2.40 per share, with a dividend yield of 1.20%. ... Lowe's Companies pays out 41.96% of its earnings out as a dividend.

So at a cost of 200.30$, you're only getting 2.40$ back every 3 months? You would have to own a very significant amount of shares to make this worth while, no?

n5uzz3,,stocks,post,1620261328,"Teladoc Stock is Down Another 8% This Week. Don’t Just Blame Poor Earnings.""The stock has been under pressure for the past few months since the firm signaled that it [expects little membership growth in 2021](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teladoc-stock-falls-on-downbeat-forecast-for-membership-51614267007?mod=article_inline). A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

That being said, Teledoc was one of the first entrants but was unable to take advantage of their position.

n5lec2,,stocks,post,1620235480,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor  
**Resolution 2:** I made 3 copies of the sheet in hopes of spreading out the odds of getting in  
   [Copy 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_UjmNI7Zxm76QN3HQ-_cwx3lZ8QbTogyqYTY1oRC9E/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDRkAGtRrXql5RQ-l68cD5lE3XoBMNv3oJsHb_3JK38/edit?usp=sharing)
3. **Resolution 3:** I published them to the web for those that can't get into the files themselves

4. **Resolution 4:** Create downloadable Excel copies. These are locked in at 05/05/21 so won't be updated after that, but I left instructions to update it yourself

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

A great stWhy do you invest in Stocks? Yes of course for money…but why? I am looking for the emotional answers. The real deep down reasons. A great story!

The question seems to have obvious answers, like ""to grow my money!"" or ""to be wealthy!"" If we could avoid those answers just for this topic. 

But I am looking for the emotional why, the real reason why people want to invest or grow their money. During these times it seems like there is always another hidden layer…

- Do you invest to protect your future, so you can retire comfortably?
- Do you want to make sure you have the money to pay for your child's education?
- Do you want to prepare for possible sickness and hospital bills when you are old?
- Do you want to travel, see the world, enjoy luxuries?
- Do you just want to escape the rat race and have the option to do what you want to do?

My emotional why, is to give my family a better future. To be able to afford a home where we can grow together and of course stop having to pay rent. 

What is your emotional why? I would love to hear from all of you. Feel free to DM me if you do not want to answer publicly.",

Long-Term I really like the stock b/c of the TAM, Growth, and the future of plant-based meats.

With a $8 billion market cap, I can easily see this 10X within 5-10 years.

People are starting to eat healthier and I am betting on Ethan Brown a visionary CEO to do this.

While there may be competition they have partnerships with YUM Brands, McDonalds, PepsiCo, and others. This gives them quite the competitive advantage going forward.  They’re trying to dominate locally and then expand which is the smartest idea.

Half of the food Americans eat is takeout and I believe that if we go through some sort of frugal decade people in general wil start to eat more healthier and start to be more conscious of what they eat

Even if this is not the case, BYND will be in McDonalds and those big branded restaurants so people will have the choice to order from them. 

Think about it like this: How many times have you gone to McDonalds or fast food and thought to yourself “ I feel guilty for ordering this Big Mac or this disgusting chicken sandwhich”.

I'm an average joe. I don't do options, period.

Turns out it's a one-click thing and they gave me a boat load of margin. I have sense to use it responsibly.

The ONLY thing I want to use margin for is so that I can keep my cash 100% in the market but be able to ""buy dips"" and strategize (if you could call it that). And before I get recommendations not to have all of my cash in the market, I don't. I have a healthy emergency fund. It's just not through TD.

Uber sets aside $600 million for U.K. drivers as a result of court findinghttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-investors-finally-see-the-costs-of-treating-drivers-as-employees-and-the-stock-is-falling-11620265604

Uber Technologies Inc. has spent and fought to keep its drivers from becoming classified as employees instead of contractors, and investors finally got a glimpse of the financial reasons on Wednesday.

Uber UBER, -3.42% broke out $600 million from its total revenue of $3.5 billion to account “for the resolution of historical claims in the U.K. relating to the classification of drivers” in its first-quarter earnings results. That is a direct result of a U.K. Supreme Court ruling in March that led Uber to classify tens of thousands of drivers in the U.K. as employees.

Uber disclosed in March that it could have to pay claims of back pay due from British drivers in the case, including holiday pay, wages to equal the minimum and, potentially, pension contributions. That would be on top of what the company already paid the drivers in the 2016 case.

That puts a dollar figure on a longstanding concern about Uber and the other “gig work” companies — what it would look like financially if they had to treat drivers as employees. And it is nothing to sneeze at, blowing away the $200 million Uber and other gig companies spent to pass a new law in California in their quest for a “third way” for employment law. That win could be moot, though, as President Joe Biden’s new secretary of the Labor Department said last week drivers should receive the benefits of employment in most cases, spooking some investors.

For more: Here is how the Biden administration could change gig work

Uber shares initially went higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company papered over the “accrual” and continuing losses with the $1.6 billion sale of its self-driving unit, but fell back to a 4.8% decline in the extended session as executives discussed increasing costs for drivers and faced an immediate question about Labor Secretary Marty Walsh’s comments.

“When we look at the makeup of the current administration, it’s fair to say that there are individuals who have varying views on these issues. They’re not all identical in their outlook. And we think that creates space for some meaningful dialogue,” said Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West, who worked in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama.

The company’s standard mantra when asked about the possible costs of classifying its drivers as employees has been to say that they will pass on the costs to its users, which executives said again during Wednesday’s call. They noted that they did see a slight increase in costs in the quarter, because of driver benefits, and they were able to pass those costs on to riders, with no impact on demand.

See also: Uber and Lyft are public, so the cheap rides are coming to an end

“We are leaning in, with investments to support the recovery mobility and growth initiatives and delivery,” said Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, noting that the ride-hailing company plans to invest in its driver base, and increase its spending in general, marketing and administrative costs, and in R&D. Chai estimated Uber will spend between $450 million and $480 million in the second quarter, after a drop in spending last quarter. Also included will be spending on marketing to attract new drivers, as it faces driver shortages in the U.S. and Mexico.

At the same time, Chai noted that the company continues to face “significant forecasting uncertainty and predicting posts reopening consumer behavior.”

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said that investors were not happy with the higher spending, and pointed to the U.K. charge/accrual as highlighting the hot-button issue of possible further regulation over the classification of its drivers.

“Higher level of investments near term, coupled with some uncertainty around the forecast,” were affecting the shares in after-hours trading, Ives said in an email. “It was a robust print, but after the Biden move against gig players, the Street is very nervous around Uber and Lyft, with selling post-quarter a theme commonplace during tech earnings season.”

Even so, investors now have an idea of how much drivers being classified as employees could cost the company. As the debate over gig workers continues, investors will likely remain jittery about the issue. The nagging question above all is, will companies like Uber and Lyft Inc. LYFT, -6.34% ever be profitable, with their contractor business models again at risk, and prone to big, unexpected costs?",

Tech earnings are receiving all the hype recently, and if you guys are like me, you’re looking for stocks to get into at low prices, and ride out the growth (we’re all aiming for the next TSLA). While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.","['TSLA', 'MMM']"

>  
>Peloton recalled its Peloton Tread+ and Peloton Tread treadmills today, according to an [announcement from the Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury), the government agency that oversees most household products, citing safety hazards.  
>  
>The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”  
>  
>**The company also notified the CPSC that its newer Peloton Tread’s touch screen can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.**  
>  
>**Consumers should immediately stop using the treadmills and** [**contact Peloton for a full refund**](https://www.onepeloton.com/)**.**  
>  
>**The Peloton Tread+ (previously named the Peloton Tread) has been on the market since 2018. A smaller treadmill, also named the Peloton Tread, was slated to go on sale May 27, with 1,000 units already sold in the U.S. as part of a friends-and-family presale.**   
>  
>The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
>  
>**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
>  
>In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.   
>  
>The treadmill’s safety risks first became apparent in March after [Peloton CEO John Foley wrote to](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-) users of the exercise machines regarding an incident with the Peloton Tread+ that led to the death of a child. Foley advised consumers to “keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times” and to “remove the safety key and store it out of reach of children” when the treadmill was not in use.  
>  
>The widely publicized fatality prompted the CPSC to request information from Peloton, and the company disclosed to the agency that there were additional injuries and incidents tied to the Peloton Tread+.  
>  
>**As the CPSC investigated the reports, including disturbing** [**home video footage of a child being sucked underneath the Peloton Tread+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) **(and escaping without serious injury), the agency asked Peloton to recall its treadmills. But Peloton refused.**  
>  
>Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
>  
>The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
>  
>“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
>  
>Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
>  
>**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families. I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”**

His comments on leaving money to his wife in the SP500 instead of Berkshire seem interesting to me. I imagine most of his money is currently in Berkshire. He nearly always says that he thinks Berkshire is amazing and that index funds are great for most people. If he believed in Berkshire's future once he and Charlie are no longer at the helm, wouldn't it make more sense to put leave the money within Berkshire?

Does it make sense to invest in Berkshire for the long term based on his comments versus an index fund?",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['BRK.B', 'KO', 'SPGI']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

n5yd5o,,investing,post,1620272502,"Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?Hi r/investing,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

n5yd5o,gx5iiqs,investing,comment,1620310822,"Approving the comment but with some guidance:  Even though the stock is undervalued, I encourage you to come to the table with a more thorough analysis.  A thorough discussion of valuation is going to do more than look at various ratios of earnings.  For example:

1. What's the FCF-based fair value?
2. What's the delta of Ford's forward P/E in each of the past five quarters to its actual P/E?  In other words, how much did positive earnings materialize into stock price appreciation?
3. What is the historical and forward P/E comparison to Ford's peers?  The automotive industry is exceptionally capital intensive with not staggeringly high margins.
4. What are the risk factors unique to the automotive industry?  Investors have been as shy of automotive stocks as they have been of airline stocks, two industries that required a LOT of public subsidy over the past five decades, and are now facing a transformation challenge: spurred on by the $2 billion settlement of VW AG over its emissions scandals, automotive makers have an incentive to convert their production to EV's but at what cost?  Is Ford ahead or behind its peers in this regard?
5. There's not a lot in their financial statements that looks glaringly bad (some commentary on non cash items, discontinued operations and capital lease obligations is welcome but not materially significant) but a few things should be at least commented on including that three of the past five quarters they posted a net operating loss... Granted, that owes to the pandemic but when we look at history, even before the pandemic the stock price never rose above $14 per share and hovered for quite a while around $10, currently trading at $11.5399.  So the market's not really moved the price even remotely close to the FCF fair value in the last half decade... What implications might that have for the expected return?  That may or may not matter depending on the type of value investor you're pitching the question to, but it's got to be addressed so they can weigh it.

There are, I'm sure, many other questions that can be raised if given more than the five or six minutes I glanced at the company's data... This is just an example of the kind of questions you should anticipate.",

A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.

'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

There is small revenue, but it just begun growing.  The question how to measure  potential revenue in the next 5 years, and try to estimate reasonable  growth expectations, so I can come up with reasonable valuation.  Was  wandering if anyone came across a case study, or earnings projection  report that is well written and has proven accurate that I can model  against?

\-I believe a report like  that should cover some way to measure demand.  Which maybe part of the  market and if that market is growing.  
\- Maybe a comparable to analyze its growth against another company either in the same or adjacent segment.

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

n5pzhd,gx3n848,investing,comment,1620265210,"Great question. Rocket is a solid company putting up impressive numbers. The company is giving conservative guidance for next quarter, which is smart. If they guide high and miss, they get pounded. Better to guide lower and beat it next quarter.

Interest rates have ticked up, which MAY slow down the housing market. In reality, it won't hurt them long term. It's a strong company putting up profit numbers that others would love.

If you're a long term investor, it means the shares are now on sale. I expect them to blow out the estimates next quarter, but the real estate market for the rest of the year will be key. Management is making some very smart moves with their proprietary software, letting agents track loan progress (which will result in more agents recommending Rocket), and moving into auto loans. Long term this is still a very solid company, regardless of what happens this week. It might be a great opportunity to buy the dip during the next market correction.",

Originally, I thought I should have sold after doubling my money back when BTC hit ~$14k, but my friends talked me out of it. Now I’m in “I’ve made more money in one year of buying crypto than I did on my W2 last year” territory, and I’m starting to wonder (see: become nervous about) A. whether or not to sell at that point and B. if others share that principle.

A. Is obviously impossible for you all to answer, but I’m curious what types of principles you follow in terms of selling (Once I hit x multiple I decide to sell, once I hit y amount of savings I sell or will sell, etc). Doesn’t necessarily have to be crypto, either.

n5zwg9,gx4z7sn,investing,comment,1620300338,"I’ve made an absolute killing over the last 12 months, both in stocks and crypto. 

The kind of growth we’ve seen over the last year can be a huge boon for investors, but it’s not the new norm and cannot last. I’ve been transitioning a lot of my money out of high risk and more volatile investments such as individual stocks in hyped sectors and crypto into more traditional and stable investments, ie well diversified funds. I’m still going to keep a small portion of my portfolio in crypto, but for the most part I’m done trying to actively pick stocks and coins. I’m more lucky than smart, and I think the same is true for 99% of Reddit investors. I’d rather miss out on some potentially higher gains than lose everything I’ve made so far. 


I’m not trying to time the market, I’ve just come to the realization that I’m not comfortable with my risk level and I’m working to readjust it. However, I do have a sneaking suspicion that in a decade we’ll look at events like DOGE hitting $0.60-$1.00 (which I think is possible, albeit not tenable) the same we view the Pets.com craze: a clear sign of a deeply unhealthy market and irrational investor exuberance pushing speculative bubbles to their absolute limit, and that it was a canary in the mine that we all should have seen from a mile away but instead chose to ignore.",

n5w1a9,,investing,post,1620264703,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DDVista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",

n5lead,,investing,post,1620235477,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

n5jbxh,,investing,post,1620230375,"Limiting turnover in levered portfoliosAfter spending a bit too much time reading  ~~papers~~ marketing pieces from AQR, I'm fully convinced that a ""balanced portfolio"" (ie less stocks, more bonds and alts than the 100/0) levered up to the risk of stocks should beat the pants off everyone's favourite 100/0 while cutting the tails somewhat, even with realistic financing costs and transaction costs  (cursory look at Alpha Architect's ~~material~~ sales pitches for high turnover products)

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

Or am I missing something else entirely?",['ES']

This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

* We're in a frictionless vacuum, and cows are spherical

Then, the market portfolio is the best mean/variance portfolio: if a higher Sharpe ratio portfolio existed, then *everyone* would recognize this and use it, changing the prices in the market, making the portfolio worse than or equivalent to the market portfolio.

And if I wanted to invest in the market portfolio, I would buy a fractional share of the market, the components of which would then be weighted by their value in the market (their market capitalization)

&#x200B;

Is that all accurate? Are there points that should be changed?",

The idea is that the optimal portfolio will always be some fraction of the risk-free asset, and some fraction of the market portfolio. If your risk-tolerance is high enough, your investment in the market portfolio will be more than all your assets, so you'll be borrowing at the risk-free rate.

With no risk-free asset, there are multiple portfolios which may be optimal, depending on your risk-return tradeoff, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern\_portfolio\_theory#Efficient\_frontier\_with\_no\_risk-free\_asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory#Efficient_frontier_with_no_risk-free_asset)

* We've had an enormous amount of growth in the US markets since the election
* There doesn't seem to be any more 'new' good news on the horizon, and the expected good news has already been priced in, hence stocks not moving much on superb earnings
* Hints/concerns/worries about central bank exit strategies (as well as can be predicted, i.e. no new variants causing unexpected problems)
* Lots of market euphoria and no more safe havens to hedge to with everything being expensive and treasuries potentially having zero expected future returns under some models - this is includes the possibility that US markets themselves are only at the valuations they are because there doesn't seem to be anywhere else to put cash for any kind of return

I hope I'm wrong, I  but it made me nervous because I do have quite a bit of cash on hand (10k+) that I'm holding to find an investment opportunity. Here's what I found with a bit of research:

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?  If its entire attraction is its insane volatility how is it useful for its primary purported utility—currency—when it lacks the things a currency must have, namely stable store of value and standard of value (you're going to convert it back into a government backed security at some point)?",

Stock futures are mostly flat this morning. Tech is seeing a bit of selling, with the Nasdaq off 0.3%.

This follows a day of reopening optimism that lifted retail stocks. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will fully re-open on May 19. Florida is open effective immediately.

So the rotation trade is apparently back. Not much in the way of economic data today. Factory orders at 0830. We do have a bunch of earnings: CVS and DuPont just beat. Later we have Pfizer, Activision Blizzard, Akamai, and some oil majors: ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum, Dominion Energy, Devon Energy. 

Oil is up this morning, by the way. Crude up 1.8% to $65.50, another post-pandemic high.

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?","['AMZN', 'NKE', 'TGT', 'UNP', 'NVDA', 'HD', 'AAPL', 'HON', 'UNH', 'TSLA', 'DIS', 'DHR', 'TMO', 'NFLX', 'MSFT', 'ADBE', 'SPGI']"

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['AMD', 'AAPL', 'IP', 'INTC', 'TSLA']"

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful.

n3jkda,,investing,post,1620000972,"Retail Dragon Portfolio - Week 1 UpdateFirst weekly update on the Retail Dragon Portfolio. A new screenshot can be found [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jSahhfA).

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Chris Cole's Dragon Portfolio Allocations](https://imgur.com/gallery/0JVrDkm)
* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI']

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

n44y45,gwtm292,investing,comment,1620071767,"There's a lot of regulatory / political uncertainty surrounding GEO and the prison space right now. The Biden executive order has directed the DOJ to cease use of private facilities which is acting as a headwind to revenue and contract renewal rates. Losing the Bureau of Prison business via the executive order isn't that big of a deal, but it does represent ~$290MM of revenue rolling off between now and FYE2022. More concerning, however, was having the contract with the US Marshals canceled at the GEO Queens facility as this customer was viewed as far more sticky than the BOP. Losing the BOP revenue was always a matter of ""when"", not ""if"", but potentially losing the USMS in addition means GEO investors need to diligence how the company will navigate losing two of its top three customers.

Increasing chatter of reform at ICE layers in additional concerns as this is their largest customer, though it isn't clear to me how the USMS and ICE will rapidly move away from the industry with any degree of efficiency, particularly as COVID impacts on prison and ICE populations abate. While the asset value at GEO is robust, keep in mind there is limited use for these assets. A prison can't be converted into a shopping mall or a bowling alley, for example, and at GEO you have a lot of debt ahead the equity that would be paid out first in the event of a liquidation. While it likely makes sense for the government to solve the prison prison ""problem"" by buying these assets for public use given the constraints in the government prison system, for political reasons this may not happen.

Add on top of all of this is GEO's limited ability to tap capital markets due to ESG concerns (though this is a constantly moving line) + GEO's 2024 maturity wall and it doesn't strike me as a great equity story. Limited paths for growth, regulatory concerns, questionable access to capital, refi risk, etc, etc. Eliminating the dividend was a good first step but long over due. Given yield on GEO's debt I would prefer to buy the near term bonds than the equity.

Personally I like CoreCivic better than GEO. Less leverage, better story, less BOP risk, but neither strikes me as a compelling equity opportunity.

TLDR: tough equity story; this is not a ""down the fairway"" stock as it is borderline distressed; lots of revenue is rolling off and even more is at risk of rolling off in the future rendering current P/E metrics rather useless; limited opportunities for growth in general as prison populations have been in decline for years now",['ICE']

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile.

However, I’m not even sure your statement holds today, as we can easily flip it. We say we view growth as more risky, but how many people are throwing large investments into renewables or EVs?  The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth.

Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

However lately I’ve been wondering if I should just wait for a bear market and put aside my cash and wait to invest until that point.

I’m 30 years old (USA), recently unemployed due to a medical condition that means I can’t do my old job anymore. I have no idea when I’ll be able to work again in my field, if ever.

Right now, I have $285,000 available to invest (The rest of my savings is for bills, other expenses, etc) and I’m hoping I can invest it so I’ll at least be able to generate some income in the meantime. I have no holdings,  no debt, and no other huge expenses, I’m just unable to work for the foreseeable future.

Right now, my only objective for this money is to preserve what I have while hopefully make 8-10% a year (Before inflation). From what I’ve read, this seems doable without going crazy with risk (Please correct me if I’m wrong).

From my understanding, I’d assume I should just go pick a set of diversified 5-star large-cap ETFs that have generated the returns I’m looking for and hold indefinitely, is that the correct strategy? Like I said before, I’m not looking for crazy returns, just 8-10% would be enough for my needs.

Why not!? If you think inflation is going to keep climbing I don't see how the 30 year yield can remain low. 3% doesn't even represent a normal level of term spread even at low inflation levels. If inflation remains stable or continues to increase the 30 year yield has to continue going up just to maintain a positive expected return much less keep up with historical term spread.",

Well Powell keeps saying transitory rather than temporary because temporary implies it does away. Transitory means it is a one time bump. Once inflated the Fed and the treasury do not expect a decline in prices but lower future inflation.

I've been in gold and silver since last spring/summer. I don't think it will rise that much due to alternatives like crypto (which I sadly did not buy into last spring/summer), the strength of equities, and how bullish economies coming out of a recession tend for boom industrial materials/metals rather than defensive ones like silver/gold. Not saying it can't rise on inflation, but gold/silver are highly speculative so a strong global economy could offset the inflationary gains of precious metals.",

I had followed my CPAs advice a while back to use Money Market Funds in place of HYSA as the tax benefits are better for the former?

What if the market shifts, you put your dry powder in, and get a cancer diagnosis / lose your job / meteorite obliterates your house the next day?

I have my emergency ""oh shit"" money in a very boring savings account that I can access through my bank or ATM this instant.

I have a dry powder MM fund in both my taxable brokerage and in my IRAs, and I try to maintain some cash in them to take advantage of black swan events. Last March when the pandemic hit and WTI went negative I made a big move into USL that paid off handsomely.

How much you have in long term investments vs. how much you keep as dry powder really is up to individual temperament. Dry powder may not earn you much, but might be invaluable in taking advantage of black swan events. At the same time, if those black swan events don't come, that cash may be sitting in a MM earning fuck all. 

TL;DR - I was happy to have a shitload of cash available to take advantage of shifts due to the pandemic, but now we're back to ""normal"", everyone needs to make a personal judgement on how much powder to hold in cash/MM.

It reads as a lot of wishful thinking and arrogance. Where the hell do you place Apple, the largest company in the world growing 50%?  

Growth has outperformed value for 20 years, and the winners of the dot com crash , like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, have outperformed everything by a huge margin in the last 30 years. 

Either the valuation methods were good to use and it’s just that the type of company that wins the future has so much higher margins and network effects that the definition of key value metrics has to change, OR (like many here seem to suggest), somehow this will all “regress to the mean” and somehow Sysco, public enterprise group, and Cincinnati Financial (great companies I also own) will eventually outperform the other ones I mention?

It has nothing to do with finance and everything to do with business model. If you can’t understand how business has changed finance, then you will continue to underperform by relying on outdated financial discipline viewpoints.","['AMZN', 'CINF', 'SYY', 'AAPL', 'MSFT']"
n2fchi,gwj4qzf,investing,comment,1619869196,"Someone said this in 2011 about John Hussman: ""**Conflating his views of what should happen with what could happen.** He is the anti-David Tepper, **more concerned with the the violated rules of the game than with winning the game itself**."" (https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/The-Reformed-Broker/2011/0112/Mutual-fund-manager-apologizes-kind-of) This was in 2011 after Hussman spent the prior couple of years fighting the Fed and talking about how everything was a bubble. He then spent nearly the next 10 years fighting the fed (to the point of doing a petition against what the Fed was doing - in 2020: https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/john-hussman-is-literally-fighting-the-fed/a1376170) 

I think there are people who view growth with some degree of disdain, have this belief that ""anything above (fill in random low # p/e) is bubble/overvalued/etc"" and then they get upset/frustrated when those names go up for years on end (remaining too focused on all the reasons why they shouldn't and meanwhile, not focused on why they could and did.) For all their dislike and disinterest in investing in growth, they still manage to seem to be consistent and eager spectators and have an opinion on all the most popular names. 

If you are a ""value investor"" (unless you run a value fund, I don't know why you feel you have to strictly be a ""value investor"") it's been a frustrating decade topped off with the fact that in a pandemic aggressive growth had probably its best year since the dot com era, outperforming value (which one would have thought would have provided shelter from the storm, yet underperformed in the initial decline in March 2020 and then massively underperformed in the months after.)

That said, growth can absolutely become very frothy and I think did last year - it was completely a year of ""the more aggressive the growth story the better."" The kind of performance that aggressive growth had last year was in no way sustainable unless ""this time is very different."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly)

 Ultra low rates and an eagerness to chase anything ""disruptive"" lead to a year that probably won't be repeated any time soon. People invested in EVs like all the companies were going to be winners (https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html), despite the fact that the automobile industry has a very, very, very (very) long list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) of losers in its history. People were investing in shroom stocks as if shrooms were going to be in every produce section tomorrow. Battery company that wasn't going to have a product until 2025 bought up...until reality hits (and then on top of that it's called a fraud.) I think people get overly excited about a theme and then it's buy anything related at any price. Might still actually be a good long-term theme but where you bought it still matters: if you buy into short-term mania, you could still be a bagholder for a while when reality returns. 

The Ark ""collect 'em all"" posts got excessive and people calling Cathy Wood ""Money Tree"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree) might have been the top before the correction in Feb in Ark-y aggressive growth. Many growth names corrected significantly or very significantly in Feb-Mar, and it's interesting to see what's bounced and what has not as perhaps people have become more selective. If you see another ramp higher in rates, growth will pull back again. Will ""growth collapse""? I don't think so. Will nonsense eventually crater and excess cool off? Yes. Not everything in growth is in some sort of massive, speculative excess, although people like to paint it that way.

If you're still positioned for what did exceedingly well in 2020, you're probably not going to do as well in 2021. I don't think that things are going back to 2019 normal - covid seems as if it will be endemic so I think people have to invest in this sort of ""in-between"" where it's not the worst of the pandemic but a return to 2019 or close to it might be a long ways off. I think people should consider having a portion of their portfolio dedicated to a selected group of aggressive growth names they feel strongest about and a portion dedicated to higher quality - not necessarily boring/conservative, but slower, high quality growth that has demonstrated consistent results over the years. Real assets/inflation beneficiaries should also be considered.

This isn't ""anti-value"", although I think traditional value investing I think is very difficult in a world that seems to be increasingly focused on ""why is my stock down 1% in the last hour?!?!"", it's more: understand your strengths, don't create a lot of arbitrary rules (""Anything with p/e above 15 is too expensive"") - have some flexibility and give yourself a broad mandate so that you can be able to look for the broadest set of potential opportunities.",

High valuations *are* a good reason to expect lower future returns. Over the past decade, AAPL and MSFT have delivered excellent returns, but a significant part of those returns came from multiple expansion. That’s unlikely to repeat, and if interest rates rise, multiples will contract significantly. 

A decade ago, AAPL and MSFT *were* value stocks. People considered AAPL’s business model to be heavily reliant on the iPhone and it sold at a low P/E typical of a hardware manufacturer. MSFT was considered a dinosaur. Few were bullish on them like they are now.

Growth companies, *provided they’re purchased at a sensible price*, can absolutely deliver high returns.

1) Trends and market darlings die hard. So even if a company is overvalued, the most important aspect is that the brand is recognizable and so people are going to invest or do business with it. That means that if you buy in there is very likely to still be upswing left even if the company is somehow making all the wrong management decisions. So growth works even if you're late to the bandwagon.

2) Picking a value stock is like picking a favorite horse or home nfl draft dream team. Sure, on paper, everything may be perfectly aligned, but (repeat after me) the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. And sure P/E ratios and long views help, but you're still ultimately gambling that the crowd will eventually come to the same conclusion that you did to see any really strong uplift. And frankly, it's just hard to pick diamonds in the rough.

3) Look at any growth vs value comparison chart of the last 20 or so years and yes growth outperforms value, but they both track each other pretty well in the up markets. It's in the brief downturns where you see values greatly outperform growth, which again, I think is a logical outcome since everyone is panicking. So even though it wins the minority of the time, it wins when everyone is freaking out and so it gets this reputation as tried and true, default advice.",

A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['TSLA', 'TWTR', 'SPGI', 'DOW']"

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

They're in the alcoholic beverages industry, own vineyards, and produce a wide portfolio of wine brands sold in 50 countries. I'm a big fan of Decoy for producing cheaply priced but great tasting reds. 

They had their IPO last month and their price seems to be stabilizing after yoyoing between $16-20. Facts:

* Market Cap: $2.1b
* Shares: $18.58
* PEG: 0.01
* **PE: 0.04**

This seems like an absolute steal. Competitors in the beverages industry have an average PE of 32.5 and PEG of 0.05 (per TD Ameritrade analytics, anyway). Its a profitable company that has great margins.

The primary downside is their tiny market share in a competitive industry. In 2020, their total revenue was $270mil, versus the industry total of $326**bil** (0.08%).

Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA.

• Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.16 beats by $0.02; GAAP EPS of $0.08 beats by $0.10.

• Revenue of $1.04B (+28.8% Y/Y) beats by $10M.

• Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is 11% lower in early postmarket trading after first-quarter earnings showed a beat on profitability, but revenues and user numbers that were in line with expectations - a tough sell in a quarter of tech earnings blowouts.

• The company also offered subdued Q2 revenue guidance in line with expectations.

• Revenues rose 29% to $1.04B, largely as expected.

• Those gains reflected ""accelerating year-over-year growth in MAP revenue and brand advertising that improved throughout the quarter,"" says Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal. ""Advertisers continue to benefit from updated ad formats, improved measurement, and new brand safety controls, contributing to 32% year-over-year growth in ad revenue in Q1.""

n1i2a5,gwgp7qi,investing,comment,1619812504,"A lot of negative sentiment on TWTR in this thread. 10:1 ratio of negative comments? As expected since the stock is down +15% the last few weeks and down +25% from it's peak a few months ago. 

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']"
n1bg9z,,investing,post,1619722719,"Beijing’s Squeeze on Fragile Real-Estate Developers Is Getting Real - Wall Street Journal ArticleRead the article here: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-squeeze-on-fragile-real-estate-developers-is-getting-real-11619682390](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-squeeze-on-fragile-real-estate-developers-is-getting-real-11619682390)

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Quoting from Michael Pettis, who is always astute, and is a reasonably non-biased source on China's economy. [Read thread here](https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1387831939353153537).

>""Important article by [@Birdyword](https://twitter.com/Birdyword/), who discusses the shift from bank loans to buyers' deposits in the liabilities of Chinese property developers. As usual I'm especially interested in the balance-sheet impact: as long as things are going well, the shift barely matters, but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.  
>  
>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

>This process can be highly self-reinforcing as it forces property developers to cut back further on operations, and so alienate even more deposits. Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.  
>  
>Second, Beijing will have to choose either to let households take the loss or to force banks to step in and make them whole. The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.  
>  
>For many years we've seen that ""deleveraging"" in China has meant reducing leverage in one part of the economy while increasing it in another. This isn't incidental. It is fundamental to the way the growth model works. ""

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",

n13d9f,,investing,post,1619699725,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval ProcessWelcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make

n0k1xc,,investing,post,1619630884,"Why REITs Are in a position to outperform equities on a risk-adjusted basis1. The corporate tax hike will affect most corporations, but REITs are ""pass through"", so they will be unaffected by this as they do not pay corporate taxes.

2. The capital gains and qualified dividend tax hike won't affect REITs either, because they're already taxed as ordinary income(other than QBI deduction)

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

4. Real estate has historically done well during periods of inflation, and many leading indicators for inflation are present(High commodity prices, shortages, high demand, stimulus, M2 growth, unemployment dropping, rising inflation expectations)

5. REITs have yet to recover as much in share price as much as the equity market. While equities are trading at far higher P/E ratios than they were a year ago, REITs FFO to price ratios are still looking cheap.

6. If you look at 1999 when equities were starting to trade at similar P/E Ratios, REITs went on to perform well during the tech bubble crash up until the real estate bubble several years later.

7. Low interest rates present an opportunity for leveraged investment",

n1awok,,investing,post,1619721222,"Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings Apple is a great long term buy according to my opinion. My Portfolio is 100% Apple. I believe this company has so many more avenues to venture into and maintain healthy growth over the following decade. I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",['AAPL']

But this is the best and most important part? If you don't want to get into your DD then how about amusing me a bit with these questions:

* How do feel about the risk of weak returns since Brazil has been in a decade of economic down turn? Historically Brazil has had booms that market them look like they'll reach developed status only to bust back into developing status.

* Have you factored in the problems with inflation and continued currency weakness? US might be printing like crazy, but LatAm currencies are experiencing inflation not only against their own goods/services but also against the dollar.

* Are you factoring the various troubles of Bolsonaro government having immediate and long term impacts?

* How are you so sure those individual stocks will do so well? Investing in Brazil is already risky as is with it likely being outside the circle of competence of most people. The added individual stock picks only increases those risks. Why not invest in an ETF like EWZ?

* What makes you think that these Brazilian stocks or even a Brazilian ETF can outperform US stocks when historically speaking the US & S&P has beaten Brazil and the Brazilian top stocks in basically every time range be it 1yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, or 50yr?

We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”","['DE', 'WHR', 'PEP', 'TEL', 'CE', 'DOV', 'KO', 'SNA']"

Medicine? Stable companies like Roche or BMY. Maybe this could be a smart way to stabilize the portfolio?

Looking at how everything turned out, Reddit's prediction accuracy is pretty low if you ask me. **Every person working in the financial and I mean everyone, was expecting inflation to rise starting in March-April since last summer.** No one is surprised at all.

**Here is an advice, if you really want to grasp how persistent is inflation, you want to look at how high are the base effects,  companies can pass through the cost of higher inputs, what's the state of demand what is exactly pushing it and is it structural ? Can supply adapt quickly enough and do they have the capacity to adapt in the first place ?**

To answer all of this questions reading articles or opinions you pulled of Google News won't cut it. You need to look at actual data, numbers in a spreadsheet or Refinitiv/Bloomberg terminal something that gives you a macro view of the economy.

If you really believe that inflation is coming : idk short Treasuries and use the proceeds to buy TIPS. No one sane would do that, but if you're 100% sure that inflation is inevitable this is a safe move from your point of view.",['GOOGL']

* Great studios are very far and few. To develop something like the Witcher series and gain such widespread critical acclaim is not easy. It takes a lot of money, talent, and momentum to be able to build such competence as a developer, that's valuable.
* Essentially CD Projekt Red benefits from being HQ'd in Eastern Europe. These games require an army to develop. Well, eastern developers are a cheap and talented army.
* The games of today are services, they are not one-off products. Cyber Punk will be improved upon, and over time the developers will hash out all the bugs and the game will improve.
* The best time to release a new IP is during the release of a new generation of consoles. It matters less whether the game is any good, the key is to make the IP a thing (one game is not the IP). As far as I am concerned, every gamer has heard of this IP now. All it takes are some critical reviews of the next installments to completely change the media storyline.
* CD Projekt Red made all of Cyber Punk's development costs back before the game was even released in preorders. They are far from losing money at this point.",['IP']

n133p8,,investing,post,1619698785,"DD: Mother's Day is May 9th - Go Get Her Some Nice $FLWS1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March & September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA & ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

If I invest it in an IRA can I take it out at any time or will I get taxed if I take it out before 59.5? My father passed away at 60 so I'd rather spend my money earlier in life. 

Thanks",

mzn9py,,investing,post,1619526251,"What do you think broad market returns will average over the next 20 years?When retirement planning or just choosing between different investment opportunities we all have to make some assumptions about what the long-term broad market outlook is. With a difference of 2% growth rates over the next 20 years there can be massive differences in the end value of your investment.


The historical CAGR (with dividends) of the S&P500 over the last X years (ending Dec 31 2020) is as follows:

100 Years: 10.46%

90: 9.92%

80: 11.23%

70: 11.54%

60: 10.27%

50: 10.76%

40: 12.01%

30: 10.24%

20: 6.59%

10: 13.99%

Source: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm


Knowing this, what do you assume the broad market will have for an annualized growth rate over the next 20 years or so? I'm thinking along the lines of the total S&P500 return, VTSAX, or similar. Why?


I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more. Second, I think macroeconomic headwinds are coming compared to the previous decades that will result in slower overall growth.",['SPGI']
mzn9py,gw2hafy,investing,comment,1619541843,"For what it's worth, despite many on Reddit saying it would be a wild guess, the idea of forecasting returns within a rough degree of accuracy is pretty well accepted in mainstream finance.  After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

There's a bunch more, obviously, but those are some highlights.  I would encourage anyone who genuinely wants to absorb some information to read the [full report](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/ltcma-full-report.pdf).  It's a bit long, but it's full of fantastic insights.

E: it should be noted that JPM isn't the only institution doing this - most banks release similar reports, even the fan favorite Vanguard has long term market assumptions that largely reflect these, and so did Jack Bogle before his passing.  The reason I mention it is to note that the idea of return forecasting isn't some sort of crazy complex finance marketing - it's just an execution of some basic macroeconomics and math.",['JPM']

mzx6w6,,investing,post,1619553654,"Trying to get future valuation based on future estimated Revenues for fuboTV...comments appreciated 

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -> Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -> Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-> Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-> Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook & Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

Is this realistic to attempt a valuation going backwards on Price/Sale ratio?

mzx6w6,gw63iyq,investing,comment,1619616175,"FYI Sales ≠ Revenue.  And why aren't you using Discounted Cash Flow?  Nobody uses sales or revenue to determine price because of all the accounting sleight of hand that affects these figures.  This is why operating cash flow is central to securities pricing.

Operating income has been negative for five straight years.  Operating cash flow has been negative for four of the last five years.

Via free cash flow, you get a fair value of roughly -$40 per share.

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this? 

I don't wanna seem conspiratorial but it'd seem that most institutional investors have a vested interest in holding GE.

mz77xi,,investing,post,1619469066,"New guidelines for DD posts**This is a follow up to /u/Greytoc's post here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mw4jei/psa_stock_promotion_and_suspicious_stock/

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.     

Unrelated: We've eased up the automod constraints on advice/beginner posts to hopefully encourage more complex questions to come through.",

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR']

One ARK exchange-traded fund run by ETF star Cathie Wood bought over 1.5 million shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. ([**NYSE: PLTR**](https://247wallst.com/companies/pltr/)) shares on Tuesday, as the prices of this ETF traded down over 3% in Tuesday’s session. The ETF is up well over 100% in the last year.

ARK Innovation ETF ([**NYSEARCA: ARKK**](https://247wallst.com/companies/arkk/)) bought 1,514,080 shares of Palantir. At Tuesday’s closing price this would have valued this purchase at roughly $32.8 million. This is only a small fraction of the total holdings. ARKK is up 112% over the past 52 weeks.

(NASDAQ: PLTR) builds and deploys software platforms for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations.  
The company offers Palantir Gotham, a software platform for government operatives in the defense and intelligence sectors, which enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals to intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, as well as facilitates the handoff between analysts and operational users, helping operators plan and execute real-world responses to threats that have been identified within the platform.  
The company also provides Palantir Foundry, a platform that transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data, and it allows individual users to integrate and analyze the data they need in one place.

I usually purchase consistently every month but I made the mistake of skipping a few months as I thought it were overvalued. Now markets are still at all time highs and I don't feel comfortable investing my 'serious cash' into such an overvalued market.

The issue I'm seeing is when the market has a very, VERY slight correction, people flock to buy up as entry has been unbelievably limited in my experience - hence pushing prices further.

So my general question is:
How long do you think this booming market will last?

My cash is stacking up and I really don't feel comfortable purchasing at these prices, as a result I've been allocating more cash into my 'play money' system, but I just don't like doing that as much.

Until the major correction comes in, what do you recommend I do? More or less looking for ideas.

The other possible is it is just not seen as a decent long term investment because its relying on fees for income, if some of the feeless coins gain traction, or a major competutor steps up, they have nothing. I think of it as Crypto is the product, Coinbase is the shop and their can be lots of shops vying for those products.",

So I am a teenager and have been into the stock market for quite a while now. I have lately made quite a lot of money from cripto, and since I understand they are very risky and volatile, I was wondering if i should invest the money that I made into an index fund. 
I know index funds are a very safe investment long term, and that’s what i’m looking for, however, I am worried that due to the amount of money that the federal reserve printed to combat the covid economic crisis, the S&P 500 will crash soon because of inflation.

Stocks reversed from yesterday’s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, “I do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it’s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it’s consumer confidence, whether it’s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a “mistake”. He said, “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about it’s plans to expand to the European markets.
* Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year. Virgin Galactic plans to reopen ticket sales after the founder makes his own first flight, now slated for the summer after several delays.
* The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
* Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates. 
* \***\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Apple (AAPL) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target of $171 at Buy. Stock currently around $128
* Align Technology (ALGN) with four target raises. Stock currently around $582

n5xq6v,,StockMarket,post,1620270278,"Does anyone notice a different outcome when trading options on different trading platforms? Also, which platform is your favorite for options trading?From my perspective, there are some HUGE investment brokerage houses (like Fidelity) that charges a nominal amount to execute a trade, and there are others that don't charge a fee to execute a trade (such as RobinHood). I'm thinking that the big brokerage houses that charge a fee have a different operation model, and it **seems to me**, but I haven't scientifically proved this, that they may get better pricing or better execution or both.

$DAO  - Very similar to $COHU bit a macro scale play. If we break this resistance trend line, it may be a massive hit.

&#x200B;

$EARS - Very large potential and volatility, so do extra DD. I like it but in this market it could be a bit sketchy - BUT very profitable.

&#x200B;

$HIMX - Amazing horizontal triangle. IF we get a breakout to the upside, this thing could be an incredible hold and play for weeks. 

&#x200B;

$NARI - Ascending triangle looking beautiful here. Convergence with the support and trend here - it is an amazing play right here.

&#x200B;

$RPAY - Amazing horizontal play here too. Very close to $DAO as well, just use a stop loss as well.

&#x200B;

$WCLD - Amazing ETF that is at value, do extra DD - but when these do get cheap they could be an amazing longer term hold / quick scalp.

Looking for some general guidance and views on what someone else would do.. 

Currently have £60k saved up and am looking to purchase a house later this year. Funds are currently invested across the Vanguard accounts with a split of roughly 30/30/30% of  80% equity, 60% equity and 40% equity. 

I feel like I have de risked the portfolio somewhat by limiting exposure to stock market, but am interested to hear what others would do in this situation. I.e completely remove exposure given time proximity to buy.

I'm looking for anyone to give me feedback on something I've created. I made some programming on my own in order to find some good stocks in that vast amount of available stocks. So I have now several Excel-files with stock data of Dow30, S&P500, Russell1000-3000 and Wilshire5000, which look like the picture I attached here.

There is plenty of information about stocks available in the internet and most of the pages are either “look for a specific stock and get all info for free” or “pay a subscription and unlock all available data”. There is no easy way to get a big Excel-file with all sort of stock data for a little price without subscription.

I am now thinking to make a little website and share this Excel-files to everyone for an affordable price (some dollar?), as it was quite some work to made these files with actual analyst consensus data.

I wonder if anyone would be willing to spend some dollars for downloading such a file?

So I’m kindly asking for your feedback:

\- What do you think of that idea?

\- Would you spend any dollar for such an Excel-file or is this idea just rubbish?

I’m sorry, I do not want to act against the rule “no self promotion”, but I just don’t know who to ask for feedback in that case, so I reached out to you by this post 😊

Fundamental Research initiated coverage on Inner Spirit Here some highlights for the latest equity report. The acquisition price reflects a 290% increase since FRC initiated coverage in November 2019.

* 2020 System-Wide Retail Sales (“SRS”) were up 258% YoY (vs 121% growth in nationwide cannabis retail sales) to $105M. SRS accounts for sales through franchised and corporate-owned stores.
* 2020 revenue was up 230% YoY to $26.8M. Net losses declined from $11.5M (EPS: -$0.05) to $3.1M (EPS: -$0.01). Revenue fell short of our estimate by 1%, and margins were relatively in line. In Q4, the company reported $1.1M (EPS:$0.01) in net income – the first-ever profitable quarter.
* Canadian retail store count in March 2021 was 1,707, up 102% YoY. ISH continues to maintain a 5% market share, with 82 stores at the moment, up from 65 since our Q3 update. The company expects to have 100 stores (including 25 corporate stores) by the end of 2021. We have raised our estimate of corporate stores from 18 to 20 by 2021 year-end.
* The company has already added 14 stores in 2021, including five corporate stores. ISH has 25 stores in Ontario and is planning to enter Manitoba with multiple store openings planned this year.
* Announced a $10M bought-deal financing. These funds will be used for new corporate store openings. The company had $9.5M in convertible debt at the end of 2020; we expect this to be converted into shares (exercise price $0.25).
* We maintain that there is room for about 2,000 additional stores in the country, with over 45% of those new stores anticipated to be in Ontario. Ontario is ISH’s key market for expansion.
* With legal sales rising as a percentage of total sales, and consumers’ strong preference for making purchases at physical stores, we believe ISH is well-positioned for near-term revenue growth.

first he pumped the games_0p trash. i saw that trash got pumped from $46 all the way to $100, in a couple days, then lost momentum and began to fade all the way back.  at that point, it was clear it was only a random, low-float low-market-cap trash stock pump that had been seen in stock market all the time, nothing ""special"", YET. 

then Elon Musk happened. that con artist pumped that trash on his twitter, and with it, the trash gained unprecedented momentum, never seen before in stock market history, with it quickly rising to $500. and it would have kept rising had the brokers not hit the emergency button and stopped it. it would have literally ruined the entire stock market causing systematic collapse if the brokers didnt do it. it would be a repeat of the 2008 crisis where the fall of Lehmans and AIG caused the entire economy to crash.

and now, that snake oil salesman pump trash coins. i must emphasis, TRASH COINS TAKE AWAY INVESTMENTS IN STOCKS. all those idiots with their stimulus checks are not going into stocks any more, coz those idiots believe in conspiracy theories and rather believe in trash coins.

This selloff generally occurs for about 1-2 weeks and then reverses hard to the upside. 

One thing to note by the green boxes showing the move up after the initial selloff is that the price always moves up past the initial earnings price. This most recent earnings move down has a ""gap"" in price which would be the initial target above around $290 if this reverses to the upside.

**TL;DR** \- Is the Tobacco industry a worthy investment considering their impressive free cash flow yields and usage growth in the non-Western world, despite the headwinds they face concerning regulation?

**Hello Investors!**

I originally posted this link to the ValueInvesting and UKInvesting subreddits which resulted in a good discourse around BATS and investing in the tobacco industry in general, so I'd be interested to hear your guys thoughts on the topic:

Link to qualitative and quantitative analysis on BATS above.

The stock is currently trading at levels similar to the lows of the Covid-19 crash and in the video I discuss whether I think it could be a value play, or a value trap, and also provide my intrinsic value calculation using a combination of the discounted cash flow model and future earnings multiples.

I'd appreciate it if you spared some time to take a look at the video and let me know what you think, but a couple of the points I cover are:

**Risks:**

\- The Biden administration are considering the banning of menthol cigarettes, which account for 55% of BAT's cigarette volume in the US. Furthermore, a research study estimates that banning menthol cigarettes will result in 923,000 US smokers to quit, significantly damaging BAT's top and bottom line.

\- There are proposals for increased regulatory action on tobacco producers to significantly reduce the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, reducing their addictiveness and again harming sales and profits.

\- A general trend of increased health consciousness and move away from traditional tobacco products, though the trend of cigarette smokers worldwide still appears to be increasing.

**Opportunities:**

Key opportunity being a move into the cannabis sector following BAT's acquisition of a 20% stake in Organigram.

New category products such as non-combustible/vaping products.

**Quantitative analysis:**

My discounted cash flow shows a potential significant upside in the stock, but using a future earnings multiple approach actually shows a significant downside, with the true intrinsic value likely falling somewhere between the two.

Whether you guys watch the video or not, I'd be interested to hear what your thoughts are on BAT.

Thanks!",

n5lyke,,StockMarket,post,1620236910,"Oh, snap. Crocs stocks are trading at an all-time high Goodbye high heels. Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) are the new it shoe of the pandemic.

There have been many weird changes to our lives over the last year—no longer is it considered lazy to have everything delivered to your door, travelling one suburb away now feels like a vacation, and weed has been deemed essential.

But let’s not forget about the shoes. Comfort has come first, with sneakers the new staple and high heels a relic of the past. And it’s not just Air Jordans that have been on everyone’s feet the past year, apparently. 

The rubber clog that people either love or hate has also been a pandemic favourite. Yep, we’re talking about Crocs. The polarizing footwear, which gained a cult following for its comfort and also a reputation for being aesthetically unpleasing—has been soaring on the stock market. 

The company’s shares skyrocketed 16% on Tuesday after revealing its record-breaking earnings for 2021’s first quarter and its outlook for the rest of the year. The report showed revenue for Crocs increased 64% to $460 million—the third quarter it smashed records. It also reported a net income of $98.4 million, an increase from $11.1 million the year prior. 

On the earnings call, Crocs CEO Andrew Rees said he was “incredibly optimistic” about the rest of 2021 for the company and announced that it has “substantially” raised its guidance for the year.

Why Crocs, why now?

Crocs have always been a popular choice amongst healthcare workers, because of their comfort, so there’s the possibility that the rise in hours workers spent on their feet the past year could have contributed to a rise in sales.

One of the main reasons that Crocs sales are likely to have surged in the past year, though, is the shift to WFH—as anyone too embarrassed to wear their Crocs outside of the house no longer needed to.

The shoes have been making an appearance on more than living room carpets recently, though. Questlove recently stepping out onto the 2021 Oscars red carpet in a gold pair.

Justin Beiber himself has also jumped on the Crocs bandwagon, designing a new pair that comes with socks, (which Victoria Beckham said she would rather die than wear).

But even though Beckham isn’t keen on Beiber’s latest design, a lot of other people clearly were, with the shoe selling out in just 90 minutes.

So what’s next for Crocs? Will Crocs stocks continue to surge? Will investors be as polarized with investing in stocks of the company as they are about wearing the shoes? Time will only tell.

EMA's as we've said are still suggesting a downtrend to be present. But as long as the price stays confidently above $5.80, we can be expecting finally a change of the trend. Because trend is way more likely to continue than to change, that's why we are seeing another bit longer downtrend.

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and  economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near-term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already-elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Operations
With the first string of casing set and cemented in the 6-1 well, the Company owned and operated 1000 HP rig (Jarvie-1) is drilling ahead to a target depth of 3,800 meters (12,500 feet). The 6-1 well is designed to evaluate the petroleum systems discovered in the first well (6-2) in an area of maximum thickness. These first two wells are within one of five major sub-basins of the larger, more laterally extensive, Permian aged deep Kavango basin.
The Company will take whole core, side-wall core and conduct a full logging suite of all zones of interest (conventional targets and source rocks). As with the 6-2, a comprehensive state of the art logging program over both sections will be provided by Schlumberger. In addition, a Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) will be run to enable the most accurate tie-in possible, of well data, to the 2D seismic program scheduled to commence in June, 2021.

Stabilized rice bran has a longer shelf life than un-stabilized rice bran, because it undergoes processing that inactivates an enzyme that would otherwise degrade the rice bran oil, turning it rancid. Stabilization does not affect the nutritional value of the rice bran. Consuming stabilized rice bran offers a number of health benefits, because it serves as an excellent source of essential nutrients.

My Watchlist For 5/5/2021 - Anti Hype, Low Risk High Reward Plays 

&#x200B;

$AES  - amazing ascending triangle that is forming. If we can keep higher lows and the same peaks - we will eventually lead to a massive breakout.

&#x200B;

$COMM - Great up trend, and we need a lower price to buy in, but when it does retract some - it will be a great buy in.

&#x200B;

$KNDI - Amazing horizontal play; IT CAN GET LOWER. So only having a support is not much but it is a very strong one at least.

&#x200B;

$LSPD - Amazing triangle is forming, if tomorrow is a bounce back day - we may see a great start to a great push up.

&#x200B;

$MXIM - Another possible ascending triangle. If we do get a good push it could easily be 5% move fairly quick, I like it.

&#x200B;

$NFE  - We want a pullback. We want to get in around $40 in my opinion. If we get a full move to resistance trendline we can easily see 25%.

&#x200B;

$NXPI - Broadening wedge so the pattern may reset soon, BUT this is an amazing trendline. Right near support as well, love it.

&#x200B;

$TXN  - I spent $150 on this stupid company's calculator... now that we got a great value, let's print and get our money back.","['AES', 'TXN', 'MXIM']"

This is my only mining stock and I am quite bullish on it, here's why.Solaris Inc., a COPPER and GOLD mining company (can't go wrong with these assets!) in the Americas, engages in acquiring, exploring, and evaluating mineral properties. Holds 100%  interest in the Warintza copper project located in the South-Eastern Ecuador; and 75% & 80% interest in the ongoing exploration of copper porphyry in Tamarugo and Ricardo(Chilean copper belt) respectively. The company is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.

According to the company’s official press release early this year ([link](https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-announces-new-discovery-at-warintza-west-geophysics-reveal-more-extensive-porphyry-system-doubling-drill-program-to-12-rigs)): ""Solaris is pleased to announce a significant new discovery in maiden drilling at Warintza West and the first detailed geophysical survey covering its Warintza Project (“Warintza” or “the Project”) have revealed a much more extensive porphyry system than previously understood.  To meet the increased scope of resource and discovery drilling, the Company is doubling its drill program from six to 12 rigs.”  
 A report from the [geophysical](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) investigation shows that  the copper in the ground is worth four or five billion and the market cap is only 1 billion.  
Moreover, Solaris acquisition has significantly been de-risked by being fully funded and availability of drilling resources, so there is no need to worry about capital of the project.  
   
You may also be concerned about the bottom line of the Warintza project after Ecuador’s new president elect; Guillermo Lasso’s government has [full support](https://www.northernminer.com/politics/miners-await-looming-presidential-elections-in-ecuador/1003828891/) of mining projects in the country as will greatly boost the country’s economy and not rely on oil alone.

I'm about to flip everything back on with slightly more lax settings and get the sub back in order.

I know it's easy to believe stories about us and buy into memes about how we're shills or whatever, but we turned that deluge of shitposts into a decent feed every day since 2016 because we enjoy contributing. Do me a favor and challenge the next person alleging something about us to provide proof. Ask them who would benefit the most from convincing a bunch of people that /r/wallstreetbets is compromised.

If you trust me, then believe me when I say things are good. There are no shenanigans. Things have changed around us and while we can always adapt, we can't compromise and appease people when we think they're asking us to do the wrong thing. I'd rather see other stock subs carry the torch than allow rule-breaking content solely to not upset someone. I'd like to think of WSB like a sports league subreddit (NFL, NHL) and the single-stock subs as teams. There's no reason for us to fight. They can plumb the depths of their sole interest, we can be generalists. We've always had high standards while simultaneously being kinda retarded and I don't want to lose that.

I hope that all the good work we did and still do isn't forgotten for low-information insults and conspiracy theories. Don't buy all the BS, nothing has changed on our end. Same mods (without the old shill mods), same rules, same effort.

Hell, if people are still convinced that we're somehow exerting control in nefarious ways I'd go so far as to livestream mod logs/spam submission queue.",

n650iw,gx57ses,wallstreetbets,comment,1620305594,"New Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Gary Gensler will testify before the House Financial Services Committee  on Thursday. This is the third House hearing focused on [GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GME), but this is Gensler’s first appearance as chairman before the Committee.

Gensler’s  prepared testimony indicates he will address a broad range of topics  around Gamestop and protection of investors, including:

## ‘Gamification’ of trading.

Gensler  will begin his testimony on the increasing gamification of trading,  which he defined as trading that has “game-like features” — such as  points, rewards, leaderboards, bonuses, and competitions — to increase  engagement.

“Many of these features encourage investors to trade  more,” Gensler said. “Some academic studies suggest more active trading  or even day trading results in lower returns for the average trader.”

Gensler  said he has asked his staff to prepare a request for public input: “We  need to ensure investors using apps with these types of features  continue to be appropriately protected.”

## Payment for order flow

Many  brokers now send their orders to market makers in exchange for  payments, a process known as “payment for order flow.”  The market  makers can either execute the orders directly or pass it on to an  exchange or other trading venues.

Because higher levels of trading  generate more payment to brokers, Gensler asked: “Do broker-dealers  have inherent conflicts of interest? If so, are customers getting best  execution in the context of that conflict? Are broker-dealers  incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently than is in  those customers’ best interest?”

Gensler  did not directly address these questions, but implied the recent  enforcement action against Robinhood was a warning sign. “Robinhood  explicitly offered to accept less price improvement for its customers in  exchange for receiving higher payment for order flow for itself. As a  result, many Robinhood customers shouldered the costs of inferior  executions; these costs might have exceeded any savings they might have  thought they’d gotten from a zero commission.”

## Equity market structure

That  payment for order flow has turned into a lucrative business. Gensler  says about 38% of equity trading volume is executed by those  off-exchange wholesalers. Citadel Securities, Gensler noted, has  publicly stated that it executes about 47% of all retail volume.

Gensler  asked if this concentration was consistent with the SEC’s mandate to  promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.  “History and economics  tell us that when markets are concentrated, those firms with the  greatest market share tend to have the ability to profit from that  concentration,” he said, “I’ve asked staff to look closely at these  issues to determine which policy approaches may be merited.”

Citadel  Securities declined to comment. However, in testimony in February of  this year in the House of Representatives, Citadel founder Ken Griffin  said: “With respect to payment for order flow, we simply play by the  rules of the road. Payment for order flow has been expressly approved by  the SEC. It is a customary practice within the industry. If they choose  to change the rules of the road, we need to drive on the left side  versus the right side, that’s fine with us.”

## Short positions: Should they be disclosed?

Hedge  funds and other investors who hold significant stock positions are  required to report long positions on a quarterly basis, but those who  hold short positions are not. 

That has led to calls that short  sellers should also be required to disclose their positions:  “Enhancing  disclosures could improve market efficiency and end some wild  speculation (and misinformation) about short selling and short  positions,” Tyler Gellasch, executive eirector of Healthy Markets, said  in an open letter to Gensler.

Gensler told the committee he has  directed SEC staff to prepare recommendations for the SEC’s  consideration on short selling disclosure.

## The Archegos mess

Though  unrelated to GameStop, Gensler also brought up the failure of Archegos  Capital Management and the losses incurred by several banks that  provided prime brokerage services to them. The “core” of the problem,  Gensler said, was Archegos’ use of total return swaps based on  underlying stocks, and the significant exposure that the prime brokers  had to the family office.

Gensler said he has asked his staff for  recommendations on whether to include total return swaps and other  security-based swaps under new disclosure requirements. 

## Social media hype

Gensler  also raised concerns that wrongdoers will attempt to use social media  to hype stocks or manipulate markets.  He offered no specific  suggestions, but said that “This is an area for which we will continue  to deepen our understanding, resources, and capabilities.”

## Margin requirements

Gensler  noted that “at least one firm didn’t have sufficient liquidity to meet  margin calls and had to fundraise within hours to meet $1 billion-plus  obligations, and several brokers chose to shut down customer access to  trading.”  Gensler said this raised questions about whether margin  requirements are sufficient, and whether broker-dealers have appropriate  tools to manage their liquidity and risk. “I’ve asked staff to look at  these issues carefully,” he said.

## Shorter settlement period

Stocks  currently take two days after a trade is made to settle, a convention  known as “T + 2.”  Gensler noted that “the longer it takes for a trade  to settle, the more risk our markets assume” and that the technology  exists to eventually shorten the settlement cycle to T + 1 or even  same-day settlement.  “I’ve directed the SEC staff to put together a  draft proposal for the Commission’s review on this topic,” he said.

## Where is the SEC going?

While  Gensler’s comments lacked specifics, analysts noted that his comments  clearly indicated the direction he was taking the SEC on these issues.

“This  is the first time he has come out, and he is pretty negative on payment  for order flow and the concentration of market makers,” Rich Repetto  from Piper Sandler told me, noting his remarks were “troublesome for  e-brokers and market makers.”

Repetto also said not to mistake the  lack of specifics for lack of direction:  “When he says he is  ‘directing’ his staff he is implying there is going to be some kind of  action,” noting that the committee will now expect some kind of update  on what the SEC is doing in the coming months.

Indeed, Gensler told the committee his staff would be publishing a report on market events over the summer.

Gensler  also left the door open to enforcement actions against those violating  SEC rules:  “While I cannot comment on ongoing examination and  enforcement matters, SEC staff is vigorously reviewing these events for  any violations. I also have directed staff to consider whether expanded  enforcement mechanisms are necessary.”",

Anyone who knows anything about data science knows what Palantir offers for businesses as well as government agencies. Just this morning, they made another deal with the US Coast Guard. Go figure, \[shorts\] time to chop the stock down 6% because I feel like it... As someone who is planning on paying their college debt with this stock 4 years from now, I'd like to say one thing to the shorts.

n6b5f9,,wallstreetbets,post,1620318178,"$ASTS a global mobile broadband solutionFirst of all, I am young and full of cum, I started gambling in 2020 before the pandemic and have been looking for high potential long-term plays (peaked at $1 million, after starting with 1k). u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT is a big inspiration (show us the loss porn dude).

Today, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.

*Why should you care?*

The recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).

The company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.

*Alright… 100x if everything goes well, right?*

Yes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).

**Desirability**

*Targeted Segment*

Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST’s satellites like 5G towers in space.
Of the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.

To put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.

*Customer Relationships & Channels*

All the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.

*Value Proposition*

Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.
Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.

**Feasibility**

*Key Partners*

In the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.
They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).

Regarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.

*Key Activities*

AST will design and integrate the satellites. The company’s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.

Of course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.

Future agreements won’t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.

*Key Resources*

Talent, technology, and funding.

Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.

As mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST’s technology and has concluded that it works.

For further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company’s plan for global coverage.

**Viability**

*Revenue Streams*

Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.

*Cost Structure*

Because the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.

Now let's talk about an important topic: Risk.

**Risk**

*Tech(nichal/nology) risks*

* Launch delays for BW3 (final full-size prototype) might increase costs. especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle. This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021.

* Technology does not work. While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1, there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing.

* The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries. Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone.

*Commercial risks*

* End-users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers. Difficult to see why that would be the case.

* Telecom companies do not see value in AST's offering. AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise.

From a risk perspective, technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside. The company could literally go to 0 (or close to it if they can sell some of their techs/patents/etc.). However, I believe the company offers a unique risk/reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market.

**The long-term play**

Shares, shares, shares.

**The short-term play**

The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.
Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers’ agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.

TL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years

I’ve been deep here since it was a spac as NPA. 

The float here is tiny and volatile. It’s been hedged/shorted against pipe(institutional investors) since their shares are locked up for over a year(usually a great thing), but they needed to lock in profit somehow. The price has been artificially kept low on low volume. Huge amount of the float is locked up with 💎🙏 And same with the warrants. If you can handle big ups and down and the potential for a $250-$1000 stock in the next 3-7 years, LETS GO! 

I have 3500 shares and 4100 warrants and am adding more as I get a chance. 

Many catalysts this year from analyst coverage, PT’s from that coverage, BW3 launching this year(look it up), 5G rural fund($9 billion fund ASTS has potential to get a big chunk of that), and much more.

RKT primarily lends for refinancings. When rates go up as most investors expect, this business will suffer. RKT's management team repeatedly argued during their earnings call that they were trying to become a leading lender for home purchases, but they're not yet. UWMC is - very little of UWMC's business is refinance related, and there's enough unmet demand that rising interest rates are unlikely to halt the frantic homebuying market any time this year. 

UWMC also moved aggressively in the past quarter to shut RKT out of lenders it does business with. What portion of RKT's decreased earnings went to UWMC as a result?

n6azqb,,wallstreetbets,post,1620317763,"How to cope with RKT losses.Many of you myself included woke up this morning with worthless calls, or a lot of RKT shares down almost 18 percent. 

Rather than posting loss porn or crying about it, here are some things you can do to turn the ship around

1. Diversify - there are several good plays always available. Realize that betting the farm on one good play has the very real chance of turning against you. Myself personally, I hate diversification. I would rather just put all my money into a few companies I trust, sit back, and watch what happens. The current market environment right now however is punishing us for portfolio concentration. You don't have to invest in the SPY to be fully diversified, but it would certainly help to have maybe a pool of 8-12 stocks you really like, and try to at least have a little bit of sector diversification so that when all of tech is down you still have something up.  IE.. I love CRSR, ASO, RKT, and TSLA. If you like all these companies about equally, don't feel like a loser for divvying up your money between them. There is no rule that you have to pick one and live or die by their earnings. 
2. If you hold RKT shares, don't sell. It's still a good company. They had one slightly lower than expected quarter (literally missed by 1 penny on the EPS). It's not the end of the world. Most analysts agree that the stock is still undervalued. Right now people are panic selling and trying to make the shareholders feel miserable. If you bought at 23 then you should hold at 18 and tough it out. **AT THE VERY LEAST - if you no longer want to be a long term shareholder, seriously consider chilling out for a bit and waiting for the stock to revert to the mean**. RKT has solid fundamentals. This isn't MVIS, WKHS, SPCE.
3. Sell covered calls - I would wait 1-2 weeks for the RKT hate to die down. When sentiment is back to ""neutralish"" and the stock has recovered a little bit from the major blow, start selling covered calls to work your way back to cost basis. You might have to keep doing this for a few months but eventually I see RKT going back up to 22-23 range quite easily. RKT is and always has been a great stock to wheel, the earnings report hasn't changed that.

\- LAST, don't lose hope. If you lost all your money on RKT calls, it's okay. I started out in the stock market very little capital. It took me about a year to reach portfolio value of around 40k. I'm down a bit from there, but I'm in this for the long haul. This is your chance to restart using everything you've learned about the stock market to make better decisions. Also.. think about it this way. You paid for those calls or those shares for the OPPORTUNITY but not the GUARANTEE that the shares would go up. Those calls weren’t worthless, you made a calculated bet with the hope/expectation of gain. You can’t be too hard on yourself for at least trying to win.",['TSLA']

n6bvcw,,wallstreetbets,post,1620320072,"VIAC massively undervalued right now and has had an amazing earnings reportVIAC (ViacomCBS) is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping.","['NFLX', 'VIAC']"

It's a good opportunity for retail investors to get better informed and get empowered.

Better Markets is an independent non-profit whose focus is the promotion of public interest in the financial markets. They're like the watchdogs of Wall Street post-2008. They're proposing the following recommendations to the SEC:  (I'm merely copy-pasting the meat of their most recent report)

&#x200B;

# Public Transparency

>The SEC must dramatically improve short-interest reporting.  All short interests must be publicly reported in a (1) timely, (2) comprehensive, and (3) standalone manner designed to maximize the informational value that rationalizes short selling (and other short interests) in the securities markets.  
>  
>**Recommendations:**  
>  
>***1) Form  13F:***   The  SEC  must  implement  a  long  overdue Form  13F filing  requirement  for institutional investment managers that (1) includes a standalone short-interest schedule as a supplement to existing long-position reporting, (2) contemplates public reporting of all threshold short interests, including those involving securities lending/borrowing, options, and equity derivatives positions, and (3) is published on at least a monthly (as opposed to quarterly) basis, with an appropriately minimal delay calibrated solely to protect trading strategies.  
>  
>***2) Securities  Lending  Reporting:***   The  SEC must implement  section  984(b)  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which instructed the commission to “increase the transparency  of  information  available  to  brokers,  dealers, and  investors,  with  respect  to  the  loan  or borrowing of securities” and which was supposed to be completed “\[n\]ot later than 2 years after the date of \[the Dodd-Frank Act’s\] enactment” in July 2010.1This flagrant disregard of a Congressional directive must  be  remedied  with a securities-lending regulatory  and  public reporting framework (see also comments relating to the consolidated audit trail below).  
>  
>***3) FINRA  Broker-Dealer  Reporting:***   The  SEC  must  require the Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority (“FINRA”) to implement daily aggregate short interest reporting for broker-dealers, as it has implemented for the equity  trade  reporting  facilities (see footnote  2 below).    Presently, FINRA Rule  4560 requires broker-dealers  to  report  total  short  positions  in  all  customer  and  proprietary  accounts in  all  equity securities  only twice  per  month. As above,  we  encourage  the  SEC  and  FINRA  to  require  broker-dealer short interest reporting with an appropriately minimal delay.  
>  
>***4) FINRA  Equity  Trade  Reporting  Facilities  &  Exchange  Reporting:***  The  SEC must  implement  regulations requiring FINRA to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC.  The SEC must similarly implement regulations requiring the securities exchanges to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC. The SEC must also consider consolidating information in a descriptive monthly short-sale report and making some portion of the data available through its data visualization tools.

# Regulatory Safeguards:

>The  SEC  must  ensure that short  selling  is  subject  to a reasonable,  unambiguous regulatory  framework that restricts  and  deters short-selling  practices that interfere  with  fair,  orderly,  and efficient markets.  
>  
>**Recommendations:**  
>  
>***5) Eliminate Market-Maker Exception to the Locate Requirement:***  The SEC must institute a broad prohibition on naked short selling (see Appendix A below) and abandon the market-making exception to the Locate Requirement in Regulation SHO.3 That loophole permits the largest proprietary trading firms to engage in naked short selling on the theory that it facilitates trading in hard-to-borrow securities. However, the SEC’s settlement regulations with respect to mandatory buy-ins already provide special accommodations to market-makers that cannot close out their short positions within the failure-to-delivery (“FTD”) close-out timeframe.  
>  
>***6) Short Position Accountability and Limits:***  The SEC must implement a net short position accountability and position limits framework, along with a special filing requirement for market participants that have net short positions at least in hard-to-borrow equities deemed excessive (i.e., exceeding an SEC-determined threshold) relative to the total tradeable float in a security.  Stocks experiencing aggregate short interest in excess of 90 percent of the tradeable float in the security, for example, should trigger imposition of this position limits framework.  
>  
>***7) Uptick Rule:***  The SEC should reinstitute the Uptick Rule, which ameliorated price declines associated with short-selling  for  almost  70  years  without  significant  effects  on  the  development  of  the  U.S.  capital markets.  The SEC’s elimination of that rule prior to the 2008 financial crisis was unnecessary and poorly conceived.  Although there is merit to the Alternative Uptick Rule, we are not persuaded that a single-day 10 percent downturn in a company’s share  price  should  be required  to  reinstate uptick restrictions on short selling.

# Operational Integrity:

>The SEC must ensure that operational integrity is maintained throughout the clearing and settlement system.  
>  
>**Recommendations**:  
>  
>***8) Mandatory  Buy-Ins  and Punitive  Fee  Assessments:***   The  SEC  must continue  to require  clearing broker-dealers to immediately close out failures-to-deliver (“FTDs”) during the settlement process,4which should include mandatory (1) buy-in processes on T+2 for short sales (in a T+1 settlement framework); and(2) fee  assessments designed  to  punish  and  deter firms  with  FTDs that are  not  closed  out  timely under Regulation SHO. Fee assessments should climb as the outstanding period for a short-selling-related FTD lengthens.  
>  
>***9) T+1 Settlement:***  The SEC must shorten the settlement cycle to T+1 (i.e., trade-date-plus-one-trading-day), which would reduce operational and other risks in our settlement system, including risks associated with FTDs and naked short selling.The securities markets currently operate on a T+2 time horizon.  Because margin models at the National Securities Clearing Corporation account for risks during the period of time that elapses between the trading and settlement of transactions, a shorter time horizon for settlement—like  T+1—would  not  only  reduce  risks to  the  clearing and  settlement system  but  also  generally  reduce liquidity  demands  and  risks  to  clearing  firms  that  must  meet  margin  calls  calibrated  to  the  risks  and volatilities expected for the firm’s overall portfolio during the unsettled risk period.In addition to these benefits, the shortened T+1 settlement period may diminish the number of unsettled transactions arising from  the  re-lending  process,  which  has  been  characterized  as  creating  temporary  “phantom”  or “duplicate” shares.

# Monitoring  and Enforcement:

>The  SEC  must  ensure that  the Division  of  Enforcement (‘DOE”) has  the information to protect investors and markets and punish and deter unlawful short selling practices, including manipulation and fraud  
>  
>**Recommendation:**  
>  
>***10) Consolidated Audit Trail:***  Short selling information will be part of the CAT, once operationalized.  The SEC therefore must promptly implement the long-overdue and industry-delayed CAT,so that its divisions can analyze timely  and  comprehensive  information  on  short-selling  for  oversight,  enforcement,  and  policy purposes.See our CAT fact sheet.The SEC also must require regulatory and public reporting of certain information  relating  to securities-lending  activities.    Thus,  it  must  explore  requiring  securities-lending reporting as part of the CAT .

# Conclusion

>Recent data analyzed by the SEC suggests that short selling may comprise as much as half of all listed equity share volume.5Despite  this  fact,  the  practice  is  subject  to  a  rudimentary  regulatory  framework.    Our  recommendations  for reasonable  short-selling  transparency requirements,  regulatory  safeguards,  operational  improvements,  and  monitoring and enforcement measures would enhance the current SEC framework, protect fair, orderly, and efficient trading, level the informational and trading playing field for investors, and better serve issuers (companies), investors, and the purposes of the securities markets—i.e., to support capital formation and the integrity of the price discovery process that informs capital allocation.  
>  
>Unless the SEC makes significant progress in each of the four identified areas, certain short selling practices in the U.S. securities markets will continue to undermine investor and issuer confidence, as well as the fundamental purposes of our markets.

n6cfd9,,wallstreetbets,post,1620321557,"Market Behavior DDAlright you fucks. I'm going to give a short but sweet guide to the Markets behavior. For you simpletons I'll sum it up in one easy sentence.

Any good news causes the stock to take a massive shit. 

Yes, you heard it here. Any news that would otherwise cause a stocks value to rise actually makes it take a huge dump. 

Tilray: acquired Aphira, prospects to be the worlds number one weed supplier look great. Stock drops 4 bucks and stays there.

MVIS: currently the only company with a working (and best in industry) Lidar and has prosect to either get massive contracts or even be bought out by Microsoft. Plummets like 15 fuckin bucks and hasn't gone anywhere since. 

GME: Hired top E-Commerce figures and booted their old dusty ass Board. Poised to be an industry leader in online sales and paid off their debt. Shit dropped from like 250-275 to 150-180 and has struggled to get anywhere since. 

But what's that you say? Bad news should make the stock rise then?

Fuck you for even thinking it.

Tonix pharma: rejected trials, failed formulas. Shit was once 4 grand a piece and now it's struggling to hit 1.20.

Apple and others suffering from Chip shortages, fell from 140s to 111. 

So whatever you're invested in, if you are expecting to hear ANY news about it coming up, wether earnings, announcements on product trials or if the CEO was caught at the boarder with drugs, prepare for a kick in the balls.

Exception: Alibaba ... Massive law suit, CEO disappears for weeks, suspected killed by China's Gov for calling them out, shit skyrockets ...

LETS SHOW UP IN FORCE AND SURPRISE THE SHORTS WITH A 30% RUN FROM THE LOW. FCK UP THE HEDGIES. Make MAMA WOOD PROUD. SHE IS FOR RETAIL. 😤🚀🚀🚀😤😤🚀 Fck the funds and people who love when retail loses $. 

ORIGINAL POST: 

Whether you are a short term trader or a long term investor, I believe there is a huge opportunity in $SKLZ. 

💵 🚀 🚀 For Short Term Traders: 

1. Short volume ratio was ~54% as of today and short volume was ~33% 

2. Cathie Wood has bought &gt;6 million shares in the last 48 hours, which invites hedge funds to short heavily

3. ER was a fantastic catalyst yesterday, with a beat on revenue, a raise on full year guidance, the addition of executives from Airbnb and Beats, 95% gross profit margins, and 83% YOY paying user growth - shorts still won the fight even though it started green today, ending another ~10% down

4. SKLZ is down ~70% from its high in February 

This is the perfect short squeeze candidate in my opinion, with the fundamentals to back it as a long term growth play. Retail loves it, Cathie loves it, and funds love to short it. 

✅ 💪🏼For Growth Investors: 

1. SKLZ is the Shopify of mobile gaming. Both are PLATFORM providers for small developers. However, SKLZ provides a platform that allows any game developer to host real time multiplayer cash competitions. Skillz is able to have 95% gross profit margins because they have no game development costs. 

2. Mobile game developers are incentivized to partner with Skillz not only because of their 2.7 million monthly active users and growing... but because users on Skillz games are more than EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY to pay than they would be for an in app purchase. On average, 17% of Skillz games users pay to play. The average deposit is over $10.30. 

3. SKLZ issued upped full year guidance of 375 million, however, they noted they are EXTREMELY frugal with this. The chance of a HUGE beat on this guidance is very high. The following were left out of revenue projections: 
-Expansion to India in Q3 of this year (Indian mobile gaming market is growing twice as fast as the US and is much larger to begin with. US is only 10%)
-Tetris and Big Buck Hunter being added to the platform, as well as several additional games with synchronous tournaments being tested
-Monetization of non-paying players through ads etc beginning Q3
-The sale of the huge trove of customer data Skillz has acquired, beginning in Q3
......... ADDITIONALLY: Next year’s revenue guidance has not been updated but was originally pegged at 560 million, WITHOUT any of the above catalysts. 

4. Skillz plans to expand to several additional countries in 2022, which alone could quadruple revenues by 2023E 

5. Management plans to partner with exercise companies such as peloton and first person shooter games to allow for real-time competition where Skillz takes a 15% cut of all entry fees. Remember, regardless of who wins a match, Skillz will take 15% of the entry fees. Peloton has specifically been mentioned numerous times by the CEO in interviews. Imagine versing someone through their app and the fastest time wins the payout. Battle royal games in the near future are also a market they are expanding into according to the earnings report. 

6. Look at how Shopify grew over a 5 year time horizon. The chart was also ugly to start and people didn’t understand the small developers e-commerce offering just as they don’t understand Skillz. Most funds and analysts still think Skillz makes games, while they only provide a platform. However, in the future they could make some of their own like Netflix does. 

7. Skillz recently partnered with the NFL for a competition to have a game developer make a viral NFL game that will be cross-marketed by the NFL and Skillz. This submission period ends in May and we can see something by the beginning of next year, and marketing later this year as well as a beta version. Expect tons of additional partnerships to roll out, as SKILLZ will likely partner with additional sports organizations and potentially gambling platforms such as DKNG (shared SPAC management team brought them both forward). 

8. 618 million in cash on the balance sheet with ZERO debt and tons of postings on their website looking for strategy analysts with M&amp;A and investment banking experience. I believe they are looking to acquire heavily to grow their pretense internationally in the coming year. 

9. Players on average spend ~62 minutes per day playing Skillz games, which is more than the average time spent on Tiktok, Snapchat, Facebook, and Netflix. This is a metric well regarded and shared by management. 

Listen.... SKLZ is not for the faint of heart, but I strongly and truly believe, in 5 years, THIS can be the next Shopify. I am simply here to let you know why I believe in it. Both short and long term. Fck the tutes who have manipulated the chart, and much love to Cathie and the retail that have diamond hands 💎 🙌🏻","['NFLX', 'FB', 'AMP']"

Thesis/TLDR:  Buy ABNB.

AirBNB (ABNB) is undervalued and will bounce leading up to and beyond it's earnings date on 5/13/21.

Current Price: $153/shareMy Target Price: $185 by end of May

It is my intention to purchase additional calls if the price continues to drop leading up to earnings date.  I may also accumulate additional shares.

&#x200B;

ABNB and IPO'ed in December, hit a low of $122 shortly thereafter before finding a high of $219 on Feb 11th. It has trended downward since.

This is a heavily shorted stock with 22% short interest reported. Detractors believe the stock to be overpriced and will argue that the pandemic will continue to weigh on revenues and that the stock will see outsized competition from hotel groups other travel sites like VRBO. Regional legal challenges also remain a significant factor.

These issues noted, I believe this is a growth stock with it's best days ahead of it and the recent drop in price to be overdone. The whole thing reeks of manipulation to me. This is the ""go to"" vacation rental stock for so many areas and generally has a better reputation and much more momentum than it's competition. Larger trends and the pro/cons of airbnb aside, I believe that the earnings and guidance presented next week will set into motion what will be a relatively quick rise to $185 and beyond in weeks to follow.",['ED']

The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...

&#x200B;

The first ""issue"" was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a **$234,357.55 cash call** on my account. 

&#x200B;

[Cash Call](https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25)

You may be thinking, ""you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen"", but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned **<10 shares** of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300's (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a **short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86**, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. 

&#x200B;

I'm still not sure what happened that day, but E\*TRADE admitted it was an ""error"" on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn't even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?

Well a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a *PMCC* on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn't have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for **19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM** resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for...

**...$21,554.07!** Again, after contacting E\*TRADE and looking up whatever a ""Fed Call"" was, it was deemed to be yet another ""error"" on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. **$8.** No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E\*TRADE.

&#x200B;

Okay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to *\*drumroll please\*,* **over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!** I was the lucky winner of the E\*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I've had to contact support for their ""issues"", I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E\*TRADE employee!

&#x200B;

As I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar 'Fed Call', they may not act rationally - that's a lot of fucking money. And they'd have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn't make mistakes like this...or maybe not.

n69khe,,wallstreetbets,post,1620314031,"Flash Crash of 2010 // ARKK // The Ultimate Hedge TrophyThe topic of Cathy Woods vs. the Hedges has been increasingly talked about over the last few days.  I'll argue that it's not being talked about enough.  

If you think GME is the biggest trophy prize for hedge funds, you are wrong.  It's ARK.  

Today is the anniversary of the Flash Crash of 2010.  It has everything to do with the market manipulation that we're seeing today, especially in small cap tech.  The actual time of the flash was 2:32, about 3 hours from now.  Look it up.  It's retail trading history, and it was a wealth grab in the trillions. 

Today is the turning point for many of Cathy's portfolios, and if ARKK loses support at 105.50, the entire sector is going to plummet.   ARKK will probably knife to 90.  The hedge funds will have one of their most profitable days in history.  

The Hedges want nothing more than for an embarrassed Cathy Woods to go on MSNBC tomorrow, fresh off one of the worst days of her professional life.  Regardless, she'll handle herself with dignity and grace, and in a way that no male CEO would have to do.  She's the face of more than just an ETF, and everyone knows it. 

Figure out if you love her or hate her another day- just go buy some ARK, and hold it.

n67sva,,wallstreetbets,post,1620309240,"$DFEN Direxion Aerospace and Defense DD 

**Positions and Overview:**

Before anything else, my position for you retards.

**2,400 Shares @ 21.32** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1yvxcwfl8ix61.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5368491dd33693544377c57c7c9a5cb4e091857d

$DFEN a.k.a The Direxion Aerospace & Defense Bull 3x Shares ETF (Oh god! An ETF? Yes.) has been slowly rising out of misery since March when the Coronavirus knocked-out the Market harder than Ray Rice hit his girlfriend. Based on some extremely intriguing chart analysis, blue-chip companies being the bulk of holdings, many of the holdings benefitting from a return to normal, and a personal YOLO, I believe this ETF has the potential to create big returns in the future. 

**Let’s Now Look At Some Juicy Analytics**

* $DFEN currently sits @ 21.88, before COVID hit the ETF was trading @ 69.30
* When Covid hit, $DFEN dropped to a staggering low of $6.00
* $DFEN debuted in 2017 @ 24.00 and before COVID hit, it has never fallen below the Initial Price ($24 to $70 in roughly 3 years time)
* The CDC announced today they expect to see “A significant drop in the level” of cases by July. This can only help the Airline Holdings of $DFEN

**A Nut-Busting Phenomenon** 

The chart below is the main reason I am intrigued with $DFEN.

$DFEN TOP 10 HOLDINGS (This is roughly 75% of the ETF)

https://preview.redd.it/hggh08779ix61.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=d88e6e5e70c27ab711bf6565bbae6968f7fe6f06

 

**In Summary/Positives**

* 6 out of the 10 largest holdings have yet to recover from Pre-Pandemic levels. However, all of the companies that have yet to recover are Large Cap, Blue-Chip corporations. In addition, the stocks that have yet to fully recover make up roughly 50% of holdings. 
* Instead of trying to bet on one of these companies recovering faster than all others, $DFEN provides an all in one solution for you retards.
* Aerospace isn’t going anywhere 
* Biden’s defense budget is slightly higher than Trump, meaning Gov’t will continue to buy from certain companies being held in $DFEN

**Potential Downfalls/Reasons I am wrong**

* The current economic fears cause market correction (Inflation, Biden Tax Hike, Bubble fears)
* Covid Cases continue to run and stall recovery (Thank you India for your contributions)
* Largest Holding Companies miss earnings
* I have been wrong many times in my life.

\*Again, I am in @ **21.32 with 2,400 Shares**. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am a simple 19 year old college student who has had mild success in the market (Thanks in large part to WSB #BB #EXPR). If you need a reason to trust me, I have been investing for 3 years and have quadrupled my money. If you need a reason not to trust me, I lost 30% of my portfolio in one day (Thank you Coinbase!).",

The last one I wrote was being removed by automod constantly (too many links maybe?) so i just posted it elsewhere. Regardless, this is my last one, as earnings are finally going to be here on Monday.

So, before I begin, I would like us to give a moment of silence for our Rocket bag holder friends. Requiescat in pace you poor apes. If you need some help for your shell shock, or someone to blame, I direct you to the CEO of UWMC. He may, or may not, have taken Rocket to the back and beat the living \*\*\*\* out of it. Took a shotgun to their kneecaps. Bent Rocket over his knee and given it a spanking.

Let us be clear that this dude just Arminius’d (Of Teutoburg Forest) Rocket. Dan Gilbert probably called up Varus and delivered a “Jay Farnery, GIVE ME BACK MY WHOLESALE CHANNEL.” Or, you know, Thermoplylaed him, except if the Spartans had won right at the pass instead of a few months later.

Okay, memes aside, let us get to the deets.

UWMC Share Structure:

\- Class A Shares of which there is a dividend of 40 cents a share per year. Represents 6% of the Company and is in the public float.

\- Class D shares with 10 votes per each share, but no dividend. However, the Class D shares are capped at 79 Percent Voting Rights. Which means that the Class A shares represent 21% voting rights.

LDI Highlights:

\- Spent 200 Million on a special dividend of .69, and announced they were very likely to give a .08 cent quarterly dividend starting in Q2. They issued senior bond notes at 6.25% to fund this, as well as other things.

\- Stock price was up as much as 7.5 percent before market open, and then tanked.

Starting with UWMC & Increasing their Capacity

\- AMC Changes. Adding 50-100 more AMCs in the next 30-60 Days to increase time to close even further. Also encouraging the best AMCs to choose UWMC, by raising the benefits for Appraisers by increasing their benefits. Watch the Fastbreak video to find out how.

\- Manufactured Home Loans – Not Available at UWM on Conventional and Government Loans (Competitively priced).

\- Prime Jumbo Expansion – Raised Max limit to 3Million, allowed RSU income, and more such as only one appraisal to 1 Million. à These are being serviced directly by UWMC so they have a lot of flexibility on them. (They relaunched it on March 17th, and are already making it a better offering)

\- Lowered their FHA minimum score to 620 on Government Loans, among a few other changes.

\- ARMS are back. 5-, 7-, and 10-year rates. They can save 5/8th of a rate at the 7 year ARM. Sharp pricing. Adds options to brokers. 7 Tear one is good for refinance candidates according to the CEO.

\- Prime Jumbo 30 Year Released. These ones are not going to be serviced by UWMC but will instead be sold on. Their offering better pricing than their portfolio prime jumbo. However, guidelines and matrix are slightly tighter.

o But the portfolio prime jumbo regular program is going to have over 2 billion in May alone.  They are the only ones who have a product where they retain their jumbos.

\- Ultimate Submissions – Using 6-8 of these will. Goanna cut 3.5 off the CTC process, and also shave 1 day off your processor touch.

UWMC Estimated Loan Volume for Q1 and Estimated forward guidance for Q2

\- UWMC had closed Loan volume of 54.7 Billion in Q4 2020, with a gain margin of 3.05%.

o RKT barely met expectations which it had set for closed loan volume, and missed revenue and EPS estimates, which is unacceptable considering that every other mortgage company (Redwood Trust, LDI) that has reported has beat it out of the park. LDI beat EPS by 73.03% and beat Revenue by 30.38% for example. They also announced a special dividend of .69 and announced they are looking to set a dividend of 8 cents a quarter starting in Q2 of 2021.

o RKT gain on sale margin reduced from 2.57% to 1.93% on their partner network for Q1 2021. Please note that this is not the wholesale channel completely as their two primary partnership types are marketing and influencer.

§ This represents a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin from Q4 2020, or 249 Basis Points.

o LDI’s partner channel gain on sale margin decreased from 2.58% to 1.85%. That is a 28.2% or 282 Basis Point Decrease.

o LDI’s Partner Channel is through the whole sale channel, and through Joint Venture’s with Home Builders. However, the actual volume remains unmoved. Rate locks decreased from last quarter. It stood at 9.645 last quarter, but only 8.688 this quarter. While Loan Originations only increased from 7,730,101 to 8,051,362. We can assume this was largely off their Joint Venture with Home Builders.

\- UWMC is expecting Closed Loan Volume of between $52 and $57 Billion for Q1 2021.

o On CNBC their CEO stated they were right in the middle, however the April bump in refinance activity and purchase activity as rates eased down back under 3% likely gave them the boost they needed.

o Reopening the spigot on Jumbo Loans and FHA loans (while ensuring a fantastic Q2) will help raise closed loan volume for Q1 2021 as Jumbo only accounted for 583,299 in 2020 but 3,570,520 for 2019.

§ They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker’s business by expanding their Jumbo Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWMC’s CEO.

o Reopening the spigot on FHA loans will create a lot of closed loan volume as FY 2019 was 13,151,943 but FY 2020 was only 8,619,874.

§ They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker’s business by expanding their FHA Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWM’s CEO.

\- Capacity, and options for wholesale mortgage brokers are opening. The CEO of UWMC has been very big on this, and we can start seeing the fruits of this in Q2 2021. I don’t expect closed loan volume for any of the new offerings from the last week or this week to impact Q1 2021, but I do expect closed loan volume to be impacted very positively for Q2 2021.

\- UWMC is expecting a gain margin of 200-220 BPS or 2%-2.20%.

o However, a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin means a 2.29% Gain on Sale margin. Which means a 9 Basis Point beat. If, like LDI, there is margin expansion due to UWMC’s tech then this could mean even more of a margin gain.

o A 28.2% gain on sale margin decrease leads to a 2.19% gain on sale margin for Q1 2021. However, please note that UWMC’s tech could lead to margin expansion.

o I believe UWMC will fall roughly to 2.50-2.60%, but we will see on the 10th After Market. I do not mind a margin hit for market share gain, so long as that market share gain is sustainable OR the market share gain leads to revenue that offsets the gain on sale margin.

\- If LDI had no, or little, marketing expenses it would have had higher net income than Q4 2020. Rocket’s marketing expenses totaled 320 Million. They have such high marketing expenses because they are retail, whereas UWMC is wholly wholesale and thus their marketing costs are much, much, less.

\- Rocket got clobbered on their wholesale channel after UWMC’s ultimatum. The Wholesale Channel was one of their main growth drivers, especially in the purchase channel where they are exceptionally weak. (11 percent refinance, but only 3 percent of the purchase volume in the US).

o The Partner Network for Q1 2021 only provided 40.7B in originations (Please remember that this is not just wholesale but wholesale comprises a portion). Last Quarter the Partner Channel provided 37.9B in originations. That was a 7.3% increase, which is negligible when you consider that they probably only grew from their referral channel and from the increased percentage of their business that those who did not sign the addendum from UWMC gave.  You cannot have that when your direct-to-consumer channel decreased from 67.8B to 65B. Especially when your retail channel is the higher margin channel. Net revenue obviously decreased in their partner network from Q4 2020.

§ I cannot reiterate how bad this is for Rocket considering their aggressive growth was coming from this area. Especially since the broker channel surpassed 20 percent this year according to AMCs for the first time since 2008. It’s indicating to me that UWMC has won the broker war here, to be quite blunt, especially since UWMC’s CEO keeps reiterating that he has over 10,000 Brokerages partnered with him.

\- RKT gave disappointing Q2 guidance with a significant decrease in closed loan volume of between 82.5 Billion and 87.5 Billion. Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%.

o Quite frankly, considering UWMC has stated that Q2 is going to be very, very, good… I am concerned for Rocket, especially since there is a government program coming online this summer that will help low credit score and low-income people refinance which UWMC is taking advantage of. Furthermore, the wholesale broker channel is increasing, and more and more housing inventory is coming online. Lastly, home prices are increasing. If UWMC has a revenue beat and closed loan volume beat like LDI, or even meets Q1 on the higher end and guides upward for Q2, that means that Rocket is likely capped on the wholesale channel and thus in the purchase segment and that UJWMC is gaining ground.

My Thoughts Going into Earnings

Quite frankly, I am positively inclined. Which makes you all think I am a moron most likely. Well, in a vacuum, yes, it would be a moronic play. However, the market’s priced UWMC to fail partly because it is a mortgage company, partly because of the uncertainty with Rocket, and partly because it does not believe UWMC can beat expectations.

Let us first look at P/E Ratio. Rocket had a P/E of roughly 13-13.5, whereas UWMC has a P/E ratio of 6.27 if the 1.22 FY 2020 is right. Financial Services company have a P/E Ratio of 8-10. While Rocket is the number 1 mortgage lender (with some arguing it was even worthy of tech valuation???), UWMC is the number 1 mortgage lender in the wholesale space. However, the market was looking for Rocket to completely outperform like other stocks and for guidance to be spectacular, much like other companies. The Market is looking at UWMC like it is going to fail, as it is falling below even the most conservative ratio for a financial services company and has been trending downward in the leadup to earnings.

Another bearish sign from the market is the short interest of UWMC compared to RKT. RKT’s short interest is 7.87% since April 15 (April 30th SI data should be released any day now). For UWMC it is 13.10% of the float, and I am guessing it is going to show an increase on the 30th. Volume for UWMC is also significantly low from its average.

Which leads me to my next point. I believe in war you must strike fast, and strike hard, which UWMC did. However, markets do not like uncertainty, and the ultimatum that UJWMC gave introduced a lot of uncertainty. However, UWMC has made a lot of positive noises before Rocket’s earnings, and so I was comfortable that they were winning the wholesale mortgage market war. I also quite thoroughly enjoyed their share raising moves, and their willingness to raise capacity. I did not really see that with Rocket. However, Rocket had its buyback program whereas UWMC did not have that to fall to and it led to a negative feedback loop for UWMC where people gave up, short selling occurred, and there were not really any buybacks that UWMC could do as opposed to RKT to halt the bleeding. Ultimately, RKT’s earnings even led to a sympathy bleeding on UWMC in the After Hours. UWMC is down 1.79% to 7.66 after RKT’s earnings, even though these two companies are diametrically opposed, and the success of one boded ill for the other.

The first positive thing is that analysts’ earnings are primed to be blown out of the water for Q1 and FY 2021 as well as FY 2022. Q1 2021 has analysts expecting .42 or .47 depending on where you look, but I think that is a bit low. Especially when compared to Redwood Trust and LDI. I’m positively inclined here.

Furthermore, LDI used 200 Million to give a .69 Special Dividend, but the stock was trading over 20-22 dollars at the time, and its announcement of a Q2 dividend announcement of 8 cents a share was unappealing considering the share price. At the current share price of 18.11 LDI would give a 1.7% annual dividend. At the current share price LoanDepot is giving a 3.81% special dividend. Compare that to UWMC which is offering a dividend yield of 5.22%, and who has announced that they were looking at a special dividend, increased dividend, or even buybacks in Q4 2020 to reward shareholders if there was excess cash. After LDI and RKT both issued a special dividend, I feel UWMC will have no choice but to do so, and a special dividend of 200 Million to Class A shares equates to 4 dollars roughly. Even if Class D shares were involved, a 40-cent special dividend to both Class D and A shares would only cost 640 million.  However, I believe that the owner wants to keep as much money in the company as possible because he wants to invest it in the company which is why Class D shares do not have a dividend, but Class A shares do. If you are still unconvinced, I believe a timely look at RKT’s special dividend is in order as they issued the special dividend to only Class A shares (Public shares and not owner shares), and not the Class D shares that Dan Gilbert owns. This structure also allows an outsized special dividend.

I have 7.50 call Options with an average premium of 1.20. This would cost 123 million if issued to only Class A shares. In a vacuum, to profit I would only need a special dividend of $1.20, though this will not be in a vacuum. A special dividend that large would force people to cover if they are shorting, for one, and this special dividend would be issued under the auspices of Russell inclusion in late June, A strong Q1 and a very strong Q2 Guidance. Furthermore, as the normal dividend is announced the share price would elevate by that amount, before falling after the ex-dividend date. If the share price instead falls or remains flat, I can exercise my shares and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.

Mortgage Servicing Rights alone can service the dividend (41.5 Million per year), and the interest on the bonds (80 Million), while also allowing the company to further invest or allocate to bond principal. The Senior Notes are themselves easily repaid.

Ultimately, I have 4525 shares of UWMC that I have been continuously adding to, and I have 25 7.5 Calls for May 21 at an average of 1.20 that I have also been adding to including the last 2 days for both calls and shares. I am looking to add a call, and perhaps a tad more shares to UWMC. Yes, I am aware of IV Crush, and of Theta Decay. The theta decay stands at 1.9% which is acceptable to me, and I believe considering the confluence of events, the positive noises that the CEO has made for Q2 2021, the short interest, and the strong downward pressure on UWMC indicating the market believes the company will completely miss earnings, as well as the overt indication and peer pressure to issue a special dividend will ensure that the IV will remain elevated after earnings. I would not advise this for the faint of hearts, or if you have a kid on the way and life savings to burn, but this is one of the few times where buying calls from theta gang might mean they cry, and you fly (upward). With that said, be aware of IV Crush and be aware that I have allocated 3,127$ and might up this to 3,200 roughly considering Rocket’s earnings. I have nearly 40,000 in UWMC, so this is by no means a majority position. Furthermore, I am somewhat cushioned as this is not a weekly. To be clear, this is a YOLO, but a conservative one (sans the options). I also have money in my bank, so it is not like this will render me homeless.

I am not a financial advisor. Do what you will with this information.

I look forward to the earnings call on the 11th.

Big Update: The Dividend now stands at roughly 5.7%, and has a standalone p/e ratio of 17.5 which is equivalent to BAC. The Forward P/E at an analyst estimate of 1.22 is 5.73 for FY 2021 and a little lower for FY 2022. I believe that 2021 will have at minimum a EPS of 1.5, and so that gives a forward P/E of 4.67 for FY 21. ","['BAC', 'IR']"

n60urg,,wallstreetbets,post,1620282308,"CLOV - the biggest chance for a Gamma/short squeeze out there! Call OI and short float exceeding public float. + potential catalysts🎆Hi there apes,

So since the wrong SI% of float report came out, lots and lots of calls have been bought (maybe too many?). Right now the SI% of the float is actually still very high around 41% according to S3Partners, equal to 44.7m shares shorted. This leads me to the next thing, the total OI for calls is 598,882. If all these were to be executed that's 59.8m shares. So 59.8 (call OI) + 44.7(shares shorted) = 104.5m shares. The public float is 109.8m shares. Vanguard holds 26.2m shares. If you add these 26.2m shares to the 104.5m shares that is a total of = 130.7m shares. 20m+ shares MORE than the public float? Even if Vanguard sold covered calls on all their shares that would leave us with only 5.5m shares not being sold CC's on (not very likely) So this means lots and lots of these calls are sold naked!

For a gamma squeeze to happen you would need lots of calls at different strike prices, which CLOV has! Actually, it's insane to me how this many May and total calls have been sold, with literally no shares to back them up. Options table of CLOV below:

What could be the catalyst start all this? Well ER is on the 17th of May, so before all the may call expire. Furthermore, the DOJ investigation (what actually caused CLOV to go down in the first place) is now over. No PR yet, so I assume they will bring this up on ER!

Other than that, they have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive. On top of that Biden and democrats are looking to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.

This is not financial advise.  


Thank you to  [u/Goldendust](https://www.reddit.com/u/Goldendust/) for the amazing work they have done. I was able to make the following based on those 472 observations combined with my own 152 observations.

I have made a probability calculation of ownership just to give an illustration of what possible scenarios could be.   


Basically: Retail owns the float IMO.  
Warning: Math incoming  


The calculations go as follows.  
Engagement on the stock is 10 million because WSB membership sets this bar.  
I then estimate based on NO data other than personal sentiment that around 35% of engaged people hold onto the stock. So that gives us a maximum of 3.5 million active traders. This will be the premise for the following.  


The 624 total observations made by u/Goldendust \+ My own found average shares of people posting on YOLO updates or positions in GME to be around 664 shares held.  
Thats a high number (no DFV is not part of this data. I removed his 200k shares is i think they disrupt the average too much). So we are using it as the absolute maximum number of shares held in the most extreme scenario.  


So The following table shows on the y-axis:   


  


[Number of average shares in each scenario. I have applied a 5&#37; scaledown factor.](https://preview.redd.it/tbjfnq7odix61.png?width=77&format=png&auto=webp&s=44aa47283be1323b159fd37848523149b5fa9223)

&#x200B;

On the x axis 

&#x200B;

[X axis shows how many people of the total 3.5 million established maximum is holding in each scenario.](https://preview.redd.it/o8a2tsl0eix61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce6ecff44696b9091e4f6abc2cc50e1c7de286f)

  
So for instance   
the most extreme scenario of shares held is 664 shares held by all 3.5 million people or   
664 \* 3500000 = 2,324,000,000 shares held by retail investors.  


The most extreme scenario of not held i 0 people engaged and 0 shares held so 0.   


Now both these are very unlikely but they are used to built the following table.  


So the table shows us what the amount of shares held in each scenario would be.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wojg058deix61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=57242a65219566d61314a5c0f411aef7228ce82d

  
All the red cells show scenarios of retail owning Less than 46,000,000 shares which is the float.  


All the yellow cells show scenarios where retail owns equal to or less than the Float x2.  


All the green cells show scenarios where retail owns equal or more than Float x3.  


Then we examine how those scenarios come out in data.  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kwdsxb4feix61.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea374911242cb55de69e6218f6745a964337357

  
So basically. there is a 59% probability in the calculation that retail owns more than Float x2.  


  
I believe this is why transparency is important. If one was to make a SEC filing over concerns regarding market manipulation, a accurate look into float ownership compared to reported SI% would be a good method for showing that there is something very wrong here.  


I am not arguing for cooperation in terms of trading. I am arguing that legitimate concerns should be raised and brought to the attention of the SEC. A report which accurately depicts ownership of more than 2x float would be irrefutable proof that somewhere in the system something is wrong.  


I understand that this is unlikely to happen as it would require a trusted member of various communities.  


I will now await downvotes and fud callers.  
This was just me playing around with data. I personally only hold 4 shares.

Don't think you're smarter because you own lumber futures or $KHC calls. Questioning the Fed's power to do its job is a fool's errand at this point. It handily beat deflation during 2020's insanity. This is cake.

If there was ever a time for the market to question JPow, it was in late March 2020. There the problem was deflation with the outlook of a depression. The Fed never dealt with a shock like that before and had limited tools to fight it. Beyond pegging rates to zero, there wasn't much else. JPow and his team found the rocket dial on their money printer and turned it to full burn to blast the market out of its deflationary death spiral.

Now, the Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printer go brrrr. Paradoxically, this means they never have to actually use it.

Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. JPow doesn't want or need to spook markets. Given the credibility he now has in the market (after the 2020 miracle) and the infinite power the Fed generally has to fight inflation, the market will obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity. 🚀

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. They don't need omnipotence or need to be perfect. They have ample room for error. Still, being somewhat precise with today's data capabilities is like what having omnipotence and being perfect would be in the 70s (when we last had an inflation problem).

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrums. Also as grandpa Buffett pointed out, Treasury rates are still at 0.0000% with oversubscribed offerings. The Fed doesn't have to raise much at all, so interest on US debt will not become a problem when they do. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

TLDR: All the stonks that have crashed because the companies don't generate free cash flow will moon again. Market is about to do a headfake. MMs found a theme (inflation) to distract boomers (commodity futures) and retards (shit coins) together. Time to go full retard on beaten down stonks ($GME, $BB, $PLTR, $QS, etc.).",['KHC']

This a 1 sided game, always have been since fed was introduced, and now there’s more skin in the game than ever before so there’s a ton of motivation for asset prices to keep going up

You would be a genius if you would have bought lumber futures 10 months ago lol. If you are buying them now you are a fool",

Their Q1 was just released and they are already up +16%. I don't think this is the end of the run. A number of milestones have been hit over the last few weeks and this is a good play right now. This is not a COVID play, but they do have one in the works. Or maybe you want to be a 🌈🐻, try puts and lose money. 

[Three key milestones](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biocryst-reports-first-quarter-2021-110000484.html).

* Q1 2021 ORLADEYO (berotralstat) net revenue of $10.9 million
* ORLADEYO now approved in U.S., Japan and EU
* BioCryst reaches agreement with FDA that change from baseline in hemoglobin is the primary endpoint for pivotal PNH trials of oral BCX9930 set to begin in second half of 2021

This is not financial advice. I really like the bio-tech and I've been sitting on 21x May 21 12c, and 55 Jun 18 25c for a few weeks. But what do I know, I've been a boomer trader until 2021.",['BIO']
