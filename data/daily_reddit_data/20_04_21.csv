**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The median short interest in members of the S&P 500 sits at just 1.6% of market value, near a 17-year low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In Europe, a short-covering frenzy has sent bearish bets collapsing like never before in Morgan Stanley data.

At the same time, hedge-fund longs are around the highest relative levels in years at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s prime brokerage. They’re all signs of the bullish mania propelling global equities to fresh records this month, thanks to the economic re-opening and big policy stimulus. The smart money has little appetite to wager against either expensive or deadbeat companies -- especially after being lashed by the day-trader army earlier this year. “There’s just mass euphoria,” said Benn Dunn, president of Alpha Theory Advisors. “No one wants to get their head ripped off by a short anymore.”

musi47,gv7y4pu,stocks,comment,1618937320,""" I felt like this was a good approach, taking on tech, energy, data/security and transport ""

That's your problem. You took on tech, clean energy, data/security and transport (presumably EV's and autonomous driving??). Just like everyone else. It seemed like a sure thing, so everyone was flocking in. Not only retail investors but big investors as well. In the past year or two, we have seen so many new companies in these industries, so a lot of people, with a lot of money, though this was a sure thing as well, so you are in no way alone.

It's not that you are wrong (or at least I don't think so) in saying that these industries are going to shape the future. Where you went wrong was when you assumed that would also mean large short-term returns for investors.

The problem with hot industries is that everyone wants their slice of the cake, and the cake is only so large. So the slices become very small. Sure the few companies that do make it could dominate the space 20 years from now, but twenty years is not two months. That's another mistake you make, you worry too much about short-term price fluctuations. Another problem is that very few people, if any at all, could pick the google out of the 15 or so large search engines that were around 20 years ago. You might think ""that's why I have the ETF"" but that's another mistake. You think having a diverse portfolio of stocks in a tailwind sector is going to secure your returns. It won't. The problem goes back to the finite cake where everyone gets only a small slice, at least to begin with. Until winners start to emerge, which could take several years, you are going to see lots of competition and low margins across the whole industry.

The last obvious mistake was that you paid way too much. Price matters, price matters a lot. Think about it this way. When you go out to eat with your significant other, do you always go to the highest-rated, most expensive Michelin restaurant you can find, because you absolutely want the best no matter what? Or do you go for a much cheaper, but still excellent local restaurant? I would definitely go the much cheaper, but still excellent place, even if it's not the best thing I could possibly get. It's the same with a company. Every aspect of a company can be better than another, but if the price is too high you won't make money, or at least not very much of it. I'm not saying buy shitty but cheap companies, but I am saying you should buy great businesses at fair prices, or decent businesses at great prices.

Peter Lynch once said that ""if something seems like a sure thing, it's usually a good time to sell"". Because people always bid ""the next big thing"" up way too high, which means it's eventually comes back down to something more reasonable, especially if the space becomes overcrowded, which it often does.",['GOOGL']

munvr5,,stocks,post,1618916639,"Stem Inc ($STPK) DD**Stem Inc - Due Diligence**

Stem Inc (ticker STPK) was established in 2009 and is a provider of battery storage and AI optimisation software to Utilities and Large Corporates (including Amazon, Facebook and UPS) in the US, Canada and Japan.

**Total Addressable Market and Market Position**

Stem is the market leader in the fast-growing energy storage market. Wood Mackenzie forecast a Total Addressable Market for energy storage of $1.2 trillion by 2050, and for the battery storage market to increase by 25x by 2030. The size of Stem’s market is rapidly expanding due to:

1. The declining cost of batteries, driving increased adoption. This is already happening with Electric Vehicle batteries, and the same economies of scale are benefiting Stem. Batteries are now increasingly being installed with solar and wind to reduce their intermittency
2. Stem is expecting to see the introduction of a standalone investment tax credit in the US for clean energy storage, allowing storage to be eligible for tax concessions (matching the concessions available to solar & wind). This is expected to open up a variety of new markets in the US.
3. The Biden administration has proposed a $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid, putting the US on a path to achieving 100% carbon free electricity. Batteries and smart software are required to manage renewable’s intermittency.
4. Broader Clean Energy / ESG mandate from large corporates and governments worldwide. There will be plenty of macro catalysts for Stem in the coming years

Stem is the market leader with 75% market share in the Californian battery storage market (larger than their next 4 competitors combined), with California being the largest market in the US. Stem has a first mover advantage, as they’re already operating with over 40 utilities, 5 grid operators, for a cumulative total of more than 20 million run-time hours. This is the equivalent to Stem already operating 12 gas peaker plants (1 GWH).

Stem sources batteries from Tier 1 manufacturers, including LG, Tesla and Samsung. They are one of the largest purchasers of utility grade batteries in the US, and are agnostic on who’s batteries they install – their software can attach to nearly any battery. In terms of their supplier’s bargaining power, they see Tesla as operating in a different market to them. Tesla is seen as doing much larger projects, such as the Australian ‘Big Battery’. They also see Tesla as primarily a manufacturer, who’s trying to scale their output (similar to how Foxconn is a manufacturer to Apple). They’re also not dependent upon Tesla batteries, as they can switch to other suppliers. Interestingly, they believe they introduced Tesla to the Japanese market!

**Stem’s Competitive Advantage – Athena AI**

Essentially Stem’s business model is supplying and installing a Battery and AI Software bundle. Stem’s AI software, called Athena, is their competitive advantage over other battery providers.

Athena is a propriety, patented, AI optimisation software which Stem bundle with battery installation. Athena analyses large data sets (over 700,000 data points per second) in real time to optimise electricity flows. It takes into account energy prices, grid dynamics, weather, and customer usage patterns to lower their electricity costs by up to 30%.

It does this, by example, by taking advantage of electricity price fluctuations. Very simply, Athena will instruct batteries to charge when prices are low (say during the day when solar panels are generating lots of surplus power) and discharge into the grid when prices are high (say during the evening when solar is off). This electricity market participation creates value for their customers and for Stem. There are 13 ways in which Athena creates value for customers, with this just being a simple example of a price arbitrage scenario.

I believe Athena has a strong competitive ‘moat’ due to:

1. Athena is attached to 100% of Stem’s battery sales, and at no point has a customer ever asked for the software to be removed. Stem has 75% market share of the Californian battery storage market, illustrating the strong demand for Athena
2. Athena generates 80% Gross Margins, which demonstrates both the lack of substitute software solutions and the value that customers place on Athena
3. Athena gets better with more use. There are more than 950 systems operating or contracted with Athena, which have collectively generated more than 20 million runtime hours of data, generating a wealth of data to train and improve Athena. This data itself is a source of competitive advantage, with battery suppliers reportedly seeking to purchase this data from Stem. Competitors simply don’t have this data, don’t have a market leading position to generate this data, and don’t have the luxury of time to make up the shortfall.

**Strengthened Balance sheet**

The main tangible benefit of the merger with Star Peak Energy Transition Corp (ticker STPK) is the cash – Stem has a war chest of $525m to pursue growth. Stem is going to use these funds to grow in 4 tangible ways

1. Reduction in Working Capital. Prior to its strengthened balance sheet, Stem had to pay 100% for batteries up-front, and wouldn’t get paid by the customer until the project was complete. This meant Stem had to fund the holding cost of the battery purchase for several months, which curtailed their growth. With its stronger balance sheet, Stem expects to negotiate better deals with its supplier’s, driving a $100m improvement in working capital over the next 24 months
2. Bid on larger projects. Multiple times in the past, large utility owners have curtailed Stem’s level of participation on projects due to a lack of balance sheet strength. This cut Stem’s project participation to just 30%, 40% or 50%. However, going forward with the stronger balance sheet, they expect to land larger opportunities
3. Further investment in Athena, to extend its market leading position
4. International expansion

**Valuation**

Stem has provided guidance to 2026, with a Revenue CAGR of 80% from 2020 to 2026. 2021 revenue is expected to be 4.5x 2020 revenue. 2021’s revenue is already secured by signed customer contracts – Stem is actively is executing on these. Further confidence in revenue forecasts comes from a contracted backlog of $200m (as of 17 January 2021).

Revenue quality is underpinned by Stem’s contracting model - Athena is provided on a 10 to 20 year subscription term in conjunction with the battery sale. This provides significant and predictable long term cash flows beyond just an upfront battery sale.

A Discount Cash Flow analysis of their Free Cash Flow forecast, plus their $525m cash, equates to **$47.80/share** (8% discount rate, 2.5% perpetual growth rate), representing substantial upside from the current stock price. Upside to this target is possible from market expansion and government policy changes, including:

1. Movement into residential properties. This is an untapped market, with Stem actively considering how best to enter this market. Entry into the residential market is not included in their FCF
2. Upside from the proposed energy storage investment tax credit. Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office
3. Upside from Biden’s proposed $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid. Similarly, Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office

mur47t,,stocks,post,1618927651,"The potential bear cases for uranium and subsequent counter argumentsWhen considering what things to invest in or not invest in, one has to consider in what way they can be wrong, rather than just focus on how they can be right. This makes sure that you are aware of the downside risk should one or two things go against you and derail the initial investment thesis. I have covered uranium on Reddit for almost a year now and addressed numerous of these bear cases, while simultaneously looking for one myself as well. Because I realize going back through all my posts and reading hundreds of comments is a course of action that few if any of you, understandably, have time for, I wanted to share with you a recent write up provided by John Quaks (quakes99 on Twitter). After talking to John, he was fine with it being shared on here as well in order to provide value to more people. He lays out the potential bear cases in a well written sense and it embodies everything (and more) of the things that I have discussed on here as well. Now, onto the write up:

The bull case for Uranium seems as rock solid as they come for any commodity. Years of  
 underinvestment and low uranium prices have led to long term mine suspensions that have pushed  
 mined supply to a 12-year low while global nuclear capacity has risen every year for the past 8 years to push uranium demand back to pre-Fukushima levels once again. Analysts now predict that uranium will be in a sustained multi-year supply deficit made worse by depletion of existing mines and continuing delays in building the new mines needed to bring supply back into balance with demand.

 Idled mines need signed contracts closer to US$50/lb before they can commit to raising capital and  
 hiring new mine workers needed to bring their long-dormant mines safely back into production. Mine restarts are costly and it can take a few years to cycle back up to nameplate capacity, and on their own are insufficient to bring mined supply back high enough to meet rising demand.  
 Decisions to bring new mines into production are even more daunting with requirements for new capital investment of US$5 Billion plus to develop, permit, and build enough new mines and processing facilities to replace mined capacity set to close over the next decade and fill the estimated over 100 Million pounds per year mined supply deficit projected for 2035 based on a modest nuclear capacity growth rate of 1.5% per annum.

 In order for shareholders, Boards and lenders to give a new mine a construction ""green light there will need to be signed offtakes and long term contracts in the US$60+ range before committing to spending billions of dollars and hiring and training thousands of new mine workers. Even after construction go-aheads are given it will still take several years for new mines and mills to be built and eventually achieve their production targets.

 With uranium prices hovering around $30 per pound today, assuming a conservative nuclear growth  
 model, at least a doubling of U308 prices will be needed to bring idled mines back into operating and  
 incentivize enough new mines to begin construction and achieve their production capacity by the end of the decade. TradeTech has stated that they believe that 80 to 90 percent of all the uranium mine projects that exist today must be brought into production to meet future demand, many of which require uranium prices higher than $60/1b. Given the permitting political and funding challenges that all mine projects must face, only a small number of projects identified today will likely be successful in being constructed and achieving their projected production goals.

 Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel summed it up by saying that the world needs to discover, develop, and  
 commission about 6 McArthur Rivers or Cigar Lakes in the next 15 years. That's new production of 108 Million pounds per year by 2035. The chances of that happening are slim to none even if uranium prices spike well beyond $60/1b to $100 or even $200 or more. No matter the price of uranium, there must be mine construction approvals, political support and certainty, billions of dollars in necessary investment many years to build mines and mills, hire and train mine workers as well as the inevitable unanticipated setbacks and delays which seem to plaque new mine construction Taken together, this is the rock solid bull case for uranium over the next decade or more. It doesn't even take into account the impact of an emerging global embracing of nuclear power to decarbonize economies to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions in the fight against Climate Change. A new global Nuclear Renaissance to satisfy the baseload carbon free energy required to electrify everything would make it all but impossible for mined uranium supply to ever catch up with rapidly growing demand added by the mass deployment of factory built advanced Generation I reactors small and micro modular reactors. A massive effort towards recycling of spent fuel to create a fully dosed fuel cycle would be needed to find the technological solutions to overcome the constraints on uranium supply.

 The bull case is clear to see, but what about the bear case? What if anything, might there be that  
 could derail the inevitability of the uranium bull market? As uranium is a cyclical commodity that goes through boom and bust cycles based on changes to supply and/or demand, we can approach the question by looking at both side of the equation separately. On the nuclear demand side, the obvious potential show-stopper for the uranium bull market would be another major nuclear incident. However, whether such an event derails or instead temporarily delays the bull market boom cycle is another question. With 444 nuclear reactors in operation and another 54 already funded and under construction, a nuclear accident would have to be significant enough to lead  
 to the shutting down of dozens of operating reactors and suspension or cancellation of many new  
 reactor builds in order to put an end to a uranium bull market. Mined supply is in such a deep deficit  
 that in the order of 70 currently operating reactors would need to be permanently shut down to match the estimated 35 Million pounds per year sustained supply deficit so as to prevent a further rise in uranium prices.

 Looking back at Fukushima, one has to keep in mind that it was the shutdown of Japan's 54 reactors, and decisions by Germany and some other nations to follow suit that derailed the nuclear renaissance that was underway back in 2011. It wasn't simply sentiment towards nuclear but a real change to uranium demand that sent U308 into an oversupply situation that drove down prices and led to shutting down mines and shelving mine development projects. A minor nuclear accident lacking in catastrophic outcomes would not likely be sufficient to change the trajectory of uranium prices today. Since Fukushima, billions of dollars have been invested by Japan and other western nations to undertake engineering studies, upgrade reactors and improve safety and security, so the likelihood of a major catastrophic nuclear incident is lower now than it was a decade ago.

 Other bearish events on the nuclear demand side would be a decision by China to abandon its  
 accelerated nuclear build program and/or cancel its planned and approved reactor construction projects. Similarly, a decision by the US, Europe India and/or Russia to withdraw support for their nuclear industry, retire nuclear power plants early abandon plans to life-extend the current reactor fleet to 80+ years or any major global shift in sentiment away from nuclear could put downward pressure on demand. As it stands today, there are no signs of that happening as the world is now taking a second look at embracing nuclear as a key solution to fight climate change.

What of nuclear Fusion to replace the world's Fission reactors? Anyone following the history of fission based nuclear power knows that it can take decades to prove up new technology develop the necessary regulatory framework establish safe and proven operating guidelines build and demonstrate a working commercial unit that harnesses the heat of the sun in a small reactor footprint that is not a risk to the environment and humanity. In my view we are decades away from achieving that goal and in the meantime all exsting nuclear reactors will continue to operate and more fission reactors will be built.

 As previously discussed the current bull market set up does not account for the introduction of  
 advanced Gen I reactors such as small modular reactors so any movement away from SMRS or failure  
 to deliver on expectations would do nothing at all to change the uranium supply dynamics as they are today. Similarly a deviation into alternative fuels for these new reactors in the 2030's does nothing to change the uranium supply vs demand dynamics of this decade.The uranium supply side, though more difficult to assess due to its inherent lack of visibility, does have a number of potentially bearish events to consider. The bear case that sits at the top of the list has been around for many years since before Kazakhstan moved to privatize its uranium mining industry, create a Swiss trading arm, and initiate a ""value over volume strategy of year-after-year flex-downs in supply. The argument is that Kazakhstan will simply ramp up its low-cost production to fill the supply gap and  
 prevent any further upward movement in uranium prices. In the pre-privatization era that might be a potential show-stopper but is it really today? Kazakhstan's current resources and production capacity is assigned an upward limit of about 73 Million pounds per year by its government as reported to the IAEA and by Kazatomprom to its investors. That's just 15 Million pounds per year above its current 58 Million pounds ""flex down"" level that has been extended through the end of 2022. Even if Kazatomprom were to take the irrational business decision to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to ""flex up"" production to its 73 Million pounds maximum so as to push down uranium prices, punish its bottom line and eliminate its dividend, it would still not be sufficient to fill the multi-year sustained supply gap that will continue to worsen over the coming decade. 

Similarly, other state-owned producers like Uzbekistan lack sufficient resources and production capacity to ramp up production to fill the supply gap. The Uzbeks announced last week that they are going to proceed with their plan to privatize their state-owned uranium mining company in the way Kazakhstan has done, so it appears the ""value over volume movement is gaining more momentum that further argues against this bear case.

 Barring some miraculous increase in mined uranium supply, the other sources of supply that could  
 potentially rise would be in Secondary Supply or some unknown hoarded inventory that a uranium player decides to release into the market. Japan has long been argued as a potential source of a large volume of uranium to be sold into the market but the evidence of that has been little to none. Having invested in a large inventory at much higher prices, and with majority of that inventory already in the form of fabricated fuel assemblies custom made for each unique reactor, Japanese utilities would need to take considerable losses if they chose to liquidate, and would also need to pay to have fuel rods disassembled and even then the enriched uranium contained therein would not likely be directly useful to a buyer in its current state. With Japan moving to restart more reactors and achieve a higher nuclear contribution level to achieve its own Net Zero carbon emissions goals, it seems more likely they will continue to hold on to all available ""fully paid for"" inventory to fuel their restarted reactors over the coming decade and even buy more uranium as more units are restarted.

 On Secondary Supply, the main source has been underfeeding in the uranium enrichment process and re-enrichment of depleted tails. I'm no expert in this area but my research shows that when there is a lack of demand for enrichment services, the enrichers will use that excess capacity in their centrifuges to ""underleed"" at the front end of an enrichment order and then sell the unused feed into the Spot market or offer it to other customers as a feed source at market prices. The key factor is that it is not technically possible to simply shut down centrifuges to save money. They must be kept spinning. Enrichers can recover their power costs by underfeeding to produce saleable matenal or reprocess depleted tails as a way to generate offsetting cash flow. If nuclear utilities continue to delay their contracting for enrichment services then underfeeding and tails re-enrichment will continue to produce secondary supply to dampen a uranium price rise. However arising SWU enrichment price and an expected rise in contracting after years of delays is expected by majority of analysts and nuclear fuel consultants to lead to a reduction in Secondary Supply over the coming years.  
 

A possible bear case event that could side-swipe the recovery in uranium prices would be the  
 announcement of another Megatons to Megawatts program by the US and/or Russia. This would involve the downblending of weapons grade (95%+ enriched uranium) down to the 5-7% level in order to make nuclear reactor fuel. This was done for 20 years from 1993-2013 and acted as a virtual uranium mine producing around 25 Million pounds per year, fueling half the US nuclear reactor fleet for 2 decades. If some new denuclearization effort were to emerge then this could happen again, but as things stand today it seems highly unlikely.

 Another possible bearish event would be the emergence of new inexpensive technology that could be used to convert nuclear waste and stockpiles of depleted uranium into nuclear reactor fuel. Companies are working on Laser Enrichment as such a technology that could revolutionize the enrichment industry and, if successful, help to produce more Secondary Supply to meet reactor fuel needs. As it stands, the processes involved are very expensive, and still many years away, which makes mining raw uranium, converting and enriching into reactor fuel using the establish nuclear fuel cycle of today, the cheapest way to go at the present time. When uranium prices spike far higher, expensive sources of secondary supply become more economically viable, but that makes this bear case dependent on there being a strong uranium bull market in the first place.

 What of Thorium as a replacement fuel? Thorium has been promoted as a better fuel source than  
 uranium but to this day it has not taken off into commercial use so the jury remains out on thorium  
 reactors as being economically or practically viable. The global nuclear industry has invested trillions of dollars into reactors, ennchment conversion and nuclear fuel fabrication facilities all based on uranium as the fuel source. There is incredibly strong inertia for that to continue into the future. Thorium has its own issues as well which have yet to be overcome. Converting the 500 operating & under construction reactors to operate on a different fuel is just not happening. There is no substitute for uranium today. Some point to recent news that uranium can be extracted from seawater as a bearish new technology to derail a bull market but the data on its development says otherwise. So far only very small quantities (grams) of uranium have been successfully extracted from large quantities of seawater. Producing tens of millions of pounds of fuel-grade uranium still appears to be decades away if a successful process can be developed on a large scale. The economics and environmental impact of such an industry are still big unknowns yet to be determined, so there is little likelihood of this emerging technology in its infancy today becoming a supply disruptor this decade though future prospects are encouraging.

 There are always going to be possible geopolitical events that can change the flow of uranium supply  
 and have a significant impact on nuclear fuel demand. Those were an issue decades ago heading into  
 the last uranium bull market and are just as probable today. However I think it is safe to say that  
 geopolitics sides with the uranium bull thesis as it more than likely involves disruption to supply than the opening up of some new source of uranium to meet global demand. The standard uranium  
 supply/demand models built by analysts assume smooth sailing for mine development activities, no  
 uranium trade issues and steady as she goes in terms of geopolitics History shows us that things rarely go as planned which I believe further strengthens the bull case investing thesis for uranium to be rock solid commodity for investors this decade. Those are a few of the bull and bear case arguments re explored.

TLDR: You made it to the end and I hope it was informative. The conclusion of this write up is quite simple really. While yes, there are several bear cases that could be considered when investing in uranium, all of them have solid counterarguments that have to be considered as a counterweight to those. There are few, if any, solid bear cases which will derail this investment thesis outside of the risk that we see a significant meltdown of another nuclear power plant. This thesis is getting stronger by the day and while equities have already ran up a lot and are due for a big more of a correction in the short term, the 3 to 4 year trend is clearly upwards and I will stick by the take I shared in October of last year, that uranium will be the best performing broad investment asset class from that point until roughly 2024/2025. Please remember to always do your own due diligence as none of this is investment advice and conviction cannot be copied. Hope you all have a great rest of your day and best of luck out there.","['GPS', 'LB', 'TWTR']"

Housing is fucking nuts in the past year as people move out of the cities and into suburbs across America and the world. This has led to great plays like UWMC or RKT, which have had their time and I would still argue are undervalued but that's not the point right now. 

As the housing demand went so high, each industry involved in housing shot up; mortgages are the most recent example, with RKT doubling in a week and UWMC seeing a 40% week earlier this march. Homebuilders like [TOL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOL/) and [LEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LEN/) have also seen enormous runups. These all make sense because houses are expensive and the volume moving on the market is obscene. The next logical step is not far from what the vitards pulled off with the steel plays like $MT: directing your attention at the most base material for all this shit.

**Stocks in question**

The stocks in mind are UFP Industries ($UFPI), a Michigan based wood and wood alternative producer, and Louisiana Pacific (LPX), a Tennessee based lumber product producer. I picked these two because they've both got solid results over the past year, are substantial companies, and have earnings coming as soon as tomorrow after close for UFPI. Their products go into American houses at every step, from the main beams to the siding, [and lumber has only gotten more expensive in the past year.](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber)

Lumber futures also signal that this will continue for a while: 

>Even the May 2022 contract, a full year out the curve from the current spot month, is priced at “only” a 25 percent discount. None of this is good news for builders or other professional buyers of nearly all grades of lumber, because they’ve got to have lumber to build, and the building season is hitting full stride as the calendar advances. These folks are paying up because they have no alternative, and there is no indication this trend will end anytime soon. The pros who use lumber will continue to buy what they need, if they can get it, even at elevated price levels.

The futures price of lumber regardless, there is a lumber shortage and those who stand to gain the most are those who produce it. Homebuilders too may suffer

> American Homes 4 Rent, which built more than 1,600 rentals last year and plans to construct another 2,000 houses this year, said its lumber bill is between $20,000 and $25,000 per house, up from about $10,000.

^https://www.wsj.com/articles/commodities-boom-hits-home-11615973404

Another nice thing is that LPX and UFPI have a p/e ratio of ~15 and ~20 respectively, so you're not buying into some overpriced trash shit even in this market of nutty valuations.

**Short Interest**

Don't ask me about the fucking short interest

**Positions to capitalize**

UFPI posts its Q1 2021 earnings tomorrow. Whereas lumber futures traded from 550-660 for most of Q4 '20, they rocketed up at the end of december and have traded between 668 at a low to nearly 1000 by the end of the quarter. For this reason, I believe that a strong earnings beat is very likely for UFPI, and calls would be great but the fact that they are only available for May 21 kind of is a a ball buster. I'm buying calls only but that's because I am poor

For LPX, they have earnings in May, but its not unreasonable to treat them the same. It is best to save the trouble of theta decay and wait to buy calls, but if UFPI smashes earnings then LPX may go up in expectations of a similar earnings beat as they have significant crossover in their products.

Most companies have been consistently beating earnings estimate since covid spread as people were given free money also to buy what they want while tech companies massively benefitted from the lockdowns. Even banks continue to report blow out earnings when most expected them to suffer. 

Lastly, the stock market euphoria that covid crisis caused resulted into companies being able to offer tons of additional shares at high prices to pay off debt or expand, market participants mostly didn't care and they just all absorbed the dilutions left and right, insiders were also very happy to sell at high prices. IPO and blank check mania also allowed companies to have ridiculously high valuations so they were able to raise large amount of funds.",

A tiny, economically insignificant country like New Zealand makes up 8% of holdings.

Germany is 2%?! the UK - a global leader in clean energy - is only another 3%.

What's missing is a country like Japan with some behemoth battery manufacturers like Panasonic and NGK. Sure, ""clean"" isn't a buzzword in those companies' sectors but they are vital players in the sector.

It's a confusing story with companies like Plug and Ballard power. Hydrogen? Fuel cells? the EV market is exploding and these companies are harping on about tech with a questionable future at best.

The problem is that many clean energy companies are not publicly traded which is why this index is so lopsided.

I want to hear your opinions and examples, thank you! 🙏",
mumrvu,gv6rr9i,stocks,comment,1618915917,"Firstly, congratulations for taking this step at a very young age! You must definitely be proud of this decision you made.
Secondly, and most importantly, forget about this flawed explanation you’ve heard almost every amateur tell others “when you’re young be aggressive” or “put money into stocks you’re willing to lose”. That is one of the most popular lies people tell each other rather than admit they don’t know what they are doing. 
I mean why would you invest when your goal is to grow your money, but you hear others “advice” you there is always the risk you might lose it all 🙄 That is not investing at all. 
There is a book by the legendary Jack C. Bogle called “The Little book on Common Sense Investing”. I want you to find the strength and the discipline to study that book, not just read it for the sake of telling others you read it. That book will open your eyes to the foolishness of majority of the market participants, and save you from making the mistakes most of us make. 
You’ve taken the step in the right direction at such a young age, sir. Don’t make mistakes listening to unprofessional advice. Every, and I mean every single successful investor will tell you, their success was not because they picked winning stocks or they discovered some magical formula. Their success was simply because they made very few mistakes throughout their investment lifetime and grew their wealth over time. 

Good luck to you!

mumrvu,gv7jogs,stocks,comment,1618931281,"Not sure what your entry point is in terms of $, but as an 18 year old, your life is lightspeed right now and you really need to enjoy the moments. Not saying that this shouldn't become a prime hobby or even a ""career"", but I'd honestly put my money in a managed brokerage account. Yes, you pay a small management fee off the top, but they'll set you up with a diversified portfolio based off your risk tolerance levels. As an 18 year old, basics say to be aggressive because you have ALOT of time left on the game clock. But I'd honestly let a firm manage 80% of your account, And you keep 20% to learn on your own. And then, given enough time and experience, you might feel comfortable to take the reins entirely.

My biggest mistake was keeping cash in a checking account in my early 20s, because I was too afraid and incompetent on what to do with it. Put it into a managed account to let it start working for you, while you keep a small sliver of it to ""live and learn"" with.

Just my two cents. You'll get full exposure (large, mid, small cap, US based, internatoinal, value, growth, and even some bond exposure too). That's where you want to start building that massive nest...and at 18, you're doing it which is so important for long term wealth management.

Think of it as that. Wealth management (even if you don't think it's ""wealth""). You need to think long term. Let someone manage it for a few years while you day/week trade on the side a bit. Don't ""live and learn"" with all of it. You can live and learn with just 20% and then put the remaining 80% into a managed account (and watch how they manage it...you'll learn alot from just watching your own managed account and the decisions those algorithms make).

I'm in my mid 30s, kids, house, cars, etc...the whole ""upper"" middle class shebang. And, like I said, I didn't start investing until around 25. But through ""dollar cost averaging"" (learn this term) through monthly contributions to my managed account, I'm seeing 6 figures of literally just ""play"" money. It's not retirement (which I also have in the form of both a Roth and 401k), and it's not a rainy day fund (which I've built and stashed in a money market account). It is literally my ""wealth"" management account that my wife and I don't have earmarked for anything in particular. Our monthly cash flow covers all expenses and we make contributions to all our accounts without fault.

We still don't have a plan for the account, but it really is just there to build long term wealth, and we will continue to DCA the account, through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Our retirement accounts should see us be millionaires at retirement, while this managed account should see us be multi-millionaires by retirement. We still have about 30 years of employment left, so plenty of time to go through crashes/bears and bulls. But the important aspect to wealth growth is stable cash flow (employment and budgeting) and monthly contribution to retirement and investment accounts (DCA).

Starting at 18, and you should be ahead of us by a decade if nothing insane happens.",

The question you asked is something a lot of people have and it’s unfortunate that popular media or information readily available makes you “feel” like you’re missing out on growing your portfolio because you’re not invested more into Growth stocks and ETFs.
I’m sure you will get plenty of “advice” from people here, or on social media or you might read articles that “tell”you to buy this stock or that ETF “before” the next run-up/ rally..
Lol this is how this industry makes money. Makes everyone feel like they should act immediately or they will miss out. The unfortunate reality is that “Investing in the stock market” and building wealth from it is only something that can be taught through experience. It is a painfully slow time consuming process that cannot rushed whatsoever. 

Maybe a couple of years from you, you could reflect back to this day when you posted this question and go through all the replies you received and you might actually act on something you heard or read from here. When you reflect back to this day, hopefully you will remember that some stranger in the Internet wasted your time because he didn’t give you a tip on the next “hottest growth stock or ETF”, but he encouraged you to study (actually study) about successful investors like Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, John C. Bogle, Benjamin Graham, and others....

Eventually, you’ll learn about this undeniable statistic of the stock market called “Reversion to the mean” (lmao yes one of those boring statistics formula you had to memorize in high school or college to pass that even more boring class).

I wish you the very best on your investment journey and I sincerely do hope you make less mistakes on your way to greatness so you can keep most of the wealth you earned.

mumgcc,,stocks,post,1618910296,"Academic Research on Motley Fool**TLDR: We can all agree Motley Fool's advertising is shit, but Academic Research seems to suggest their track record holds up to scrutiny. They focus on smaller stocks and holding them, which can be replicated, though research is difficult for some smaller companies.**

It seems to be a recurring discussion theme which /r/stocks visits, and everytime people who've never had anything to do with Motley Fool, and have never looked past their shitty clickbait ads always make claims like Motley Fool is as good as flushing your money down a sink. Or Motley Fool is a scam.

Now disclosure, I've never used their premium service, but I wanted to go beyond what potato123 on /r/stocks claims, and decided to do a cursory search on it.

[Turns out there's a research paper comparing the Fool's performance to the S&P 500.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%27s_Stock_Advisor)

The main findings from it can be summarized as below:

**Average Monthly Returns from 2002-2016:**

**Motley Fool Picks: 1.13%**

**Picks based on IBES recommendations: 1.21%**

**S&P 500: 0.48%**

So while the fool doubled the S&P500, it was beaten by IBES recommendations (which most people should be able to access through their broker (atleast you can here in Australia)).

They tend to pick a lot more smaller market caps though, which is why the IBES recommended matched portfolio comes out similar, since holding larger companies has underperformed finding smallcaps and holding them long.

In summary, Motley Fool does seem to be good at identifying the ones outside the mainstream, but if you have the background/experience, you may be able to get similar outperformance when investing in smallcaps and holding. The hurdle ofcourse is finding these, and having the research into them.",['SPGI']

If you are doing this over the course of one day, it is considered a day trade and restricted to 3 buys/sells over 5 days. If you maintain a balance of over 25 thousand then the 3 trade rule doesn’t apply to you. The other restriction would be buying new stock with money from a sell that hasn’t settled. The settle rule is Trade day plus 2 business days.  If you buy a stock at 9am, sell it at a profit at 2pm and buy another stock with that money, that is not allowed...well it is but if you do it a certain number of times they will block you from doing that for 90 days.

3) I would recommend your first 5-10k go into index/mutual funds. They make money slower but much safer. However you can still make hundreds a week if you find good ones. 

If you want to start to identify good stocks and learn which ones to target, watch Jim Cramer. His stocks usually have safe and good returns. Paying for his more in-depth analysis may be worth it.

mu9x64,,stocks,post,1618864601,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 19, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 19, 2021**

Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) retreating from record levels with the benchmark Treasury yield climbing and market participants taking profits off the table after the recent record run. Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. 

Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

**Highlights**

* Notable earnings for tomorrow: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), P&G (PG), Abbott (ABT),  Netflix (NFLX), Interactive Brokers (IBKR), Silvergate (SI)
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) slumped more than 6% before recovering throughout the day after reports that two people died after a driverless Tesla crashed in Texas
* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.
* China’s market regulator is investigating a joint venture between e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and Minmetals Development, amid a broad antitrust clampdown on internet firms in China.
* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

>Sky News has learnt that Soho House this week submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) in New York that will value it at more than $3bn (£2.1bn).

>Banking sources said on Thursday that the flotation, which will crystallise a big paper windfall for the company's founder, Nick Jones, could reach a valuation of as much as $4bn (£2.9bn).

>The company considered an IPO two years ago but opted to raise capital privately instead.

>Despite the pandemic forcing many of its clubs around the world to close, the business has proved to be resilient, with barely 10% of its 110,000 members cancelling their subscription.

Didn't see a post about this, think it flew under the radar a bit. Luxury goods/services seems to have grown massively in the pandemic somehow. 

Not sure about this one, I'm a fan of Soho House as a place to go, would be nice to get a membership, but their entire business is based around going down there in person, using the facilities they have provided, can't use any of it at home AFAIK. 

Could be a good recovery stock though, post pandemic when flights resume the network could be handy for members, it's so hard to get a membership that I suspect a lot of people didn't cancel because they would never get it back if they did.

My only advice would be to risk only what you can afford to lose in a gambling trade like that. If you know that you wouldn’t miss the money if the stock drops 50% (which routinely happens on small biotech companies), then go ahead and trade those. But if you want to protect your capital, invest in companies with a proven track record of revenues and profits. And ignore shorting, it is a very inconsistent indicator of future performance.",

How the same stat got thrown in my face over and over, ""95% of traders don't beat the market."" From what I understand, there is merit to this fact.

Because of this I've stacked up VTI/VTSAX, VGTSX, and VOO. Since inception, I've averaged 13% YOY. The gains are impressive since I started in about 2011-2012, with heavier contributions each year as my job came with higher salary over the years.

My question is why are subs like [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and such so popular, constantly everyday people posting about their super niche tailored portfolios with DD on random companies. And it seems there is a herd like mentality in these subs as well.

Tech stocks go up - all the DD and posts are about tech stocks - everyone is bullish in tech....until its not

Tech stocks go down - tons of QQ and posts about ""how is the market going up and I'm down 15%?"" - with comments talking about OP lacking diversification.

**Again if 95% of traders don't beat the market, why are so many people trying?**

Some things that I may not full grasp:

* Are regular people building their custom portfolios, picking individual stocks not considered traders?
* The market has inefficiencies - does this invalidate the ""95% stat?""
* Does the ""95% stat"" only apply to professionals? And by some weird way allow retail average Joes better opportunity?
* Why does the consensus on all the finance subs seem to be centered around building your own portfolio?
* Are 19/20 people in these subs really failing to beat the market?

Today, my friend made me realize in the last 8 years, VFV.TO has BADLY outperformed the VOO. Voo gained around 150%, while VFV.TO gained over 300%.


The exact reason is difficult to understand, but here is my theory:


When we have bad red days like today, the VOO will often crash fairly hard.... and VFV.TO will go down a lot less, because the US dollar is generally bullish when the market goes down. For example, today, we can see that VOO is down a lot more than VFV.TO.


Obviously, VOO does recover a lot more than VFV.TO once we get to a green day... however, as we all know, losing 50% and recovering 50% isn't the same as losing 25% and then recovering 25%. the later is way better for you.


My question: Am right in thinking VFV.TO is the better long term option over VOO?


EDIT: NVM my whole theory is terrible. In 2015 the US dollar was worth the same as today, and there was no difference in performance between the 2 funds. Only reason VFV outperformed VOO so badly is 2012 to 2015 the US dollar gained value.",

So, can people time the market? Sort of, but timing the top or the bottom is impossible.

mu15nv,gv35sr6,stocks,comment,1618844043,"I learned my lesson during the Dotcom bubble.  I thought I was a ""F""-ing genius with QCOM and few others from 1998-2000 and all the Y2K hoopla.   In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop -  ""I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip""; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.

It taught me a valuable lesson, **max out retirement accounts** with low cost mutual funds and **save 15% cash of yearly income** for emergencies, after that than **purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends**.

Then and only then  develop a \~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD.  For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by \~15% I am out but will watch).  On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)

So when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out.  Retiring early and been enjoying the good life.

Today, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active.

Good Luck.

mu15nv,gv34bg9,stocks,comment,1618843399,"In my opinion, the best approach to take is based on risk management. As markets become more and more overvalued, the upside potential goes down while the downside risk goes up. Also, the number of good investment opportunities goes down. As this happens your portfolio will naturally start to accumulate cash as you take profits from positions that no longer have a positive future outlook while it becomes harder to reinvest the proceeds. This reduces your exposure to the overvalued markets at the same time as they are at their riskiest. So by simply making smart investment decisions and not chasing returns you should have no need to time the markets.",

* Initiated FSR with buy, PT of $31, saying the company’s key competitive advantages are interesting product and its platform-sharing and contract-manufacturing agreements
* Initiated RIDE with neutral PT $13; sees RIDE’s underlying technology as less of a differentiating factor versus competitors, although its niche target market of trucks/vans/SUVs for fleet customers is logical

The world’s largest carmaker previewed its “bZ4X,” an electric SUV sitting on its new “e-TNGA” platform

 at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show on Monday. The vehicle is a compact SUV that resembles Toyota’s popular Rav-4, but is built on a entirely new platform and features a distinctive yoke instead of a traditional steering wheel, as well as a system that can recharge the car’s battery using solar power.

By 2025 Toyota plans to introduce 15 EVs, including seven “bZ” series models globally, said Toyota Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda, speaking at a briefing Monday. The bZ4X is the first of the “bZ” series, which stands for “beyond zero,” or cars that exceed being “just zero-emission,” according to Toyota. Toyota plans to produce the bZ4X in Japan and China and sell it worldwide by mid-2022.

I have stumbled on Common Sense Investing somewhat recently and most times, he's talked about using the Fama French 3 or 5 factor model in investing. The factors are: Value over Growth, Small over Large, High over low profitability, Conservative over aggressive firms, and Investment. 
In his video, Ben Felix seems to promote an allocation of 6 ETFs(XIC 30%, VUN 30%, AVUV 10%, Xef 16%, ADVD 6%, XEC 8%), but says that it captures the Fama French model in a broad sense.

musw3k,gv7n3fz,stocks,comment,1618932724,"Not really, the basis of Fama French is that you have to diversify away all non-systemic risk. That means that doing research on individual companies is pretty much pointless since you'll have to end up with something similar to those index funds in the end, might as well just buy the index funds.

If you were to target a specific, or some complementary group of risk factors (small and value for example) you could do a bit more research and maybe do ok but there are index funds for those as well that will probably do better. FISVX for small and value for example",

Long-term options start behaving more like stocks the longer the duration, and the deeper in-the-money you go the less leverage is associated with the position and the lower the time-value cost of the position.

By buying calls on undervalued stocks and puts on overvalued stocks you end up profiting on the calls in a bull market, and on the puts in a bear market. Conversely, you lose on the puts in a bull market, and on the calls in a bear market. This essentially cancels out any influence the overall market has on your portfolio returns.

What you're left with is industry risk and company risk. So if you're calls generate more profit in a bull market than you lose on your puts, you turn a net profit. And if you're puts generate more profit in a bear market than you lose on your calls, you turn a net profit.

What do you do?Whether you choose to believe all the rumors circulating around that there's too much liquidity in the market, it's all a bubble, and a '08 style crash is near or not, let's imagine a hypothetical scenario in which you *do* believe that a market crash is likely to happen within a year. Let's also assume that the question applies to multiple different demographics:

1. You're a student, with not much of any assets to your name. You therefore don't have much leeway in terms of ""investing"" money, apart from perhaps a couple hundred bucks. However, you should be released onto the job market soon.
2. You're a family man(or woman), with a seemingly stable job. Perhaps you're renting, perhaps you own your family's apartment - In either case, you do have *some* savings, but have not yet invested much or any of them, for whatever reason - Perhaps they're meant for your kids' studies, and you're risk averse.
3. You're doing quite well for yourself, and have some assets invested in the stock market. While not providing a full wage's worth, the returns do permit you to finance your yearly or biyearly vacation.

The question now simply becomes: **In each scenario, what do you guys think the person in question should do to best hedge for themselves, under the belief of a coming crash? This question applies both to financials (Invest? In what?) as well as behavior (Get a different type of job?).**

For context, I personally don't believe that any imminent crash would have ripple effects of similar extent as '08, in part due to the regulation enacted post-crisis (Such as Dodd-Frank). However, any crash would be likely to at the very least exhibit similar short-term effects at the very least.

Although it does not matter much to the question, I believe that I do owe you some further context in regards to my ""own financial situation"", which should perhaps explain what motivated me to post this (Even though, again, this should not impact the question nor the answer): While I am one of those people hated on this sub for being fully invested both financially and emotionally in GameStop, my dad is not. He has *some* liquid money on the bank (No insane amounts, but an alright safety net. Although the definition of alright would probably depend on the person, and given the demographic frequenting this sub, my dad's amount is most likely on the lower end of your ""alright"" definition), owns his primary residence, and doesn't really have much of any other asset, whether stocks or something else.

Would be great to crowdsource some thoughts as I never view my investment theses as impenetrable. Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company’s [S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788), website, [latest Q1 2021 report](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788), and [Meritech’s breakdown of Coinbase’s S-1.](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading)

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",

I wanted to see what people thought of whitbread PLC? for those who don’t know it’s based in the Uk and is most commonly known for owning premier inn and beefeater.

My thoughts are that this might be a good play this summer, with another year of the uk population travailing around the UK more than going abroad. 
I also believe beefeater and premier inn to be relatively low cost / mid quality. Which I think is a combination that will be attractive to many tourists and uk holiday goers, who may be trying to save.

Costa also was under Whitbread, before being sold to Coca Cola for 3.9 billion in 2019. I used to work at a costa, so I have a slight confirmation bias to whitbread, which is annoying. I really wish they still had them lol. 

This stock doesn’t have much of a social media discussion. So I am Interested if anyone if familiar with it, and if so please let’s have a constructive discussion. 


I guess a kinda recovery play, but more specially chosen from trying to identify potential consumer behaviours or intentions.

Everyone has their own style, whether it be focusing on growth stocks, going for dividends, focusing on a sector, or whatever. Your investing style may not be optimal but it is what **you are comfortable with.**

The reason I am saying this is because I read soooo many people ask if this is the top, or that we are at all-time highs or they want to sell because they are worried or they are down 10%. **If you are asking these questions, then maybe you are not investing according to your own investing strategy.** Maybe you are invested too heavily in stocks which is why you are worried about a 10% correction or maybe you are invested in too many small-cap stocks. You could also be worried because you need money in one year and you thought the stock market was an easy place to make money.

Whatever your reason for doubting your decisions, there has to be a reason why you are doubting your investment decisions and that's because it does to conform to your investing strategy anymore. **Each time you ask yourself these questions or get worried, reflect on what your investment strategy is.**

I think this is a really important distinction. We all want to get the most returns we can, but that means investing in your style.

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversialtracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of  major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.

Reuters reported a spokesman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email its involvement with the new league which has been set up as a rival to Uefa's Champions League and includes clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United.

look at the year-by-year data going back to inception, or as long as possible. there are stretches when growth stocks are on a wining streak, other times when they under-perform the broader market or value stocks. some investors will bail out at the first sign of trouble or underperformance, relatively few will ride it out during a rough patch.

So let's take snowflake as an example. But there are many others with just as lofty valuations that we could use as an example. 

Now for the easiest way to ask this question:

When a valuation (market cap) seems high it’s because the market expects future profit/cash flow of the company to grow thus making the current valuation seem fair.  Obviously not everyone agrees with a current valuation so some people are buying, selling, long or short at any one time. So yes earnings have to grow and it doesn’t always happen thus stocks tank.",
mu95js,gv4eddb,stocks,comment,1618863020,"Its all speculative based on what sector its in and what potential growth is expected. Watch some YouTube videos about valuation. And if a 10% rise saw a $3 billion growth in market cap the next 10% would be more. Its to do with how many shares are outstanding.

Edit: so if company A has 1,000,000 shares at $1 each that a market cap of $1,000,000. 
Company B has 10,000 shares at $100 each thats the same market cap.
Company A goes up $1 it has doubled its market cap, company B goes up $1 and its now worth $1,010,000",
mu95js,gv4esnm,stocks,comment,1618863207,If they build something new or create more value for customers they get more valuable as a company. And when they get more valuable then their stock price usually rises in relation to that new value that they create. If Duke energy for example opens a new plant and it creates $10 million of value for customers the market cap should go up around $10 million too.

&#x200B;

Not really, honesty. Marketcap is just outstanding shares multiplied by the share price.

To explain it: Snowflake currently has 288.7 million outstanding shares. Their price currently sits at around 229 dollar, which gives them a marketcap of around 66 billion (288.700.000 X stock price of 229$). If a share would be worth 10% as much, it'd be trading at 252$, which would but them at a marketcap of 72$ billion. 

Obviously the biggest tell is indeed a company their earnings. The reason why snowflake (and some other company) have such a high valuation is because they show good YoY growth and they are active in an industry that has high margins.",

**Company states that they expect Q2 to be even better.**

We've seen a rise in various steel and iron ore prices only precedented in recent history by that which was seen in 2007-2010 ([https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-futures-streaming-chart](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-futures-streaming-chart)).

\- It seems that these companies are again directly benefiting from the favorable conditions in the commodity markets.

Outlook:

>We remain confident that market conditions are in place to benefit the domestic steel industry in 2021 and beyond,"" said Millett. ""While global economies are still recovering from the shock of COVID-19, we are seeing strong steel demand coupled with extremely low customer steel inventory throughout the supply chain. The automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery, despite the electronic chip shortage, and the construction, equipment and transportation sectors are also strong. Our order entry continues to be robust across our businesses, and when coupled with historically low inventories, supports continued strong steel selling values.  
We believe this momentum will continue throughout the year and that ***our second quarter 2021 earnings will be even higher than our record first quarter 2021 results.***  
We also believe U.S. trade policies and existing steel trade cases will continue to moderate steel imports. Based on strong domestic steel fundamentals and customer optimism, we continue to be confident regarding North American steel market dynamics. This positive environment coupled with our strategic growth initiatives provide firm drivers for our further growth in the coming years.

First, how many stocks/ETFs do you personally invest into it? I currently own some SPY and VTI that I was planning on putting that into there, and keeping my individual stocks in the regular market. I didn't think this was a thing, but I heard that you can take money out of your Roth IRA that you made from stocks without as big of a penalty, but that seems sort of redundant to the point, so I don't see how that could be true. Is there any other info you guys can give about investing in a Roth IRA? Like things you've learned, best way to go about doing this? etc. Thanks!",
muk27t,gv6aevm,stocks,comment,1618899682,"I'm with Fidelity and invested currently at 70% FZROX and 30% FZILX. Will likely add small cap exposure next year (I'm already maxed out the $6k contribution this year).

Best advise would be to not withdraw anything from your IRA. Let compound interest work for you long term. But there is no penalty to withdraw your contributed amount. There is a penalty if you withdraw earnings (i.e. it's a 10% early penalty plus income tax rate).

Big downside is if you withdraw from your Roth IRA, you cannot contribute backwards such as going back to 2020 if current year is 2021. This will make you miss out on years of compound growth.",

muk27t,gv6wjqj,stocks,comment,1618919511,"The Roth IRA and 401(k) are powerful wealth building tools sir, that can assist you in building your wealth over time. I understand we are living in a time where you are flooded with misinformation and you see any and everybody bragging about ridiculous returns from their investments. 
Maybe you might be able to as well, but there is no strategy to do that. As such, no professional will give you such an advice. 
I’m a licensed tax professional and this is financial advice. As much as possible, try to resist the urge to participate in the madness of the crowd with money you are putting into your 401(k) and IRA. In 2021, you are able to contribute $19,500 in a 401(k) plan (assuming your source of income is earned through an employer) and another $6000 to an IRA. At least, be extra careful with that $25,500 you earn each year because you know more than anyone the time and effort you put to earn that money. Invest that $25,500 in a Total US stock market Index fund and maybe a Total International Index Fund if you want exposure to businesses outside the United States.
After that, do whatever you need to do to make some extra income and see if you’re lucky enough to make some Yolo bets or pick some winning stocks and make ridiculous returns, so we can all be jealous of you 😂😉

(The questions you asked about IRA withdrawals and buying individual stocks are questions you will get answers to if you are serious about it and wish to learn. Maybe it will be beneficial to hire a financial advisor and the cost is justified if it prevents you from making costly mistakes. Good luck to you, I wish you the very best in all your endeavors!)",

I was interested in this stock before IPO but (thankfully) took a break from monitoring and investing in the market for a few months . I dodged a bullet by not jumping in at initial public offering.

I've started monitoring it a few weeks ago and I'm surprised to see it's still taking a bit of a dive despite only good news coming out for the company - partnering with VRBO, being listed as the biggest ""buy now, pay later"" company on the market. It also seems to be listed as a ""buy"" by every site I see.

1. I am familiar with the stock market basic things ( Stock buy low sell high)
2. Familiar with setting alerts so that I buy stock when price falls to certain price.
3. Looking   for long term investment (> 3Y). I fill up my 401k every year..and   75% of that is in Vanguard 500. So I am invested passively anyway.
4. The   rest of my savings, I would rather make it generate some income for me   than lie in a bank. I thought of saving for a house but I think that  is  too far ahead in the future now.
5. I am looking to invest in VOO, VOOV, VOOG, VTI as the stable ones. Was recommended PAVE, ARKK and SOXX. Any suggestions?
6. I do not want to time the market. I know the market is insanely high now. I will invest fixed amount (300$/ mo) for now.

Two questions -

1. What   is someone shares me a python script that I can use to download the   complete information of all these ETFs, and then I create my own   personal portfolio by buying individual stocks?? Will that be good??   Again - I will not be actively tracking as I am in for long.

2) supposedly investing money lump term outperforms dollar cost average (dca) 2/3 of the time, but I prefer to dca anyway.  If it goes up, you're happy because you have a piece. If it goes down, you're happy because you got to buy more for cheaper.

3) I don't know PAVE and SOXX but ARKK is pretty high risk.  I wouldn't put it in the same category as VTI, but in the same bucket as any individual stock.

mutq93,,investing,post,1618934752,"Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's handNew York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

Company states that they expect Q2 to be even better.

We've seen a rise in various steel and iron ore prices only precedented in recent history by that which was seen in 2007-2010 ([https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-futures-streaming-chart](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-futures-streaming-chart)). At that time, Steel and Iron Ore companies recorded record profits, and many traded to their all-time-highs. With that, I've been monitoring the performance of the metals leaders in the U.S. and around the world:

\- It seems that these companies are again directly benefiting from the favorable conditions in the commodity markets.

Outlook:

>We remain confident that market conditions are in place to benefit the domestic steel industry in 2021 and beyond,"" said Millett. ""While global economies are still recovering from the shock of COVID-19, we are seeing strong steel demand coupled with extremely low customer steel inventory throughout the supply chain. The automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery, despite the electronic chip shortage, and the construction, equipment and transportation sectors are also strong. Our order entry continues to be robust across our businesses, and when coupled with historically low inventories, supports continued strong steel selling values.   
>  
>We believe this momentum will continue throughout the year and that ***our second quarter 2021 earnings will be even higher than our record first quarter 2021 results.***   
>  
>We also believe U.S. trade policies and existing steel trade cases will continue to moderate steel imports. Based on strong domestic steel fundamentals and customer optimism, we continue to be confident regarding North American steel market dynamics. This positive environment coupled with our strategic growth initiatives provide firm drivers for our further growth in the coming years.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/) included qualitative thoughts. Part 2 includes my quantitative thoughts. Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company’s [S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788), website, [latest Q1 2021 report](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788), and [Meritech’s breakdown of Coinbase’s S-1.](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading)

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",

One question is how the stock will contend with the approval of a BTC ETF, if this occurs.   Right now, many COIN buyers want exposure to the crypto sector, but with the investor protections of a publicly traded equity.  A natural place for it is in a Roth IRA.   But, if a BTC ETF is approved (and that's a big if) wouldn't you rather have that instead?

An attractive feature of COIN's ""we sell shovels in this gold rush"" investment thesis is that buying it means you don't have to pick a winner in the crypto boom.  If BTC ends up #1, you make money, but you also make money if it's ETH, or if it's one of the touted Ethereum killers (if a coin they don't have like Solana really takes off, they will add it).

Maybe someone will find it usefull and i will find some new information here.  Also English its not my native language, sorry in advance for some mistakes. 

  
SPAR Group is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more. Its from their 10K.  


I screen stocks for their fundamentals and then, if i see something interesting there, iam going deeper.

**Lets see their multiples first:**

\- P/E 10,4x

\- P/B 1,1x

\- ROIC 26%

\- Net debt (- 2,7 mln $) ( they have more cash in their balance than debt).

\- Total debt/ CFO( cash flow from operations) = 1,5x. 

They have really good fundamentals and strong balance sheet. Also positive FCFF ( free cash flow to the firm).  

Their revenue  for 2020 was 230,5 mln $( 252,8 mln $ in 2019, - 9% YOY Growth). It consist of two majore sources. Revenue in United states was 92,1 mln $, International revenue 138,4 mln $.

  


| Net international revenue: | **2020** | YOY Growth |2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brazil| **49,940**|\-24%| 65,942|
|South Africa | **28,235** |4%| 27,201 |
|Mexico | **22,679**|\-3%| 23,324|
|China | **12,401** |\-5%| 12,993 |
|Japan | **9,273**|\-19%| 11,469 |
|India | **8,589**  |\-3%| 8,813   |
|Canada | **6,294** |\-31%| 9,059  |
|Australia | **988**  |\-68%| 3,087|
|Turkey|**-**|\-100%| 268  |
|Total international revenue|**138,399 (59,9% of revenue)**|\-15%| 162,156  (64,1% of revenue)|

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what.",

mtjvlt,,investing,post,1618774981,"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

mt2tfk,,investing,post,1618706696,"Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense InvestingI wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often.",['SPGI']

msaeih,,investing,post,1618600826,"Next week, the US cannabis industry is nearing its first major federal legislation milestone of the year. SAFE Act[**Marijuana Banking Bill Expected To Get A House Floor Vote Next Week, Sponsor’s Office Says**](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-banking-bill-expected-to-get-a-house-floor-vote-next-week-sponsors-office-says/)

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",['ED']

msaeih,gusgny2,investing,comment,1618620995,"I'm heavy in US Cannabis and my heaviest position is in Cresco. Just want to drop a little fundamental analysis here for you guys and expand on SAFE further. 

Bullish Arguments First: 

Currently, the Big 4 MSO's that you mentioned above are trading at a P/S ratio of near or about 7. Meaning their market caps are about 7x their 2020 Revenues. Cresco, specifically, is 6.88 P/S. To compare, CGC and APHA have a P/S of 26 and 9, respectively. MNST is a Consumer Packaged Good [CPG] that trades at about 11 P/S, although that's not a perfect comparison. I consider Cannabis a mix between Agriculture and CPG, so I chose MNST for a comparison with a more mature growth company. Now, a P/S near 7 isn't that crazy of a discount, since that's what more mature growth companies are trading near. However, that's not considering the exponential growth that each state brings in terms of sales. Each state has a TAM boost of maybe near 1-2 Billion. Each MSO had Year over Year growths of over 100% in sales. And the estimates for 2021 and 2022 remain over 100%. For example, Cresco has a 2022 estimated P/S of **2.5**. Meaning the stock price should 3-4 x to catch up to the 2022 P/S expectation. The estimates are fairly conservative, because they don't consider that the MSO's could potentially reach scale in NJ, NY, and other states that just legalized recreational cannabis. They also aren't fully considering the acquisitions being made and how they could boost revenues and the increased demand in states like Illinois (Did you see those sales numbers?! March had the highest sales OF ALL TIME). 

Talking about acquisitions, it helps lead me into my next point. The MSO's have been incredibly successful, but they've essentially had one arm tied behind their backs. They are forced to trade in Canadian markets and over the counter so their equity raises for acquisitions are heavily handicapped. They are also taxed heavy because Cannabis is linked to Section 280E. Not to mention, they don't even have access to banking yet, which is what SAFE will help with. Literally, they have cash block rooms for the IRS to collect taxes. There are a fair amount of headwinds they are running into, but they are still growing an incredible amount; not to mention that all the Big 4 are already generating positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of the Section 280 and federal handicaps they run up against.  None of the big Canadian players are generating positive EBITDA yet, for comparison, and they don't have to worry about the same federal headwinds. The problem, in my opinion, with the Canadians is Canada is one country, with population roughly equal to CA or TX, but with the entire US's worth of competition; there's also no limit on supply of Cannabis. Basic supply and demand, but more supply, less pricing power and lower the margins. The US limits licenses for legalized states so supply is topped. Illinois has the best blueprint, in my opinion, and they are being called the Silicon Valley of Weed. Just SAFE passing and getting off of [280E](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-irs-tries-to-collect-taxes-from-marijuana-companies-through-280e/) will create a massive earnings gap fill (earnings will legit near double). 

[Now what does SAFE do for us?](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/would-safe-banking-allow-msos-to-uplist-onto-major-u-s-exchanges-the-experts-weigh-in/) We already know it will pass House next week. We just need the 10 votes in Senate. There are a lot of different viewpoints on SAFE, but the most bullish is if it can help sway the US exchanges to allow for uplisting. Uplisting is the #1 catalyst we should look out for. This opens the door for institutions, ETF's, other fundies, even robinhooders to buy the stock. Right now I think most of them are buying the Canadians instead, which don't have real growth prospects in the US. They can't enter the US THC market and remain listed because it's illegal federally. So while they are doing their thing in Canada, the US MSO's are growing and scaling in key states. When it's federally legal, Canadians might try to enter, but they won't have the time or the equity to scale and compete. It sucks because they had to learn all the lessons the hard way, and now, the US names learned from their mistakes AND they get to keep the Canadians out while they grow and reach scale. It's actually quite fortunate for them the way it worked out. If Cannabis was legalized federally too quickly, the Canadians could have just used their sheer market cap to bully and acquire the US MSO's. 

I can go on all night, but I've spent a fair amount of time writing this up already. Let's briefly discuss the bearish viewpoints.

1) Congress. They could hold up legislation for Cannabis. Although SAFE is one that we should expect in 2021, decriminalization and federal legalization will take time. SAFE doesn't guarantee uplisting, but helps the % chance it can happen in 2021. Today there was news of a federal Bill that allows Veterans to carry legal medical Cannabis across illegal state lines. That's a pretty good start, if it can pass. 

2) Margin compressions. As the market for US Cannabis matures, companies will experience margin compression. Especially as more licenses are distributed. This probably doesn't happen for many years or until growth stales. 

3) ??? I'm sure there are more.

For exposure that better matches GDP hold 1.37x VWO for every VTMy portfolio exclusively consists of Vanguard Total World Stock ETFs (VT and VWRL). I specifically invest in those because they give exposure to the world, instead of ETFs with a focus on the US, like VTI and VOO.

Or so I thought...

[VT has a market allocation of 57.1% to US and only 4.5% to China.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vt)

[In contrast, US makes up 24.2% of GDP and China 17.8%.](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/April/weo-report?c=512,914,612,614,311,213,911,314,193,122,912,313,419,513,316,913,124,339,638,514,218,963,616,223,516,918,748,618,624,522,622,156,626,628,228,924,233,632,636,634,238,662,960,423,935,128,611,321,243,248,469,253,642,643,939,734,644,819,172,132,646,648,915,134,652,174,328,258,656,654,336,263,268,532,944,176,534,536,429,433,178,436,136,343,158,439,916,664,826,542,967,443,917,544,941,446,666,668,672,946,137,546,674,676,548,556,678,181,867,682,684,273,868,921,948,943,686,688,518,728,836,558,138,196,278,692,694,962,142,449,564,565,283,853,288,293,566,964,182,359,453,968,922,714,862,135,716,456,722,942,718,724,576,936,961,813,726,199,733,184,524,361,362,364,732,366,144,146,463,528,923,738,578,537,742,866,369,744,186,925,869,746,926,466,112,111,298,927,846,299,582,487,474,754,698,&s=NGDPD,&sy=2019&ey=2021&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1)

[To adjust for this you can buy an ETF with a focus on China, e.g. VWO.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo)

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

[Sources and calculation can be found in this sheet.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5yv6O6-S6IHhiGF0OAySZ6_WTO1SL1U/view)

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this). If you then want to take the additional step of being overweight China equities broadly, something like VWO doesn't sound crazy.  And that step is an interesting debatable topic.",

I was thinking how in 2018 everyone was pessimistic about markets because equities were very expensive (by 2018 standards) and companies were loaded with debt. Also growth was slowing down and major companies were reporting lower earnings. Hard to believe but people were worried about Apple as it was selling less iPhones year over year. I remember we had quite a big crash in 2018 but then China saved us. Literally China saved out butts and prevented recession. Then things went as they did afterwards people were again complaining about how equities were very expensive and growth was slowing. There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that.

&#x200B;

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

msadak,,investing,post,1618600726,"AST Spacemobile ($ASTS), Lynk, and Apple all will be competing for the lucrative $40B mobile to satellite marketFull disclosure: I have a small position in $ASTS and warrant $ASTSW. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to share some info on $ASTS (AST Spacemobile) to save potential retail investors time when they do their DD. There is this idea of ""20-100x Return Or 100% Loss"" associated with $ASTS floating around, but AST Spacemobile is no $NKLA. The technology was proven to work by AST and again by Lynk. Apple is diving in this as well. AST Spacemobile the real deal with over 1000 patents, extensive satellite expertise particularly their CEO, and their own majority owned satellite subsidiarity Nanoavionics and is already cash flow positive. AST Spacemobile itself has no debt.

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

[Article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200318005113/en/Lynk-First-to-Connect-Satellite-Directly-to-Standard-Mobile-Phones-on-Earth)

&#x200B;

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['MS', 'AAPL', 'DISH', 'AMT', 'TWTR']"

This comes on the heels of excellent bank earnings for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. thanks to record liquidity and savings.

Record revenue and earnings are likely products of a busy year of acquisitions in 2020, which included the purchase of e*trade and Eaton Vance.

As a part of a larger trend, MS looks to be undergoing a transformation, achieving most of their revenues through trading, asset/wealth management, and fees and commissions rather than investment banking and interest revenues.

mrhrgv,,investing,post,1618502557,"Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

mru1gk,,investing,post,1618540606,"There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock marketHedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['TSLA', 'DE']"

ABML is close to establishing their pilot plant but they already have a closed loop system that extracts 99%+ of materials.

mrow7p,gunvqlb,investing,comment,1618528650,"Keep in mind this is highly anecdotal because it's just my opinion as a pharma chemist for over 10 years now, I've worked for a couple start-ups, a couple global top 5 corporations, and a few others like generics.

I don't think the problem is our production capabilities. It's really not too difficult for me to find a job, even in a lot of rural areas. If the government really wanted to they could use the defense production act to pump out assloads of covid vaccines. The problem lies in how the industry works these days.

The big boys - Pfizer, Merck, Bayer... - don't really do much true R&D anymore, it's a better business model for them to let the small fries do that and then just buy them. They have production capabilities but they're relatively limited because they're focused on high volume of specific formulations. As far as markets go, this is the glamorous biotech/pharma wealth and risk everyone is familiar with.

But there's a middle group too, and it's huge. There are thousands of mid-sized pharma companies that usually produce either generics or less profitable out-of-patent pharmaceuticals that are anything but glamorous. This is where America's production ability lies, but the problems with tapping it all stem from the corporate... ecosystem, I guess.

The big boys have the most cutting edge patents (and if they don't they buy them, like Pfizer did with BioNTech), so getting them to share with a handful or more mid-sized companies is difficult. But if you manage that the next issue arises in the meeting of two very different worlds; big pharma and still-tiny-but-not-startup-tiny pharma. It's been going very smoothly so far though, the only problem we've seen was with the Baltimore company making J&J's vaccine.

So to try and relate this to the stock market..... I guess Biden could incentivize big pharma to share important patents with mid-sized companies? Invest in Regeneron?

Maybe there's an etf that focuses on not just mid cap, but mid-range production (volume) companies but other than that I don't see a greater than average profit without getting lucky on a stock.","['PFE', 'MRK', 'UPS']"

mrmmk1,,investing,post,1618516360,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world. 

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

mrmmk1,gun9r67,investing,comment,1618518345,"Thanks for your detailed analysis of this company. I am on the other side of your trade and appreciate a good opposition. 

I think you are oversimplifying the demand component of this business. The managed care business was destroyed last year but the occupancy numbers are slowly ticking back up and will be back to normalized levels by next year. People don’t go to these facilities because they want to so the real issue was the quarantine and the lack of normal demand in the system. 

On the financial side of the equation, I think your operating revenue assumptions are also off. They got rid of the worst properties last year and most of the debt that you highlighted is long-term mortgage debt on the real estate. 

I am absolutely aware that they have some work to do but at an $85m market cap today they are easily worth 5x if they can get back on track. This is not guaranteed for sure but a great risk reward from the current price.

I didn't think it looked like a turnaround was coming up soon and passed it by.+ having a ridiculous rally recently doesn't mean anything on its own for any stock. It just got back to it's pre-crash levels. Since it was headed down pre-crash, maybe that does make for a good short entry, but I'd still thinking of it has having come DOWN to the low 40s.- I think your thesis about the loss of old folks is unlikely to hold up. Sure, we lost a bunch of them, but there were already too many.  People are on waiting lists for years, even decades, to get into senior housing. And, we all know that housing in general has a serious supply problem that isn't going away soon.- I guess I'd say compare its fundamentals to peers and base things on that, but also no reason to start a short against short-term momentum either, so now doesn't seem like the time.",

* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well.","['TSLA', 'AAPL', 'PYPL']"

mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrepwx,guny7b8,investing,comment,1618529894,"I think DISCA might be or in the near future be undervalued due to the dump and shorts. If you're willing to hold out then it could make you some money assuming it progresses normally.

My problem with DISCA lies in a few issues:

1. I think streaming will keep growing, but likely to see downturn post-covid.

2. Restriction of content and no benefit from reopening due to it lacking a movie studio or movie production line. T has Warner. NFLX is buying up studios left and right and recently started winning awards. VIAC has Paramount. Amazon has it's in house studio and can literally buy a studio if it wanted. 

3. It would be incorrect to assume that DISCA's previous highs are a guarantee of future highs or even return to those highs. It (along with VIAC) was runned up and pump by Archegos.

4. DISCA doesn't have other business arms to keep it fighting if the streaming war continues into a battle of attrition or if a sudden price-cutting war breaks out. T brings in tons of money from mobile, internet/phone lines, trad TV, and WarnerMedia that does movies. AMZN is a company that will be around for 100 years and it's making money on everything. NFLX is the incumbent and investors gives it the benefit of the doubt as a tech company and will keep buying even if it loses money every year (unlike DISCA). VIAC has a movie studio and a host of news outlets. DIS has a multiple media empire, MCU owns the movies, has theme parks, owns HULU, and sells toys to kids. Alphabet's youtube is already cash positive and will never go away. Comcast is like T and does telecommunications, movies, and news.

5. All these companies can package their stuff with other things. I get HBOMax free with my internet from T. I've been getting NFLX for $2/month with my T-mobile plan for years now. NFLX is the most popular subscription packaged with other subscriptions that people already use. AMEX Gold and higher cards get it for free. DIS+ is the 2nd most population ""added"" free subscription. AMZN gives it's streaming free as a bonus to prime shipping membership. Comcast gives it's for free with it's telecom offerings. ***What does DISCA package it's streaming with so that it's FREE?***

6. Average number of streaming services a person/family will have is 1-3. Very few will go past 4 or even 5. Now think about where DISCA will fit when [DIS, NFLX, and AMZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_services) are there locking up the top 3. Youtube is always free with streaming as a plus. It's left to fight for the scraps among Hulu, HBOMax, Peacock, Viacom, and AppleTV & other lesser rivals.

7. Content. I don't think Discovery even has the advantage on content. [NFLX/DIS/T/VIAC all beat it in content.](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/ranking-best-original-content-streaming)

8. Moat. There's no moat in the industry. If there was one then it's NFLX's name and the ability to package other services which I mentioned in 5. We're already oversaturated BEFORE factoring new entrants both in the states, Europe, and China.

I won't tell you to NOT buy DISCA. I just think it's a small fish in a crowded and ever-tightening pool of sharks. I've been in GOOG and T for years. The only reason I don't sell T is because I'm just pocketing dividends of the TELECOM company I bought. Not for the streaming. If I were to do some pickup I'd take VIAC over DISCA. 

I am also interested on your opinion on my assessment.","['DIS', 'NFLX', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'DISCA', 'VIAC', 'CMCSA']"

Looking forward to reading the reports of the other financial institutions reporting today and later this week. Other than the permabears, the news on the economic recovery has been seemingly unanimously good. I think that well-capitalized banks, lowered reserve ratios, and the recent fiscal policy on infrastructure/modernization spending (e.g., digital health, climate change, science and technology research) all point towards more lending/financing of growth areas.

If Coinbase opens with a similar percentage increase, the price would be around $343, very close to the average private market price in the first quarter of $343.58.""

Related party transactions and acquisitions have been a matter of habit for the Alibaba Partnership. In April 2014, Alibaba gave Simon Xie a $1 billion loan which he used to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media5 through an entity that was jointly owned by Jack Ma and Simon Xie. Alibaba claimed that they were not able to invest in Wasu Media directly because of Chinese regulations and that investing through Mr. Xie’s entity was the only way. In fact, Alibaba has regularly invested alongside Yunfeng Capital, a Shanghai based private equity company that was established by Jack Ma in 2010. The list of such related party transactions runs long and as recently as 2019 Alibaba Pictures gave a $103 million loan to struggling film studio Huayi Brothers Media in which Jack Ma has a considerable stake6. The lines between Alibaba’s shareholder interests and Jack Ma’s personal interests are very blurry, and at odds with our philosophy of backing clean and well aligned ownership structures.

Since Alibaba’s IPO, the asset base has grown tenfold from $18 billion to $185 billion or 48% per year.

However, this asset growth has mostly been driven by acquisitions and self-reported asset revaluations. Between 2014 and 2020, Alibaba has expanded their balance sheet by $92 billion in relation to equity investments (incl. goodwill recognised). In the same period, the ROAs have dropped from 26% to 13% and ROIC has fallen from 33% to 8%.

Alibaba management justifies these acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015, Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197. Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after four years in the red8.

Some of these acquisitions are in fact so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project10.",

Go to hour 9 minute 30 for his spiel as all the information is pulled from his testimony. Ticker is CRK .

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

Going to buy options around Q1 earnings date (May 4th, 2021). May the Fourth be with us research monkeys! :)",['NI']

Maybe they will faciliate some tasks for companies without good sized or skilled IT teams, I dont' know...

Their  UI seems very interesting and well designed, I can give that. But I m  sure we will be quicker with a simple linux terminal (joke) :)

If  I need to think about a road : they maybe will be a 3d engine like  Unreal Engine or Unity but for data linking, preparation, and IA models  (the tool that groups up the techs in a simpler way).. but I have a  doubt.

Just a single (and possibly uninformed) perspective, but that has not been my experience working at a f100 financial services firm. We have multiple complex proprietary processing systems that we've spent tens of millions on, multiple large-scale data warehouse (each with thousands if not tens of thousands of tables), and a whole supporting cast of upstream, intermediate, and reporting systems. These systems are diverse, some proprietary, some purchased, and they have been stood up over decades. It takes our IT group many months to create or even modify integration between legacy systems. We have a small army of IT folks and have thrown an awful lot of cash at several top-tier consulting groups and none have had a magic bullet. Every RFP response promises nirvana, and all scale expectations once they open the hood understand the scale of our data issues.   

If these guys have a way to efficiently unify/link and homogenize diverse datasets, it is a very big deal and worth alot of money. Especially if they have found a way to structure unstructured data effectively, as they claim.

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US)’s first product unveiling of 2021 will take place on April 20, the company said on Tuesday.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant dubbed the event “Spring Loaded” in a media invitation. Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business.","['AAPL', 'FB', 'TWTR']"

PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a  unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and  offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential  legalization of iGaming in the United States.""

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections and factoring in debt and dilution.
2. From  published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,  bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.  Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to  fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected  10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

Recent signals of Blackstone/CVC’s long-term hold beyond lockup expiration:

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler : “We believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

SEC filed FTAC’s Board of  Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward.”

&#x200B;

Edit:  Looking at the bear case to justify recent price action but it becomes very hard to do when Paysafe has substantially positive free cash flow at $362 million, healthy revenue growth, and strong EBITDA growth.

Even looking at a basket of the poorest performing fintechs with much slower revenue growth or even negative revenue growth, negative EBITDA and negative cash flow, the lowest possible average of that basket of multiples would put Paysafe’s share price at $15.43. There is no reasonable way to argue that Paysafe is worth even that little.

For example:

Paysign has negative revenue growth (-30.4%), negative EBITDA margin and  negative EBITDA growth, and yet it trades at a higher EV/REV multiple of 8.5X. This would put Paysafe 15% higher at $15.20.

Shift4 reported only 4.8% y-o-y rev growth, with negative  cash flow, negative EBITDA growth and much higher debt to equity but it  still trades at EV/REV of 10.6x. This puts Paysafe SP at $18.88.

Shift4's EV/EBITDA multiple of 51.56X would put Paysafe SP at $31.29.


Unlike most other fintech companies, Paysafe has very large exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, which have been very hard hit during Covid.  When we look at other brick-and-mortar payment processors like Visa and Mastercard, we can see that, during this time, Paysafe has performed extremely well by comparison:

-- Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

-- Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

The averaged EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors with negative revenue growth would put Paysafe’s share price at $25

Their EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $48




Another measure:
Fintech competitors with negative EPS:   Repay:  -0.67,  Affirm :  -2.18,  Nuvei : -1.08,   Paysign : -0.19.  Bill :  -0.62,  Shift4 : -0.43 
 
Average EV/EBITDA multiples of above would put Paysafe's SP at $69





Paysafe excluded expansion of US iGaming from its growth projections even though ”roughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe.""  Considering that an analyst with a $19 PT said, ""we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of  state-level legalization of iGaming,""  it would seem that an upgrade to growth guidance and price target is in the making.

mr23mr,,investing,post,1618440740,"My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?",['TSLA']

So I’ve been putting the bulk of my portfolio into safe SPY another other ETFs of the like. But I was reading about some equal weighted ETFs (RSP, EUSA, EWMC, EWSC) that have me thinking that I may be leaving potential growth on the table by not diversifying into them. I do know that the equal weighted ETFs tend to suffer more during big dips, so was researching different investment strategies about it. I’m not quite sure if it is the smartest choice to properly expose myself to the smaller stocks.

mr3c8y,gujsw6r,investing,comment,1618445334,"If the case for equal weighted funds is so that you have more small cap exposure because small cap outperforms large cap, then it becomes a discussion on factors - specifically the size factor.

If you want more risk-adjusted return, equal weighting doesn't give you adequate exposure to the size factor.

You need a small-cap fund that filters out small-cap growth stocks, because historically they actually have a negative total return. You want a small-cap value fund ideally.

If the case for equal weighting is that you don't like FAANG and think tech is overvalued/the next tech bubble is about to burst, well, if you hold VTI and VXUS you're diversified, and that's the best you can do fundamentally. Otherwise you are moving into the realm of investor ""tastes"", which also doesn't have a good risk-adjusted return rate.",

Equal weight ETFs need to be continuously re-balanced with market movements changing the weights of the individual stocks.  This means that you'll constantly be losing money to the Bid-Ask spread.  Additionally, the ETF manager will generally charge a higher fee as they have to do more work to constantly maintain the equal weighting.  

Overall, these are small but continuous losses that you're essentially paying to keep the position weighted equally.",

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

mqy9tn,,investing,post,1618429220,"Vicinity Motor Corp/Grande West Transportation TSXV: $VMC OTC: $BUSXD - Significantly undervalued with amazing growth opportunities ahead Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&t=454s&ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.
* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting
* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.
* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

>The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

It assumes that after the asset price doubling (from $11 to $22), the costs to mine the same quantity of bitcoin stays constant. This may be approximately true with gold. But with bitcoin, the difficulty of mining scales with the number of miners, which in turn scales with the price of the asset to maintain an equilibrium.

So in actuality, after the asset price doubling, it is much more likely to cost $20 to mine $22 worth of bitcoin. Profit margin stays the same as just buying and holding the asset.",

mq6e0u,guf9wli,investing,comment,1618353614,"So this is oversimplified to the point of probably being inflammatory, but here I go:

Firstly, our entire economy, not just the stock market, is predicated on the assumption that growth can and must continue infinitely. All credit and lending is based on the ideal that the supply of money will grow, allowing borrowers to pay off loans with interest and still come out ahead. The stock market's pyramid-ish tendencies are therefore not a risk unique to the stock market.

Secondly, it's my opinion that the U.S. government, and the corporations it is beholden to, are simply never going to let the stock market crash long-term if they can do anything at all to prevent it. That doesn't mean the bull market is infinite, but it means that on a long enough time horizon there are only two possible things that will follow a massive crash:

1) Investors who were properly diversified, and who have the time, cash buffer, and fortitude to hold and ride out the crash will eventually regain the value they lost (which was only ever lost on paper), and investors who have capital on hand to keep buying will make even more profit. 

2) The stock market never recovers, which can only mean the U.S. government as we know it has essentially collapsed, and at that point the fact that your portfolio is worth nothing is probably not your biggest concern.

Historically recessions facilitate more transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, because even though the wealthiest lose the most during a recession initially, the effect is temporary and they still have enough liquid capital on hand to buy up a bunch of assets at a discount from sellers who are hard pressed enough for short-term cash to sell at a loss. 

Bottom line, here's the secret to success: Diversify your investments, increase your cash allocation as you approach an age where you may not have the luxury of waiting for a recovery to play out, buy assets during recessions if you can, and hope that the government doesn't allow income inequality to get bad enough that the guillotines come out.",

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

mpmggo,,investing,post,1618258901,"Young people stand to make dismal returns on their investments — EconomistFrom Credit Suisse’s latest global investment returns yearbook, Generation Z’s earnings from stocks and bonds will be significantly lower than those of previous generations.

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/15/young-people-stand-to-make-dismal-returns-on-their-investments

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

mpyftu,guctimd,investing,comment,1618309593,"Hello. I would like to get an advice about investing as a Russian resident.

1. I'm 31 years old, live in Russia - which has an effect on whole situation.
2. I work as developer. My monthly income is about 1400$, but I hope it will increase as it has been increasing before.
3. My main short-term objective is to save money, and buy a bigger house/apartment after 5-6 years.
4. I have some individual stocks right now: 2 AAPL, 1 ENPH, 2 XOM, 1 MSFT, 1 NEE, 2 PLTR, 1 TSM, 2 UAL, 1 DIS.

&#x200B;

The whole situation with my country makes any saving in local currency a joke. Even housing is not worth. In fact, with my current stocks I'm down 1% in general, but up 4% in my local currency.

There are sanctions on horizon, any time my president could do any shit, which would worsen situation for all the folks. So, I've chosen investing in world (not local) companies.

As a Russian resident I can't easily get access to a foreign broker. So, I'm pretty limited in available stocks and ETFs. My current broker is one of the 3 major Russian banks.

&#x200B;

**ETF or individual stocks?**

Maybe I should buy some ETFs, but again, which ones? There are not so much available for me - most of them are ruled by Russian banks. And I'm afraid they could collapse after sanctions or some other shit.

The only one which is semi-international is FinEx: FXUS, FXDE, FXWO and so on.

With individual stocks I'm more confident, because I'm an shareholder and present in all the required registries. So, I could restore access to my shares if something happens.

The price is less profit compared to ETF and more time spent on tracking companies.

&#x200B;

My current plan is to buy individual stocks regularly. I would chose companies from S&P500 and add some less reliable like ENPH, PLTR.

Short term plan is to buy: little oil (XOM), some cruise (like Carnival), more green energy (NEE), add no-tech companies like Walmart, McDonald's, Procter&Gamble. Also I was thinking about LHA.

So, I would like to diversify, but be more tech.","['XOM', 'DIS', 'AAPL', 'MCD', 'NEE', 'ENPH', 'CCL', 'MSFT', 'UAL', 'WMT', 'SPGI']"
mpr7hk,,investing,post,1618273875,"Canoo Inc. (GOEV) Due Diligence  


**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Tony serves as executive chairman and founded Solera Holdings a successful company that provides risk management, asset protection software, services to the automotive industry and property insurance. He has also served as chairman for multiple other companies including Sportradar Group,Aircraft Performance Group,RocketRoute Limited, global aviation services company, and  APG Avionics LLC.

**Mark Aikman**

Mark Serves as Chief Marketing Officer and he has nearly 20 years of experience including a decade at Daimler AG.

## Ulrich Kranz

Ulrich currently serves as CEO, and has worked with the company since 2017 as the company's CTO (chief technical officer). Since 1986 Ulrich has been involved in the car business holding various leadership positions at BMW AG and caused great innovation.

**Peter Savagian**

Peter Serves as the current CTO and has held multiple different leadership positions at companies including  Ampaire, Inc, Electrified Future,Faraday&Future Inc,Sibros Technologies,and General Motors Company. Which are all companies that have to do with automobiles, electric vehicles, or technology closely related to those categories.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

[Canoo had another no revenue Quarter ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter)

My thoughts: I think that while the recent class action Lawsuit may cause some issues for the company Canoo has a unique product that could become popular, has enough cash to run the business for multiple years even if the release is delayed, and has good management that is in touch with the business Canoo is in.","['GM', 'DE']"

mpgnog,,investing,post,1618242555,"Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023. Mobileye is working with the startup Udelv to manufacture 35,000 delivery vehicles[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023)

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”",['INTC']

mprkx9,,investing,post,1618275211,"About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM ESTOn Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

We'll know Tuesday at 8:30 AM EST. It could be interesting.",
mprkx9,gucgqvb,investing,comment,1618296862,"I don't think it's clear what the market will do in either case.

Higher than expected -> buy because you'd rather hold assets? sell because you think the fed will ease off?

Lower than expected -> buy because you think the fed will continue to print? sell because cash isn't being devalued as everyone expects?

Investing is hard man",
mprkx9,gud62bb,investing,comment,1618318523,"It was up .6% in March. What worries me so much about this is the powers that be (Powell, etc...) keep saying that they expect inflation to pick up this year, but they are sure it will be ""transitory"" or a short term thing, then it will just go away. I realize I don't know nearly as much as them, but doesn't inflation have a psychological effect, that feeds on itself? When people see prices rising quickly they change their behavior, which causes prices to rise more, etc... 

Inflation is not easy to get under control, so why are people so confident that this time will be different?",
mpllls,,investing,post,1618256463,"In-depth DD on Bio Stock Nearing Approval of Breakthrough Drug to Treat Depression: Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) 

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

**Disclaimer**: I have 400 shares at an average cost basis of $51.96.","['MS', 'NDAQ', 'MRK', 'BLK', 'PFE', 'CAH', 'BIO']"

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

In the long-term, money will flow to those firms that increase their revenues and earnings (which ultimately are able to deliver the greatest amount of cash back to their shareholders). In the short-term you might see some volatility or discrepancies but in the long-term, money follows where money is being made.

This is part of the efficient market framework that people are  so quick to dismiss. Can Tesla or Gamestop continue to have high valuations? Sure...but if they don't start making that expected future cash via increasing earnings and revenues, the market will let Elon Musk and Ryan Cohen know pretty quick.

This is why people like me always recommend a globally-diversified, low-cost index fund like VT. Money will flow wherever the cash is been made. Sometimes it is in large-cap stocks, others in American stocks, and other times in technology stocks.

mohir3,,investing,post,1618104600,"Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s whyWhich is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

mohir3,gu41cxk,investing,comment,1618110477,"The previous 10 years have been the best time to invest in real estate. You can just look for an inflation corrected price index to see the dramatic appreciation in the last decade following (and probably directly resulting from) the 2008 housing value crash. I remember wishing I could buy like mad in 2011, though I was in school with no income. 

I'm not sure now that properties are very expensive and don't cash flow nearly as well (or, usually at all) you can expect the same safe and robust returns. 

Though owning your own home is probably a safe expense to have regardless. The equity building process can be almost like constantly putting money in a bank account pegged to inflation. 
I bet ownership just kind of feels nice too. Especially if you are settling down and no longer want to move around and experience new places.  Probably a very freeing experience to have something that is totally yours.",

mun7ti,,StockMarket,post,1618913794,"[Mining stocks Thread] Set me straight. What stock are r/stockmarket mining bulls currently looking at?With the exponential  rise of EV’s, we are all aware of how high mining stocks have become bullish in recent years in the likes of $BHP, $VALE, $FCX and $RIO. But with the rise of these huge mining stocks, other mining stocks with small market cap can’t be overlooked.  
Over the past few years, I have managed to make some good gains with these so-called small mining stocks through growth catalysts. Up to date, this is what I’m bullish on:  
[$STHC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/sthc/) \- Southcorp Capital Inc

* Had a huge reverse merger with Ameca Mining/Group looming. Awaiting 43-101 report (delayed due to Covid travel restrictions) to validate findings in eastern Sri Lanka prior to finalizing reverse merger. $4.4 billion in high grade graphite being the biggest finding. Off take agreements already setup. Graphite demand exploding with EV battery market’s exponential growth. Ground level entry here under $30 million market cap.  


[$LODE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comstock-releases-shareholder-letter-embarks-104500170.html) \- Comstock Mining Inc

* Was a bit frustrated when Spruce Point tried to short them forcing me to sell 50% of my holdings but probably we’ll see the stock rise again with the revival of Green shift.

[$SLSSF](https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-reports-922m-of-0-point-94-percent-cueq-from-surface-in-continued-expansion-of-warintza-central) \- Solaris Resources Inc  
   This one is interesting;

* In order to expand its shareholders’ investment opportunities, $SLSSF has recently begun exploiting new mining fields, the latest being [Warintza ](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/)project in South-eastern Ecuador, thus making solaris an acquisition opportunity. 
* The reason why I’m bullish about this company is because I have been able to consistently gain from their stock since 2018 though, in the past 5 days it has dipped by a margin of 2.65%. 
* Moreover, this acquisition has significantly been de-risked by being fully funded and availability of drilling resources.
* Also, a report from the [geophysical](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) investigation shows that  the copper in the ground is worth four or five billion and the market cap is only 1 billion.
* It is $25 to $30 Rio Tinto or BHP stock on sale for $9.25 today. This asset simply can’t and won’t exist in a standalone entity, when this cycle is over

mumhxi,gv6pjfl,StockMarket,comment,1618914009,"Couple years ago, when BTC had its first real surge  around xmas time reaching its first $20,000 mark.. BTC got its first taste of the mainstream media coverage. The fact the surge was actually due to a well coordinated pump n dump, it still served as a tide-like catalyst, wherein all the boats in that harbor rose with with it. There was some iced tea company that changed its company name to include Blockchain - while making zero changes or using anything related to  the block. Regardless, they got a solid 20%-30% bump to their price just by hijacking to the hype and swimming in the BITslipstream (for lack of a better term) 

Reason I’m mentioning that is - If the crypto stocks you bought into are legit and not just random fractional penny stocks hoping people buy shares because it has Blockchain or BIT in its name or ticker. If they’re sound mining operations or other legit crypto stocks, hold em. Because right now, there’s a catalyst for price surges happening almost every other month, if not faster. With the main difference being, this time - the surge due to manipulation. It’s all a byproduct of the slow (Although fast for their usual industry standards) adoption of BTC, ETH, NFT’s, and smart contracts by large financial institutions and market trend setters. 

Don’t be discouraged by red tickers or negative ROI just yet. Make sure you’ve chosen a solid company that is run well and has a positive outlook for their future growth mapped out and you believe it is attainable and reasonable. Past that, be patient and continue to monitor their growth, success - don’t concern yourself with the day,
Week, or even months prices. Crypto stocks are a long term investment generally. And if you’re hesitant on their sustainability once they do take off, sell some of your positions to recoup your original investment in them - keep the profits there and let them grow. Everyone’s system and goals are different. Just trying say don’t be discouraged, be patient, and trust that you’ve invested in a growth market that is primed to surge in the coming years.

* Said that while EVs will likely be on a slow penetration curve globally over the next decade, it would still translate into significant volume growth in absolute terms, from a low base

* Initiated FSR with buy, PT of $31, saying the company’s key competitive advantages are interesting product and its platform-sharing and contract-manufacturing agreements
* Initiated RIDE with neutral PT $13; sees RIDE’s underlying technology as less of a differentiating factor versus competitors, although its niche target market of trucks/vans/SUVs for fleet customers is logical

As I’ve been reading through the 2020 year-end reporting/results for firms in my portfolio, I wanted to take the opportunity for a bit of due diligence on Zoomd ($ZOMD), one of my winning microcap/pennystock tickers.  (FYI: I’m not your financial advisor, just another ape, so don’t forget a grain of salt).

&#x200B;

Zoomd is an adtech mover-and-shaker whose services include a site search engine for publishers and a mobile app featuring their state-of-the-art user acquisition platform.  The  platform unifies more than 600 media sources into a single, integrated dashboard. Through this service, Zoomd saves advertisers  significant resources that would otherwise be spent consolidating data sources. Furthermore, Zoomd is a performance-based platform that allows advertisers to pinpoint marketing towards target audiences using a performance indicator-algorithm that is focused on achieving the advertisers' core goals and objectives. 

&#x200B;

Despite global economic disruptions, 2020 was a great year for Zoomd’s fundamentals.  They witnessed sizable geographic expansion by clinching deals with clients as far-afield as India, Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and Japan.  Over the course of the past year, the company also successfully closed a number of profitable mergers and acquisitions, most recently with Performance Revenues in February 2021.  They also announced the launch of a self-serving SaaS platform that is complemented with a white-labeled DSP (Demand Side Platform) programmable advertising service.  

&#x200B;

I came across this clip that expands on some of the agenda-items I mention above:

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8DVInA2NI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8DVInA2NI)

Though ZOMD share price has witnessed periods of volatility, its glowing fundamentals earmarks these guys as a power-player on the rise.  I recommend potential investors and SaaS/marketing enthusiasts read through the Q4 results and do some further background research on these guys.",

2. Shell also transitioning to cleaner energy
3. Relatively cheap now
4. Paying dividends

2. Good implementation of online sales/shopping
3. Relatively cheap now
4. Paying dividends

⛏️👑 Barrick Gold NYSE: GOLD (15% portfolio)

2. Institutional demand is high (Basel III rules favor physical gold over paper/ETF gold)
3. China and other countries (recently Hungary) are hoarding gold
4. Relatively cheap now
5. Paying dividends (more and more..)

⛏️🪨 First Majestic Silver NYSE: AG (55% portfolio)
1. Silver will rise allong with Gold with higher upside potential
2. Industrial demand is growing with Solar/EV/Electronic industries growing
3. Commodity Supercycle is starting and boosted by Inflation / causing Inflation
4. Extreme retail demand
5. Starting to pay dividends per q1 2021

YES this is a BET 🤣 but the odds are in favor and could easily double my money so this is my yolo trade for this year..

🏪🪙 Coinbase NASDAQ: COIN (10% portfolio)
1. I believe crypto is here to stay and it's just the beginning (don't believe in bans in western world)
2. Coinbase offers exposure to ALL Crypto
3. Coinbase makes money on transactions regardless of regular price swings (Coinbase always wins like the Casino)
4. Current valuation is based on current fundamentals projected on the future... with BTC going to 80k/100k earnings will change dramatically to the upside
5. The masses who are now scared of crypto will accept Coinbase stonk as relatively 'safe' exposure

musequ,,StockMarket,post,1618931212,"the investment experimentGood morning. I'm kinda looking to try out an experiment for any of the new comers who are looking to do both long term investing and short term investing.  The concept would be to buy and hold 1 year of index funds. The other would be a month to month change of trades.  I'm more curious of the DD that this community can do in terms of how they go about looking for stocks but this would some what serve as scenarios that would basically become a what if game for those who are skeptical to investing. 

It would be great to help at least 1 person see if the idea of investing is as smart as it looks. I'd be willing to share the numbers and value as a progress format to better help give visual to this experiment. 

The funds would be 1,000$ a month. this would give a fair, or rough representation to those who are looking to make a start. This wouldn't be the funds needed to start as this 1,000 would get divided in half so as to better show and represent both long term and short term practices with smaller funds. 

I'm not sure if this will take off and honestly I'm betting there are folks in this subreddit who are more than invested already but I would like to get a good feel of what the community thinks. It would be great to make this as a sort of hub or maybe a small space in the subreddit to help newer investors mostly because the whole go learn on your own gets pretty worn out.

muky24,gv6f2cr,StockMarket,comment,1618903782,"> Is there an explanation for this

I guess you haven't been paying attention, but, yes, there is.

It's called the FedResInk (The Federal Reserve Incorporated).

They have engineered a situation where any increase in interest rates will produce a default on the debts they have allowed to be created.  The prevailing ""risk free rate of return"" maintained by the FedResInk is effectively a negative rate of return after inflation is factored in to the equation (some people have started calling this ""return free risk"").

The result of this mess is ""TINA"" (There Is No Alternative), which requires people to put their money into assets that at least keep up with inflation (I like to call these assets ""TINAssets"").  These assets include, in no particular order, real estate, stocks, silver, gold, collector cars, airplanes, boats, sneakers, guns and/or anything that isn't kept in a savings or money market account and doesn't have an inherent vice that becomes obvious in a couple of weeks/months.  TINA has displaced FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), wherein rampant speculation is no longer practiced by those can't stand missing a boat, but, rather, has become sound investment strategy practiced by everyone who isn't innumerate.

But, you should relax, because there's hope on the horizon.  See, in about six months, everyone not paying their mortgage or rent, because of forbearance/moratorium, will need to adjust their money allocation philosophy.  The money that they have been dumping into various speculative instruments and TINAsset classes will need to be applied to things like rents and mortgages... and just when they were depending on TINA to save them from the FedResInk, they will learn that small consistent inflation is far better than sudden catastrophic losses.  Hopefully, they only dumped government stimulus money into their TINAssets.

The down side to this entire state of affairs is that if inflation gets truly out of hand (and make no mistake; when TINAssets crash, it will be indistinguishable from inflation), the only way to extinguish it will be to massively increase interest rates (see Volcker circa 1980)... which, in turn, will produce defaults on trillions of dollars (double digits worth if you count immediate debts and triple digits worth if you count future debt obligations).  This is called a ""rat race"" or a ""paradox"" and it is one whose conclusion/resolution we are rapidly approaching.",

QuantumScape stock dropped more than 12% on Thursday after short seller Scorpion Capital published a report questioning the company's claims about the performance of its batteries.   


QuantumScape stock was up about 4% in Friday trading.   


Scorpion's 188-page report contains partial quotes from interviews with former employees of QuantumScape and battery experts. Simply put, Scorpion tells Barron's it doesn't believe the company's claims about its battery technology and that it misled investors.   


QuantumScape management pointed Barron's to a thread on the company's Twitter account posted in response to the report. In the social media post, the company denied some of Scorpion's claims, reviewed data published about its technology, and said Scorpion, as a short seller, has a financial incentive to see the stock price drop.   


""QS stands by its data, which speaks for itself. We have provided higher transparency than any other solid-state battery effort we are aware of,"" QuantumScape said on Twitter Thursday evening.   


In the report, Scorpion said it has sold QuantumScape shares short, meaning it borrowed stock it doesn't own and sold it, hoping to replace the borrowed shares at a later date after the price has dropped. Short selling is a common hedge fund practice and many short sellers believe it's important to have some skeptical voices reflected in stock prices.   


One claim levied in the report hits at the heart of the company's technology: Scorpion said QuantumScape must use a liquid electrolyte in its solid-state batteries. Unlike today's electric-vehicle battery technology that has a liquid medium to facilitate electrical current, QuantumScape says its solid-state batteries have no liquid electrolyte.   


Scorpion's claim is based on interviewing battery experts. There are no QuantumScape batteries in the marketplace to examine. QuantumScape did not specifically address the accusation in its Twitter post.   


The electric-vehicle battery pioneer's technology is new and arcane, involving discussions of temperature, milli-amps, and multiples of atmospheric pressure. QuantumScape is developing solid-state lithium anode rechargeable batteries that promise lower cost, higher range, better safety, and faster charge times for electric vehicles. Success would be a panacea for the electric vehicle industry.   


QuantumScape's technology hasn't worked in automotive applications yet for a host of reasons, but the company appears to be making progress and is backed by Volkswagen (VOW3.Germany).   


This isn't the first time electric-vehicle investors have had to weigh accusations made by short sellers. Nikola (NKLA), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), and Arcimoto (FUV) have all been targets of skeptical reports. In all three cases, the companies disputed the claims. Their stocks have fallen below where they were trading before the reports were published.   


Short sellers aren't the only reason electric-vehicle stocks have been trading lower. Many smaller, high-growth technology stocks have sold off sharply in recent months as interest rates rise. Roughly 200 SPACs that Barron's tracks are down about 25% from 52-week highs, on average. Those highs came around late January.   


Investors have started focusing on more traditional stocks with leverage to the overall economic recovery. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both up roughly 9% over the same span.

[https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article250792044.html](https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article250792044.html)

To champion Bidens infrastructure plan (and the billions that will be sat aside for electrification of the federal fleet and school buses) he is virtually touring the factory.

ACTC has been hit hard by the recent SPAC attac and the SEC's push to potentially look into SPAC's and the way they communicate forward-looking styatements.

ACTC has always looked like a good short-term play to me on the upcoming merger + infrastructure but certainly has some merit as a long-term investment being the largest US player in the EV bus field, with a ready-for-market product, 17M miles driven, over 1,000 buses sold, and orders waiting for fulfillment.

The recent announcements of sales to multiple cities (Chicago CTA, Juneau AK, Charleston, and many others) and being approved by the state of Washington for state contractual purposes should have juiced the stock but the ""SPAC attac"" has left it down 10% over the past month.

It appears this news will juice it up and hopefully that will lead to a nice peak when the merger is finalized end of April or Mid-may.

Previous forecasts were $28-$30 pre-merger but this can be higher if the infrastructure news, merger news, and Bidens visit (depending on how long the hype lasts) all bouy the stock at the same time.

mu3w35,,StockMarket,post,1618848276,"My Trading Plan Template That Made Me Consistently ProfitableIn my trading career beyond having a strategy (actually multiple depending on market state and asset class) to base my trades on nothing has ever been as important as having a Trading plan. In this post I want to share with you my personal trading plan to help you create a set of rules that will help you stick to your plan and keep your emotions in check so that you can actually follow your trading strategy and become a consistently profitable trader.

Something that was and still is key for me is the following realisation:

Never get attached to your opinion or view of why something should happen. The market is in fact always right and based on nothing but irrationality since its made by humans so the movements of the market do not have to make sense and at more times than not will not make sense.

Trading is simply a mind game. Markets are a result of mass psychology which leads to exploitable edges. Mastering your own psychology is key to keep following the strategy that defines your edge.

So now without further ado my trading plan template that has helped me so much over the years and I hope will help you as well:

**\*\*General Rules\*\***

1. Never enter a trade without a plan (TP,SL)
2. Once you are in a trade stick to the plan
3. Its ok to be wrong its not about being right its about making money
4. Be patient do not act on FOMO
5. Do not chase the market
6. Let your winners run and cut your losses short

**\*\*The 5 fundamental truths\*\***

1. Anything can happen.
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money.
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge.
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another.
5. Every moment in the market is unique.

**\*\*Rules of consistency\*\*I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE:**

1. I objectively identify my edges.
2. I have predefined risk of every trade.
3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them.

**\*\*Risk and Money Management\*\***

Do not increase the standard trade size before you doubled the account.

1. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose in a day is $XXX.

 2. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose on any single trade is $XXX.

 3. The maximum number of losing trades in a row you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is three. 

4. The maximum number of losing trades you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is five. (You may have had a win or two between losses, but there is a time to stop trading.) The maximum number of losing trades in the same direction you are allowed to take in a day before you stop trading is two.

 1. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the current price to protect a portion of those profits. 

2. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will take the money and close out the trade.

 3. If you are up $XXX for the day, you will take the rest of the day off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading

4. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the month's profits to protect a portion of those profits. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will take the rest of the month off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading! Take a vacation, sleep late and read books, or do something else fun.

I created this trading plan years ago and am only sharing it with the community now (never spent much time on social media). It is a mix of my own ideas, ideas from fellow traders and books I have read over the years. One book in particular that I highly recommend and that has hugely influenced my trading plan and journey as a trader is: Trading In The Zone from Mark Douglas.",

mumq25,,StockMarket,post,1618911599,"Naspers vs Amazon South AfricaI am from South Africa and need some advice regarding Amazon announcing that they will set up a headquarter in South Africa in the next 3-5 years.

Some background - The City of Cape Town in South Africa has greenlit an R4 billion River Club mixed-use development, which will be the new home of retail giant Amazon in Africa.

Up until now, we did not have Amazon in South Africa but we have a similar concept called Takealot.

Takealot has grown at 90% over the past four years, now sells over 3.5 million products, has generated R2.3 billion in annual revenue and employs 1 200 people (2017 figures)

It’s not uncommon for Takealot to be compared to Amazon. Like the US-based online retailer, it has become the dominant force in their respective e-commerce sectors.

One area where they differ is in delivery. Amazon uses courier companies and the US Post Office to make sure its packages get to their destinations. For its part, Takealot delivers the packages itself via its Takealot Delivery Team (formally Mr Delivery). It also does deliveries for its subsidiaries Mr D Food and Superbalist.

Takealot is largely owned by Naspers Open: 3 460.02 (20 April 2021)

Now my question: Would it be wise to invest in Naspers assuming that Amazon will likely either buy Takealot out or try to negotiate a delivery infrastructure agreement as in South Africa our Post Office is not at all an option?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",['AMZN']

mu9xie,,StockMarket,post,1618864628,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 19, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 19, 2021**

Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) retreating from record levels with the benchmark Treasury yield climbing and market participants taking profits off the table after the recent record run. Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. 

Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

Hi all,

I hope everyone is well today but i have a question for you all.

As im starting out with such little money in it i was wondering whether It would be best for me to sell at a peak of a spike and rebuy in with that whole amount again on the downfall to the bottom to get more shares. I only put in what i can afford. But want to making more money!

1 I’d have more shares BUT at a higher average. Would the return be greater (obviously due to the extra shares it would) but the return would be smaller due to the sell I done?

I hope this makes sense, Im dyslexic for something make sense to me might not make sense to you 😂 if it did, then great.

Thanks in advance

Example: I have 105 shares of SOS @ an average of $6.50 when the price gets to $20 I sell and a dip happens down to $12.50 - $15 I buy back in. Or would it be more beneficial to just hold what I have so get more return for my money",

What you are on about is a fools way to make a profit especially if you don't know the market 100% 

It can work the 1st time and the 2nd time then on the 3rd time you will lose as the stock runs up without you don't try it 

The best way to make money is to buy a good quality stock that you believe will do well over the next 3 to 5 years then hold the stock if the price drops them buy more of your stock at a discount and hold for a 100% to 1000% profit",
muk0qr,gv6ilje,StockMarket,comment,1618907192,"Sell and buy back in. Using your example of selling at $20 and rebuy at $12.50 you go from 105 shares to 168.

When the price is down your money will buy more shares, when the price is up your money buys fewer shares (i.e. don't buy the same number of shares each month, invest the same number of dollars). 

Typically, you'll get about a 15% return if the price at the end of the year is the same as it was at the beginning (because you bought more shares when the price was lower). Long term the price will go up and will add to your gain, but that's gravy.

mui9mg,,StockMarket,post,1618891577,"Impact of Biden's corporate tax hike?Seems like the proposed corporate tax hike by President Biden is gaining traction as he lumped it all in this trillion dollars infrastructure plan. Do we know what the timeline is on him getting the tax hike through the senate or Congress?

How would you change your investing strategy for the possible impending corporate tax hike? Will blue chips and FAANG be hit the hardest?

www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/ceos-warn-biden-tax-hike-will-hurt-economy-as-battle-lines-drawn-in-washington-11618245984
The Biden administration wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% to help pay for its $2.3 trillion proposal. Included in the plan is a substantial amount of spending on traditional infrastructure projects such as road building, bridge repair, port improvements and the like.
Companies have a range of choices when their taxes are raised, economists say. They can raise prices on customers, limit wage growth, cut spending, accept lower profits, give less money back to shareholders — or move to lower-cost locations.",['AMP']

mui9mg,gv62qz7,StockMarket,comment,1618893770,"Idk if I’d call a 4% increase a “hike” but i can’t see it really mattering in the long run unless they close loopholes. Something like 41 companies in the S&P 500 pay zero in taxes or have a negative tax rate.

The market may react, but it won’t effect much considering the rate used to be 35% until 2018. In fact, if the market does react poorly, it would be a great opportunity to buy. Especially if they’re involved in the infrastructure package.

Edit: Besides, most large companies didn’t use their tax savings wisely. Choosing instead to do buybacks and management bonuses.

Edit 2: The 28% figure is out of date due to some resistance in the Senate. The new figure is 25%.",['SPGI']

I created an investment tracker, which tracks both cryptocurrencies and stocks. The beauty of this tracker is that it packs some awesome analysis tools and provides you with live data from cryptocurrencies. Since this is only the first version, I would love to hear what you think of the spreadsheet!

So what are these analysis tools I am speaking of?

* A neat dashboard which gives you an overview of your investment
* The ability to track two different categories of your stocks (e.g. short-term investment & long-term investement, but you can name it anything you want)
* A newsfeed for all the stocks you own or general cryptocurrency news
* Financial summary for any stock you wish to analyse exctracted from finviz
* Graphical display of different allocation of your categories, accounts and subportfolio
* Return on investment for different categories as well as your overall investment

Another awesome feature of this investment tracker, is that it is created to be as dynamically as possible. The idea is that you, as a user, only have to input the data of in the “Setup” sheet and the “History” sheet. The rest should be calculated automatically. You can find instructions on how to use the investment tracker in the sheet ""Instructions"".

Instructions are written on the ""Instruction sheet"". If things are still unclear for you, please be sure to leave a message here.

For those new to this:

I have built a python algorithm that scans social media to identify which stocks are being discussed. It does this by assessing the amount a stock is mentioned, the sentiment of the chatter surrounding that stock (how positive or negative that chatter is) and the interactions surrounding that chatter (upvotes, likes, retweets etc.)

The algorithm surfaces emerging stocks by looking at which stocks have seen a regular, non-spiky increase in chatter surrounding a stock.

The algorithm tries to remove pump and dump stocks by removing stocks that have seen a single spike in chatter, and ignoring chatter by newly created or bot accounts.

It is meant to be used as a way to identify stocks early, enabling you to perform research and enter into a stock at an early stage. It has allowed me to identify opportunities such as DDD,PLUG, SRNE, PLTR and MGNA.

*Just because something appears here does not mean you should purchase it. Please do your own research beforehand!*

# Results

There are two sets of results, showing the stocks with the biggest movement in chatter, and the stocks that were talked about the most.

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday.

* the ""customer support"" helpline basically doesn't exist. They stated in the past that they will make changes due to that suecide that happened: but if anything it got worse. You can't even call them right now, you're just redirected to their website when you call (was called and brought up in the first conference). Aka lying 

* the obvious gme stuff, + restricting dozens of other stocks without any notice, or explanation afterwards (for 3 months) 

* the obvious manipulation/swindeling that happened in Congress GME, where the CEO basically refused to answer any and all questions. See: ""when I was born in Bulgaria"" 

* tens of thousands of users reported that, while they had a cash-only account / or had made purchases with funds that they had and didn't require margin , the funds used were ""margin funds"" /borrowed. This means a small interest was constantly being taken for years for some people without awareness. Some with hundreds of thousands of funds. (this was brought up several times in reddit: but notably in a ""I work at Fidelity, Ask Me Anything thread"" or something where a Fidelity employee was informing everyone that transferring funds from Robinhood to Fidelity was bringing up such an error. The entire comment chain from the thread were robinhood customers that were describing this exact thing.


Etc etc. There's issued with the company in so many angles, so many I haven't listed. 

Just use a different broker. You said it's options that you're interested in? Look at IBKR, they have the absolute best prices for options. Don't be discouraged from the ugly desktop client, the mobile app is much more modern and usable: and you can use the webpage for most~ things too. Like the research section on any given stock is absolutely amazing on IBKR. Saves me so many hours. 

The client is honestly not horrible horrible, I have specific things I want, and you can just watch a few YouTube videos to get the layout/specifics you want to look at.

 **Company states that they expect Q2 to be even better.**

We've seen a rise in various steel and iron ore prices only precedented in recent history by that which was seen in 2007-2010 ([https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-futures-streaming-chart](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-futures-streaming-chart)). At that time, Steel and Iron Ore companies recorded record profits, and many traded to their all-time-highs. With that, I've been monitoring the performance of the metals leaders in the U.S. and around the world:

\- It seems that these companies are again directly benefiting from the favorable conditions in the commodity markets.

Outlook:

>We remain confident that market conditions are in place to benefit the domestic steel industry in 2021 and beyond,"" said Millett. ""While global economies are still recovering from the shock of COVID-19, we are seeing strong steel demand coupled with extremely low customer steel inventory throughout the supply chain. The automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery, despite the electronic chip shortage, and the construction, equipment and transportation sectors are also strong. Our order entry continues to be robust across our businesses, and when coupled with historically low inventories, supports continued strong steel selling values.  
We believe this momentum will continue throughout the year and that ***our second quarter 2021 earnings will be even higher than our record first quarter 2021 results.***  
We also believe U.S. trade policies and existing steel trade cases will continue to moderate steel imports. Based on strong domestic steel fundamentals and customer optimism, we continue to be confident regarding North American steel market dynamics. This positive environment coupled with our strategic growth initiatives provide firm drivers for our further growth in the coming years.

Stocks rise and fall.

Stock falling:  
Due to sellers selling at a lower rate than market value and / or little demand and too much supply.

Stock rise:  
Buyers are willing to buy at a higher price than market value and / or high demand and too little supply.

Seeing this, how can we predict when 1 or more hedge funds, big whales are going to buy?  
It seems like a guessing game. Also the analytics are all nice parlor tricks, but unless you have the inside scoop from someone inside a hedge company or big whale you would never know. How would you?

Now these sites that claim to know etc, I think have a connection through 7 other connections to one of these hedge funds or big whales.

Think about it. We are human, we buy and sell when we need to. How would one be able to calculate when a big whale needs to relieve one of their stocks / accounts to serve another. There is no other way than knowing. Perhaps catalyst are a help to see if something will go up, but by the time you buy it since it was on the news the stocks normal price is no longer normal, but elevated.

mteym6,,StockMarket,post,1618759729,"I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results.**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/uur6fwi5ayt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f8ee2bafe16ef745dd3289826c503317135a40

Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. 

https://preview.redd.it/dcoh4td7ayt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb00595845533eba0e9dfc4769f0e1ac98a301f

Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think!

mteym6,guzdhhq,StockMarket,comment,1618763064,"The recommendations are all coming from Mad Money, which of course is aired after the market closes.  So the ""base price"" is the closing price for the day the show aired, if that correct?   So in order for an investor to achieve the same results, they would have had to buy (or sell) each stock at the close BEFORE Cramer made the recommendation?  

The investor would also, of course, have to have an unlimited source of funds: either they would have to have an infinite supply of ready cash (which of course would drag down their total return), of they would have to sell something in order to make a new purchase.  My point here is that following all of Cramer's recommendations would not result in the investor's achieving the same returns.

It's apparent that Cramer's recommendations do create a short term positive effect on the stocks, but that those effects are pretty transitory.  I admit that I don't really understand the ""Till Date"" line: it looks great, of course. But if the positive effect is pretty much worn off after one month, how can the return be so great when we're only 3.5 months into 2021?

As you may have guessed, I am not a fan of Jim Cramer. But it isn't because of WHAT he says: I just don't care for his whole hyperbolic ""schtick"". I have seen him on other shows. It's obvious that he's a very knowledgeable guy, and is capable of being very articulate. But investments should be based on logic and calmness. To me, his over the top persona is just as detrimental as Robinhood's confetti is accused of being.

mtdj7v,,StockMarket,post,1618755113,"Predicting where the market will go. (Don’t do this at home!)Am gonna try to do something here that people say is impossible/foolish - timing the market. 

Alright, to add some nuance, I’m not going to make some bold unsubstantiated prediction and blindly stick by it. I believe as traders, or at least active investors, while being cognisant that it’s impossible to consistently predict the market week by week / day by day, it’s also good to have some sort of awareness / bias to the technicals/forces in play in the market that will allow us to react better and make better decisions to maximise our gains. 

So, this is what I personally thing how the market has a good CHANCE to move this week - either flat/chop or down. These are just some of my reasons that make me come to this conclusion. I’m very open to discussion and differing viewpoints - that’s how we learn !

1) 4th consecutive week of STRONG gains, starting to look parabolic on the charts. 

2) Not to mention, on tapering volume - weak conviction behind the move. 

3) RSI getting overbought on weekly and daily. Negative divergence setting in on the hourly. 

4) Further overextensions from our moving averages.

5) Last week, utilities were the strong leader - this may signal a more risk off stance coming into this week. 

6) Dollar index, while have been falling, are coming into an area of support, where we may see some consolidation or small bounce this week. This is the same in bond yields. Hence might see a little more pressure on equities this week.

All these stacked on top of each other, points of greater POSSIBILITIES for us seeing a temporary correction as the market catches its breath after such a strong run. Hence we might want to consider looking for some short plays / protective hedges. That being said, we all know that the market can stay overbought and irrational longer than we expect. Thus, just want to reemphasize that until we have the benefit of hindsight, we are just playing with probabilities here. 

Personally, i still believe that we will see greater highs this year, just that we need to undergo a healthy pullback for us to catch our bearings, before marching higher, and this pullback seems to be due anytime soon. Some good support targets to cover your shorts / enter longer may be the previous all time highs. 

We’ll see how the market moves by the end of the week. If it closes near all time highs again - I’m perfectly fine with being wrong. It will just increases my conviction of an incoming correction.

mt8gi6,,StockMarket,post,1618731969,"Why are some stocks declining in the midst of a market rally? Bagholding in a bull run.Hi,

I think we all have been noticing that despite the broad market rally in the S&P, Nasdaq, DJI, there are a certain group of stocks that have barely moved, or in fact declined. I've observed that they fall into two main categories 1) SPACs, 2) 'reddit' stocks (like NIO or PLTR off the top of my head). 

Especially when the March correction was attributed to the bond yield spike that raised fears of inflation and interest rates hikes that would devalue the future earnings of a lot of these growth stocks ,where a lot has been priced based on their uncertain future earnings. However, we have seen yields start to **cool off**, allowing tech in general to rally hard, but not the aforementioned stocks. 

So I've really been scratching my head trying to figure out, why is this the case? I've thought of / came across some ideas, and really wanna find out what other people think or whether anyone can shed some light for me.

1) Meet Kevin pointed out that SPACs may still be suffering because of **SEC investigations** into them that is generating a lot of **uncertainty**. 

2) Another thought I came across is that a lot of these stocks were propped up by retail investors using **margin**, and when the correction occurred, many got margin called and **lost their capital**. This is even more pronounced for those who had been dumping a lot of their money into call options, fueled by euphoria, and eventually got devastated when the risk they were ignoring/negligent of reared its ugly head. Essentially, the correction in those high beta stocks **wiped out** a **great deal of retail investors' capital**, leaving them with **little firepower to buy the dip**, and hence the poor performance of these stocks. 

3) It may just be a technical consequence, where these stocks had went on a **euphoric climax** (too high, too fast), and when the rug got pulled and the dust settled, its natural that they will have to take their time to find some footing before they recover in the long run. One can consider a **rotation** perspective as well where these relatively smaller growth stocks / SPACs **strongly outperformed** even the Big Boys like AAPL, AMZN and FB during the past few months. Now, its the other way around. Of course, the psychology behind this technical observation may be explained by point 2 and point 4.

4) After the sharp correction in March due to bond yields and inflation scare, not forgetting the **archegos saga**, institutions and their **risk compliance committees** may have shaken off some euphoria of their own, got reminded that such stocks have a tremendous amount of future expectations baked in (and hence **greater risk**) that would be hard of them to swallow at these prices, and adopted a more **risk-off** stance towards such stocks, rotating back into more consistent, proven and stable plays like that of Big Tech. In a nutshell, institutions are **more wary and not as willing** to enter these stocks at this point in time. 

Please let me know what you guys think. Am really trying to find a *satisfactory explanation* for myself because personally I'm holding on to quite a number of such stocks and its lowkey demoralizing to see them continue to slowly bleed even though the market pushed into ATHs. 

There are also **no fundamental changes** in most of these companies, hence I cannot find a reason for myself to sell out (the *bagholding* begins). That being said, the drop in prices in some potentially promising names have made them more **attractive** and am considering adding more to my positions (just afraid of a **further decline** caused when the broader markets start to **cool off** after their **big moves up**). 

Just want to encourage and remind everyone, that when we invest, we are investing in the **company**, not the stock. \*Insert quotes about market being a weighing machine blah blah\*. Hopefully, we can take this time to do further DD and **reinforce our convictions** towards what we hold, and then baghold **proudly** and without shame.","['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'DOW', 'NDAQ', 'FB', 'SPGI']"
mt8gi6,guyfsgm,StockMarket,comment,1618742322,"Imo it was just a large market correction after the enormous bull run. Growth stocks were overvalued at ridiculous levels and seemed to only go up, then they were corrected and only the actually good ones keep going up now while the rest settled on a less ridiculous revenue multiple.

I know it’s impossible to predict the market but just curious...I’m no economic expert but it just seems weird that the covid crash was so short lived. I guess that was because the us gov bailed out the economy with billions in stimulus. And now the markets are at all time highs. It seems weird that after more than a year of millions dying and millions not working and productivity down because the world went into hibernation, yet the stock market and other markets immediately went so high again like nothing bad ever happened. I know the federal reserve probably did this to prevent a big depression. It just feels like an artificial high and that all of that covid terribleness will catch up finally to the markets and the free gov money will stop and then things will crash. Is it possible that something terrible can happen like covid and the gov prints lots of free money and there will never be a crash caused by this pandemic, and that a future inevitable crash will be caused by something else? Has there ever been something like this in USA history, like a great flu in USA back in like the 1900s or 1800s and the government bailing out the economy and then it crashing or the government just letting it crash without a bailout? Or maybe that covid was something that affected the whole world it is different than something that just mainly takes place in America like the housing crisis or the dot com boom? Will it be a sudden big crash or a slow downturn?

We know the boomers are retarded, but you literally cannot be that much retarded to undervalue this goddam stock. But enough with chit chat. I am talking about our favourite fruit #BB.
 
Just to put it into perspective… Blackberry has a market capitalisation of 5.12B and a total valuation of around 6B. Total turnover was around 890 million.
Just for comparison cloudflare inc. has a total market cap. Of 23B with a total valuation of 21B while having a total turnover of approx. 430 million. I know this isn’t the best comparison, I just thought it would be interesting.
https://de.wallmine.com/nyse/bb
https://de.wallmine.com/nyse/net
 
This company has transformed itself from a lost hero that made phones to one of the best, if not the best company making security software, yes. Security software, not only cyber security software.
 
Currently BB makes several interesting products.
QNX
QNX Hypervisor
Spark
IVY
AtHoc
And they even make a new phone (manufactured by OnwardMobility)
Information about the phone currently is kinda scarce but still interesting
https://en.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/blackberry-5g-smartphone-2021/
 
As you can see there is plenty of interesting stuff going on…
 
There are plenty of DDs posted on WSB for BlackBerry already and I would only tell the same news again so here is the link for the best one if you want to know more about their products.
Thanks to u/_MoveSwiftly for that great post.
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/
 
So what has changed since the DD I posted above?
 
BlackBerry released their earnings, which led to a big dip, that keeps dipping. Reasons for the dip? Honestly I don’t get it. There are literally only positive news for the future. But the boomers don’t care, they are probably still salty their favourite phone company from the good old days is gone and they don’t like the new touch tech.
 
Now the good… And there is plenty good.

mupgqp,,wallstreetbets,post,1618922651,"DD Positions Updates - $ASO $CLOV + why I'm buying $MVISOne thing that can be tough about reading what people post on WSB is not only knowing what the person writing a DD's positions are...but after a day, a week, a month whatever time frame...are they still holding? Have they sold anything?  


I thought it might be helpful for some people to see what I'm doing. I had quite a few comments on both my $ASO and my $CLOV posts. $MVIS is a new one for me today, and I will be buying some calls at market open.   


Two weeks ago I had gotten some ASO stock + calls. I sold my calls for a nice profit before expiration and got into CLOV on Friday. I had 3,000 shares of CLOV + these options below.   


As you can see in my screenshot I've sold off some of my CLOV shares....why? Well, I wanted to free up some cash for $MVIS. One thing I know is that there is a rabid hate for Jim Cramer in this subreddit.....and the $MVIS post u/s2upid with the Cramer video + his youtube video about microvision and then also the post by  u/OG_ClapCheekz69  about his micropenis (which made me LOL) give me some hope $MVIS has some real movement today. There is some good DD within the posts / comments around Microvision.   


Last week $ASO didn't move much...but it is this week. I'm sort of thinking that this week $CLOV might do the same. Often times when ""short squeeze"" gets mentioned with a stock...if it's not up 100%+ in a day or two...it's like people think it's not moving fast enough and get bored. Sure...$CLOV was up 20% friday, and what 8% yesterday? I'm keeping my calls in $CLOV because I think the strikes I bought are solid going into May 21.

&#x200B;

Outside of this, I saw a lot of people complaining about having red accounts yesterday, I was so deep into $CLOV I didn't notice it. As the 10 year yield rises, I'll be buying some calls on the VIX and I might even buy some puts on Apple today...because I think it's risen pretty quick, and the event today...it's ipads, airtags and maybe airpods, it's not that exciting...if the 10 year keeps going $AAPL will probably get some selling by institutions / money managers bc they're risk appetite is non existent. Maybe I'll write another DD on $AAPL before they report earnings / after the event if people are interested. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, updating on my positions bc often times when you write a DD...people get excited / hyped about something and then feel left in the dark not knowing what the person who wrote it is thinking. I'm still bullish on $CLOV $ASO and $MVIS.

muspbl,,wallstreetbets,post,1618932023,"Lumber Industry DDFirst DD so give me your patience.

Housing is fucking nuts in the past year as people move out of the cities and into suburbs across America and the world. This has led to great plays like UWMC or RKT, which have had their time and I would still argue are undervalued but that's not the point right now. 

As the housing demand went so high, each industry involved in housing shot up; mortgages are the most recent example, with RKT doubling in a week and UWMC seeing a 40% week earlier this march. Homebuilders like [TOL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOL/) and [LEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LEN/) have also seen enormous runups. These all make sense because houses are expensive and the volume moving on the market is obscene. The next logical step is not far from what the vitards pulled off with the steel plays like $MT: directing your attention at the most base material for all this shit.

**Stocks in question**

The stocks in mind are UFP Industries ($UFPI), a Michigan based wood and wood alternative producer, and Louisiana Pacific (LPX), a Tennessee based lumber product producer. I picked these two because they've both got solid results over the past year, are substantial companies, and have earnings coming as soon as tomorrow after close for UFPI. Their products go into American houses at every step, from the main beams to the siding, [and lumber has only gotten more expensive in the past year.](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber)

Lumber futures also signal that this will continue for a while: 

>Even the May 2022 contract, a full year out the curve from the current spot month, is priced at “only” a 25 percent discount. None of this is good news for builders or other professional buyers of nearly all grades of lumber, because they’ve got to have lumber to build, and the building season is hitting full stride as the calendar advances. These folks are paying up because they have no alternative, and there is no indication this trend will end anytime soon. The pros who use lumber will continue to buy what they need, if they can get it, even at elevated price levels.

^https://www.forbes.com/sites/salgilbertie/2021/04/17/lumber-prices-rocket-higher-as-demand-overwhelms-supply/?sh=2a2fe3cf21f9

The futures price of lumber regardless, there is a lumber shortage and those who stand to gain the most are those who produce it. Homebuilders too may suffer

> American Homes 4 Rent, which built more than 1,600 rentals last year and plans to construct another 2,000 houses this year, said its lumber bill is between $20,000 and $25,000 per house, up from about $10,000.

^https://www.wsj.com/articles/commodities-boom-hits-home-11615973404

Another nice thing is that LPX and UFPI have a p/e ratio of ~15 and ~20 respectively, so you're not buying into some overpriced trash shit even in this market of nutty valuations.

**Short Interest**

Don't ask me about the fucking short interest you fucking ape

**Positions to capitalize**

UFPI posts its Q1 2021 earnings tomorrow. Whereas lumber futures traded from 550-660 for most of Q4 '20, they rocketed up at the end of december and have traded between 668 at a low to nearly 1000 by the end of the quarter. For this reason, I believe that a strong earnings beat is very likely for UFPI, and calls would be great but the fact that they are only available for May 21 kind of is a a ball buster. I'm buying calls only but that's because I am poor

For LPX, they have earnings in May, but its not unreasonable to treat them the same. It is best to save the trouble of theta decay and wait to buy calls, but if UFPI smashes earnings then LPX may go up in expectations of a similar earnings beat as they have significant crossover in their products. 

**personal positions**

1 UFPI share, 1 UFPI 5/21 $80C, 1 LPX 5/21 $70C

I know alot of you have rules of entry and exit, but even then I am sure there is a mental battle to either panic sell and then buy on the rise, i have done it too many times lol. Now I am getting to the point of not wanting to be involved or invest because of the stress it has given me the past 2 months, even though I am up money, I am stressed over the potential gains I missed out on, especially when I knew better. So how do you guys deal with the stress, and remove emotion from the stocks.. because emotions lead to losses in my case.",
mulz5c,gv6mh3h,wallstreetbets,comment,1618911108,"The way I look at it, whenever you trade you’ll always have regrets. You either took profits too early, too late, got in too early, too late, didn’t put enough in at the beginning, etc. There is no perfect trade, and if you look at the charts later you’ll always wish you did something different even if you made money. Don’t look back when you take profits, and treat a loss as a learning experience. Setting trailing stops going in can keep your game plan focused and prevent you from getting greedy. And if the money you have in it stressed you out, you’re probably over committed. Try trading with a third of the money you have in your account right now and see how that changes your stress level. Remember the more stressed you are the less you’ll be able to make logical decisions, and that’s when you’ll start making the wrong call and getting needlessly risky.",

I’m just learning and have almost no risk tolerance. I consider this a learning period where I’m basically figuring out how stocks move, all the crap that happens and how to bail when need be. But to answer your direct question, after being stuck with stocks that tanked, I now set a stop sell limit around my initial investment. I’d rather break even than be stuck holding. This will unfortunately never make you money. Big money comes with big risks and as many of the apes around here say big balls to hold.

mubgbg,,wallstreetbets,post,1618868879,"A 14 year-old's Take on Algorithmic Stock Trading - TradeAlgoHey r/wallstreetbets, I've been working on a stock trading algorithm these past couple months. My interest in trading began this January and since I'm lazy as shit and I know how to code, I decided to code myself something that would trade for me.

For this project, I used Python and the TD Ameritrade API. I will begin by saying that the TD Ameritrade API is absolute garbage and you should use something else if you want to try something like this.

The code for TradeAlgo can be found here: [https://github.com/4pz/TradeAlgo](https://github.com/4pz/TradeAlgo)

TradeAlgo uses web scraping to pull a list of stocks which are predicted to rise already. After the list is scraped, each symbol is then checked to validate if they match the parameters set in the code. (These parameters are created by me after extensive research on how to predict a rising stock)

After this, the total balance of your TD Ameritrade account is pulled using the TD Ameritrade API and your total balance is split among the stocks which matched the set parameters. You can change how much money from your account is allocated to be used with the algorithm by changing the balance variable to the desired amount.

Finally, the buy function is called to execute all orders with a trailing stop loss to ensure minimal losses.

I've also included a way to only see a list of recommended stocks without actually buying them so if you want to make your own educated decisions after seeing what TradeAlgo advises, you can do that.

**Make sure to check out the repositories ReadMe for detailed setup and usage instructions!**

*If you have a GitHub account and can star the repository, I'd appreciate it.*

* have a last price less than $5 (should be irrelevant);
* have gained at least +2%;
* have a last price higher than the open (unnecessary given point #2);
* have a volume above 5M;
* have a float below 50M.

The 2nd point will lead you to buy high, will work when you're on a bullish trend until it doesn't.

mujiph,,wallstreetbets,post,1618896576,"My fellow PLTR apes should know the risksI love PLTR stock, I bought at DPO and sold half at 40 (where the valuation was just getting too dumb for a stock with 30-40% growth - I am planning to buy again when it declines more). 

The company is great and I can tell you first hand that they only hire the brightest to work there. 

But I want to teach you apes (the ones who want to hold this for 4-5 years) about valuation. Let’s do a an experiment, I assume that PLTR blows their prediction of 30% growth in the next 4 years and grows by 40% (that will be very hard to accomplish so this is a very bullish 33% average beat). 

We have a revenue of 1.1 billion for 2020, have that grow for 4 years by 40% (1.1*1.40^4 =4.2). That results into a revenue of 4.2 billion. When I use a PS multiple I assume they improve their margins and are not considered a consulting business- that would be disastrous for the stock - therefore, I am still very bullish. Splunk - which is a worse competitor has had an average 5 year PS of 10. If we apply a price to sales of 10 we are trading today at a 2024 PS ratio of 10! If we take an extra bullish view (we can apply a PS of 15 - which quite curiously appears in a lot of VC late stage funding valuations); with a 15 PS we have a 63 billion valuation which implies a 50% growth from here in 4 years. Which is insane especially since I took into consideration extra growth.

I know most of you 🦍 like to gamble but if you plan to hold this for 10 years this is a great pick, but don’t be surprised if in 4 years you’re up only 50%. Moreover, for those of you who like to gamble please learn to find run ups to catalysts and improve your chances of succeeding (if you want me to delve deeper into that leave a comment - there are surprising methods to the madness). ✌️",['UPS']

Available **Free Float** of CLOV is **109 million** shares. The **average daily volume** over the past 3 months has been **23.6 million shares**. We are are experiencing **10x average volume**!

https://preview.redd.it/s9t4dua587u61.png?width=1758&format=png&auto=webp&s=f181af59a503967370059a3ec08ed8fbd4d946a1

Now what is even more interesting is that not all of the free float shares are actually ""free"" because Chamath and his buddy Ian own significant number of shares which are locked under lock-up agreement.

https://preview.redd.it/v9os2ztb97u61.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b655e85966f06d425367687beb63aafa94640c4

This leaves us with approx. **60 million shares** up for trading assuming Vanguard wants to flip their shares (*unlikely but let's assume*).

Dividing today's volume of **230 million** with **60 million** gives us **3.83**. This means that **every available CLOV share exchanged hands today almost 4 times**!  


Huge volume + huge exchange of shares + relatively flat price = short ladder attacks  


Here is the definition:  
*To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.*

My theory is that whoever is shorting CLOV is trying to suppress the price until the hype dies down and hopefully gives them an easier exit from their short positions.

Since an emergency paid article on Bloomberg bashing Chamath on a Saturday at 9:00 a.m. did not work as expected considering CLOV went up today on a market red day, they have to think of something to prevent things from getting out of control.  


[Bloomberg is reminding us about SEC investigation, even though Clover has been awarded to operate in new states few weeks ago.](https://preview.redd.it/7dine2lwa7u61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7296f1fed7eff640158220f1cb1bff8b95e57a02)

&#x200B;

[Comparing stocks since their peak? Seriously Bloomberg? If this is not bias, I don't what is.

I know Hindenburg is not short, short float is wrong, Chamath is a scammer but I just can't help it. I like this stock for some reason.

Maybe it is my Catholic upbringing (didn’t take) that wants me to do the walk of shame (aka penance in Catholicism).  I’m feeling guilt after my posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7ggs3/cramer_on_plug_powers_stock_drop_i_still_longterm/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mmuvqh/plug_to_get_a_520_million_loan_guarantee_to_build/).  I bailed big time!  I feel bad if anybody bought $PLUG off my posts – though I understand I’m not the only beat-up bull on this stock.  And I’ll mention I did buy the January 25 ‘22 calls when plug was hovering around $29 – I’ll do another walk of shame in January or before if that doesn’t work out.  But I’ll understand if I’m not on some people’s Christmas Card list!

You might notice from my posts I’m a Cramer minion – have been for many a year.  That may not score me a lot of karma points here, but all I can say is he has worked for me.  I wouldn’t say I’m rich, but feel comfortable in retirement.  He just might have been at least one person responsible for that (sorry if that offends anybody).  With the Cramer video I posted he said he ‘liked the stock long-term’.  In Cramer-speak I knew, I knew I could get killed in the short-term – I got killed.  However he has drilled into me over the years: “**Diversification is the only free lunch in the stock market”**.  That has saved me, I’m not dead meat in retirement – just a bit annoyed.  And I’m more annoyed at plug CEO Andy Marsh.  I wish he would hit the airwaves and reassure us buckaroos out here the accounting error(s) are no big deal – over and over again would be nice.

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

muvxgc,,wallstreetbets,post,1618940600,"George Floyd Play of the CenturyListen up retards, we have the absolute play of the century on our hands.

I've been playing very close attention to the George Floyd trial, and anyone with a brain can tell that this Chauvin guy is probably going to get off. Regardless of how you feel about that, there is an opportunity to make massive amounts of money.

Everyone here except maybe the 7+ million members who joined since June 2020 remembers the [massive protests that took place](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) when that event first went down. These protests largely started out peaceful, but many escalated into violence targeting local businesses. One of the most targeted businesses during these events was CVS (ticker $CVS). [CVS got his so hard they were forced to close some locations!!!](https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs-closes-some-stores-looting-protests-2020-6) Let's look at what happened to CVS stock over the same period of time:

&#x200B;

[See that Drop???](https://preview.redd.it/jr83oz706du61.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=a464465a4ed3279cac2c39dfd8063576aa82dcd6)

You guys see that drop??? CVS dropped 10% in a couple of weeks right when all this was going on! So what does this have to do with the trial??? By my estimations, the outcry from an acquittal will be roughly 10 times larger than what happened in June 2020. Doing some napkin math here, 10 times of 10% is 100%!!! Meaning if Chauvin is acquitted, CVS will be going all the way down to $0/share!!! The market is clearly not pricing this in, as CVS is currently trading at about $76/share, $76 more than it is actually worth. 

With a verdict expected by the end of May, there is still time to get in on this once in a lifetime trade!!! I only wish I had enough capital to make (almost) unlimited gains on this play.",['CVS']

TLDR: PLTR is game-changing tech, has a deep moat and a huge TAM. But, the stock has been beaten down...and without any upside catalyst...will likely break the $21 support level and grind down to $15...or lower. I exited my position and have buy order at $15...all tendies will be reinvested in more PLTR shares.


AMAZING COMPANY
Much DD has been provided on WSB...so I won’t go into too much repetitive detail.
- PLTR software is potentially world-changing.
- They been developing/optimizing this software for over a decade...funded by DOD/DARPA.
- Their B2B play is just ramping-up...they’ll likely be working with 50%+ of the F500 in 5 years.
- Their competitive Moat is Challenger Deep.


UNFORTUNATELY, NO UPSIDE CATALYSTS UNTIL EARNINGS IN MAY
Lots of downside catalysts: 
- Insider Selling 
- Wall St/Pro investors still don’t fundamentally understand PLTR.
- Management shunning Wall St...not playing the quarterly results game.
- The DoubleClick Demo Day last week was a dud...a real missed opportunity...PLTR didn’t manage expectations...the presenters looked into space somewhere off camera...and awkwardly read instead of presenting the amazing tech...they also went too far into the weeds...only presented 2 client categories...and never presented PLTR client results...the stock literally dropped from $26 to $23 in a day...and is still grinding lower.


BRILLIANT UNIQUE CEO
- Love Papa Karp...and he is building a world-changing company.
- But, when the CEO literally tells people not to buy “short term”...what kind of message does this send? 
- Who wants to buy a stock and watch it grind lower without any upside catalysts?
- Pro investor have many shiny objects to chase.
- Retail investors don’t have unlimited dry powder to buy the dips.


UPSIDE CATALYST
I do believe May earnings will be an upside catalyst.  The stakes couldn’t be higher. 

PLTR must beat estimates or risk going single digits.",

A few bullet points for all y'all apes

* Cheapest e-commerce American platform on the market (accounting for market cap/sales)
* Americans in general more prone to spend money on frivolities given low interest rates and stimmy checks
* Huge demand of goods from China almost collapsed the supply chain. $WISH ships directly from China
* Rumor has it that Amazon offered 10B for WISH back in 2015 and CEO wouldn't sell (mkt cap is around 7B currently).
* CEO is an ex-Google employee
* Most downloaded play store app of 2018
* centralized hub for buying random/wacky shit
* Gamification of the buying experience makes users spend more on the platform
* The absolute apes at Loop capital have a $40 price target. The more trustworthy people over at evercore initiated recently with a price target of $22
* Exposure to international markets, not just the US
* You'd literally be buying @ an all time low valuation

People have a negative opinion of Wish because they associate the company with it's service/experience: low quality, scammy, generally poor experience, greed followed by regret, and often regret they didn't just go with Amazon.

You should check out [my first post on Coinbase + trading volume](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target/). Its shorter, does back of the envelope math, and offers a primer for this denser analysis. It introduces the claim that trading volume has entered new 'phases' of elevated activity \*despite entering and exiting bull cycles\*

In this follow-up post, I perform quantitative analysis on trading volume to potentially forecast profit. With that being said, most of these numbers are purely for reference as the analysis does not accurately capture all of Coinbase's revenue streams. Moreover, estimates around volume contractions make some firm assumptions that can blow up in my face.

&#x200B;

edit: ""volume"" is in reference to Coinbase's exchange (trading pairs that cannot be named). Volume does *not* refer to the actual volume of $COIN shares

# TLDR:

* I target a conservative 50 forward PE Ratio, given Paypal's 59.52 forward PE Ratio and Square's 204 forward PE Ratio
* If coinbase trading volume contracts half as strong as typical volume-contractions, **$556/share is 50x PE**
* If coinbase trading volume continues for the remainder of 2021, $800/share is 50x PE
* If coinbase trading volume contracts -36% (unlikely given institutional presence) $313/share is 50x PE

* **Charts are interactive**
* I will post updates and re-runs at the end of each quarter to see if my forecasts are worthwhile

# Methods:

* exchanges: Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Gemini, Binance, Binance US
   * I picked the exchanges that had substantial volume and were open to US customers. I included Binance as a way to get a temperature on the global trading activity.
* pairs:  (see the Colab notebook for the list, the names wont make it past automod)
   * I picked the largest trading pairs (by USD volume) on Coinbase Pro. While the smaller pairs do not influence the trade volume substantially, it provides a bit of a gauge when new trading pairs become available on Coinbase.
* **>> PHASES <<**: A new volume-phase is entered when the next 30-day average daily volume (ADV) exceeds the previous 30-day average daily volume by 120%. A phase contracts when the next 30-day ADV falls -45% compared to the previous 30-day ADV
   * these numbers are arbitrary and were chosen as they seem to model the volume-phases reasonably well without picking up the noise
* **Limitations**:
   * Coinbase Pro as a proxy for Coinbase, the main app's trading volume could also be substantial
   * Trading pairs are a curated list and do not capture volume in totality
   * Coinbase's fee changes remain unchanged [Source](https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1382279472599162880)

# 'Global' USD Daily Trading Volume + Phases

https://preview.redd.it/nm7p04lor5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b1136683aa37e592f7641b378af8cc4dbb89f1

* 'Global' as in across all exchanges and all pairs, mentioned above
* The current Jan 2021 breakout observes an explosive volume phase, and is the source behind Coinbase's eye-popping Q1 $1.8B revenue and $800M profit
* July 2019 will provide some guidance on the January 2021 phase. At the time, a record-high volume phase is followed by a contraction that is sustained and higher than the prior long-term volume phase (\~Janurary 2019).
* It would be misleading to not comment on January 2018's phase contraction. The favorable explanation is July 2018 volume phase is \~4 times larger than Apr 2017 phase. More so, the January 2018 cycle had 'altcoins' flaring to record high valuations, and are not entirely captured in the trading pairs provided. Additionally, the 2018 cycle likely did not have substantial institutional support that we are witnessing today

# Coinbase Pro vs. Gemini

https://preview.redd.it/1d1gvbmqr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3eb44ff085323d26a7b460a7955387b5718f47c

* This was a byproduct discovery, but Gemini's most recent trade volume seems to match the 2018 cycle. This to me implies that Gemini's user base has not grown aggressively as Coinbase's or its that institutional investors/traders have really warmed up to Coinbase. Bullish.

# Volume Phase Breakout + Contraction

How much does average daily  volume change between phases?

|Exchange|Average Phase Change|Average Phase Breakout|Average Phase Contraction|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Global|68.17%|157.4%|\-29.17%|
|Coinbase|54.16%|121.81%|\-36.04%|
|Binance|81.53%|152.4%|\-12.95%|
|Kraken|54.53%|129.3%|\-35.19%|
|Binance US|104.01%|148.87%|\-52.97%|
|Gemini|67.96%|178.26%|\-32.31%|

* Average Phase Change: the average % change between phases (regardless of up or down)
* Average Phase Breakout: the average % change when a new phase is *higher* than the previous
* Average Phase Contraction: the average % change when a new phase is *lower* than the previous

# Seasonality

https://preview.redd.it/0jpardbtr5u61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=51d24e7bfcde67827420ac4f666f162e64eafc6e

* To confirm that Q1 (and Q2 estimates) can be used for Q3 and Q4, I perform a simple seasonality check. For each month since 2017: what is the average daily volume
* The Colab notebook contains the sum of USD trading volume by month
* There's no immediate explanation for why different parts of the year would have increased trading activity, therefore I assume that trading volume does not exhibit seasonality.

# Forecasts and Price Targets

* Assumes that operational costs are $1 billion (Q1 2021 $1.8 Billion, 800 Million Profit)
* Volume contraction in Q2 is carried out for the remainder of the year (except for Neutral-Bear case)

**Using Coinbase Historical Volume Contraction**

|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|
|Neutral|\-18.02%|$2.23 billion|$556.74|
|Bear|\-36.04%|$1.25 billion|$313.49|

**Using Global Historical Volume Contraction**

|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|
|Neutral|\-14.585%|$2.4 billion|$603.11|
|**Neutral-Bear**|**-14.585% each Quarter**|**$1.77  billion**|**$443.09**|
|Bear|\-29.17%|$1.62 billion|$406.23|

* Bull Case: the volume does not contract at all for the remainder of 2021
* Neutral Case: the volume contracts half as strong as typical contractions, and holds for the remainder of 2021
* **Neutral-Bear Case: the volume contracts -14.5% quarter over quarter (Q2's volume is -14.5% over Q1, and Q3's volume is -14.5% over Q2, etc.)**
* Bear Case: the volume contracts as much as typical contractions

*Rough* formula:

`share price = ((1.8 + (1.8 * Q2-contraction) + (1.8 * Q3-contraction) + (1.8 * Q4-contraction) - 4) / 0.2 * 50)`

* `1.8` $1.8 Billion revenue Q1
* `contraction` 0.8 = -20% volume contraction
* `4` subtract operational costs. Q1: $800 million profit off of $1.8 billion revenue, therefore \~$1 billion operational costs each quarter
* `0.2` 200 million outstanding shares
* `50` 50x PE ratio target

# Closing Thoughts (Apr 2021)

The USD volume is exceptionally noisy and fluctuates aggressively. Tweaking the parameters can and will show an entirely different forecast. No one will know how, when, and where this volume-phase will end up; therefore approximating Coinbase's revenue via exchange volume has substantial risk.

But with increased institutional adoption, balance sheet reporting, and favorable discourse around cryptocurrencies, my own impressions believe that we haven't seen the volume-phase 'top' and I believe the subsequent contraction won't be extreme as previously observed. When comparing Coinbase against its competitors, its doing well to continue its growth. Additionally, this analysis entirely ignores other coins, trading pairs, and the additional revenue streams expected by Coinbase. Despite the possibility of a strong volume-phase contraction, I believe this analysis provides a somewhat incomplete picture and does not factor in other bullish cases for Coinbase.

In the words of Thanos, if we take each case as equally-probable, ""perfectly-balanced, as all things should be"", the expected value per share (average of each case) is between $556.74 - $603.11 (neutral case). I believe taking on risk head-first is a ""small price to pay for salvation""

mu7dep,,wallstreetbets,post,1618857660,"DD: MVIS go BRRRR and I don't care which way.My medium-term bull case for MVIS.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly.

&#x200B;

I'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said...

&#x200B;

I yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus.

&#x200B;

Positions:

3 GME @ 238

500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg

\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized)

&#x200B;

The most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected.

&#x200B;

In my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now.

&#x200B;

High IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums.

&#x200B;

Lets do some quick and dirty math.

&#x200B;

For our purposes we will use May 21 exp.

&#x200B;

GME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \~193% current price)

MVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \~182% current price)

RKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \~136% current price)

&#x200B;

So, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium / stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

GME: 5.387%

MVIS: 7.273%

RKT: 1.182% (IV is \~60%)

&#x200B;

At 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price.

&#x200B;

If MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too)

&#x200B;

If MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \*bought\* calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them.

&#x200B;

MVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, so let's talk potential gains and losses.

&#x200B;

Because my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!)

&#x200B;

If the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got.

&#x200B;

In summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high. I'm just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty confident in this, so I'm probably fucked. Please teach me. If you want charts and graphs, fuck you do your own DD. If you want rocket emojis, this thread is accepting donations.

For those driving without Autopilot but with the Tesla's active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 2.05 million miles driven. As for those driving without Autopilot or active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 978,000 miles driven.

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the *first Oral approved* treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with *hereditary angioedema (HAE)*, disease which is estimated to affect *1 in 50,000 people*.

Berotralstat is currently approved in two countries. On December the 3rd it got approved by the FDA in the *USA*, and on January the 22nd in *Japan*. The company expects approval of Orladeyo in *Europe* to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

CEO himself Jon Stonehouse confirmed in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) Orladeyo will annually be generating $500MM plus revenue.

\-Serge Belanger ( Analyst ): I think in the past you've talked about sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( CEO ): Yeah make sure you remember the plus.

&#x200B;

Before oral Orladeyo was approved for HAE, patients would only have treatments that required usage of *needles*. This dramatically reduced the *quality of their life*, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main reason why Orladeyo is a game changer.

After the approval, surveys on patients were done, showing a large number of new patients that were not treated before due to needles, now willing to be treated taking an oral form pill, Orladeyo.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 13), in their recently undergone survey 59% of the patients expressed high willingness to use Orladeyo, and that number rised to 71% with Physician recommendation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6bzzghklq2u61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c53c2b75315664ca4bdc96244a9843c40534194

&#x200B;

Additional surveys were undergone on patients using treatments from the competition ""Cynrize, Haegarda, Takhzyro"" and the results were[ the following ones](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 14).

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to 485,000$

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

The day Orladeyo received the approval in Japan, Goichi Matsuda, president of Torii said the following words ""Until now, HAE patients in Japan had no therapies approved to prevent attacks, so the approval of Orladeyo marks a significant advance in HAE treatment"", ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to bring the first oral treatment option to Japanese HAE patients and are actively preparing for the commercialization"".

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to $248,500

Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment from Torii.

BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales.

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's $248,500/year. This number should soon be confirmed.

Approval in Europe expected to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$

Japan - 500p x 248,5K  = 124,250,000$

EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of $2,628,170,000. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

\- On October 30, 2020 MHRA granted early acces for Berotralstat patients in UK

\- On March 11, 2021 Berotralstat received the early acces approval for HAE patients in France

\- On February 26, 2021 Berotralstat received positive CHMP opinion for Orladeyo

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating $2,628,170,000 a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of $18,397,190,000 meaning an increase of $104,46 in the stock price.

[Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/zratyvq0r2u61.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=41cd28426b365fec413eadee1236ee71904822e8)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

Rapivab is a bio-defense drug that is often stockpiled by the government. Last time being September the 26th, with a purchase of $14 million.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than $500,000,000 conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/7s0re83fr2u61.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd1c0a8f7dacfc31705d4e0f93577c4dddcaba3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

&#x200B;

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.  (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

NIAID on April 9th 2020 its expansion of the Brazilian yellow fever trial to include three cohorts of 8 severely affected COVID-19 patients, each being given a different IV dose regimen . Unfortunately, but obvious in hindsight, this trial was from the beginning underpowered to determine a clinical benefit. The patients were followed for eight weeks after their treatments.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

Despite all this and even though the trial was not even powered to detect a clinical difference in the patients, the NIAID, after finding an insignificant difference in outcomes between the small numbers of drug-treated and placebo-treated patients, inexplicably decided to discontinue clinical trials of it for COVID-19, to the great confused dismay of investors and perhaps even taken advantage of by short hedge funds who brought the stock down in late December.

Bear in mind that during this trial, one of the most lethal strains of COVID-19 we know of was affecting the Brazilian trial sites, later known now as the P.1 or Manaus strain, and could have easily negatively affected the clinical outcomes of this small trial too given that the trial was focused on very sick patients more likely to carry this bad strain.

Interfering with the replication process is a well-established antiviral strategy that has been successfully exploited in developing such life-saving drugs as the nucleoside inhibitors of HIV and acyclovir for herpes simplex complex. This approach could allow a single broad-spectrum drug like galidesivir to address gaps in the U.S. government’s medical countermeasure plan and to possibly replace multiple, pathogen-specific drugs for use in response to both natural outbreaks and bioterrorist threats.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than $1B this is 5,67$.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/fxrrrs1qr2u61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=7599688644c70cc0e49c002386039efc181bcca2)

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

&#x200B;

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at $75,000,000 = 0.43$

[BCX9250 value: 0.43$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/k683ekasr2u61.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=255260cf9ff156cde132c5ff8344b18528f62441)

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

This is how Bill Sheridan ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""*

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and excited about the incoming future of BCX9930. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the following words.

&#x200B;

*“Embarrassment of riches”*

*“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”*

*“My only concern is i have no concerns”*

*“Pipeline in a molecule”*

*“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”*

*“This is Big”*

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project*

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that[ BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to pivotal trials in PNH](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/7d6e0bdb-fc11-4653-a0cb-a8c64e159082) following the successful proof of concept trial.

The company announced that a Pivotal trial for PNH, and proof of concept trials in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021.

A pivotal trial is typically a Phase III clinical trial in the multi-year process of clinical research intended to demonstrate and confirm the safety and efficacy of a treat. A successful pivotal trial is required as evidence for drug marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""100 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 83 percent of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were *transfusion-free*. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

"" Hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3.5 g/dL in treatment-naïve patients and 3.2 g/dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

&#x200B;

To understand properly how positive BCX9930 data was, below you can find a photo were the main undergone studies in this kind of inhibitors is shown, with the results they achieved. What mainly should catch your attention is the Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline - This data has been gathered by Barclays.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it “Pipeline in a molecule”. Those 8 diseases are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to $28,56B - $51B / year. This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 ""  [Due to COVID-19, the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ **7023 million** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.](https://www.marketresearch.com/QYResearch-Group-v3531/Global-PNH-aHUS-Size-Status-13306748/)""

3 - “ Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for 1,65B - 3.3B market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""IgAN. The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds  45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential 7,25B market size using Soliris's yearly price  ""

6 - ""C3G:  Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds  2,31B - 23,1B ""

7 - "" PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning 7.25B""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B. More than 90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""”  C5 inhibitor, being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is.

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.

In 2019 Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,946.4 million. Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick example, using the average biotech mid-cap x7 revenue multiplier, and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019,  3,964B = 27,748B. It would mean a SP value of $157.56 for BCRX. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Phase II study**

Despite the company not PR'ing the start of the phase II study of BCX9930, the official page of[ clinacal trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04702568), show that the start of phase II study was December the 18th, 2020. This is extremely bullish since it reasures our thoughts that Ph I data readout will be good and enough to keep the study going.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a survey with 23 patients, 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris. The survey showed that 91% of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

Some of the patients treated with BCX9930 were asked some questions, among them, the 6th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill. As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill form treatments.

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a[ Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293), totally skipping the Ph2.

Additional proof of concept BCX9930[ Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335296) will be made.

Straight jumping from a[ ph1 to a pivotal ph3](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293) trial, is something that's not common in the bio world and could be taken as a really bullish sign. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it accelerates the process of development of the drug, giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time. The quicker the drug is in the market the better, and the more value it brings for investors.

&#x200B;

**4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential *best-in-class treatment*, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30% of Alexion’s buy out price, this is 11.7B meaning 66.44$.

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/c8fck3ytx2u61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2622d005e26eab918e1d33ae84bfe605f34b90a3)

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is. After recently increasing his stake in BCRX, along with BlackRock, he now owns a 5% of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789% in the last 3 quarters, showing strong conviction in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y598y4yx2u61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c5ce6aa1e60151aea85e69eaa850c8f3362f8e7

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate. A buy out coming from BIIB, company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors, would make total sense in the following 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

&#x200B;

It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates         ( Mergers and Acquisitions ) as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue growth in the incoming years.

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D""""""""  C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%. Being valued at 10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8gvx3g2y2u61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69e305f2683f4cc9681224addf471655fa54038

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than doable with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX at least expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo, apart from it, additional revenue generated by Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. With this agreement BCRX was funded with $325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch. Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".

Jon Stonehouse CEO, also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved. Showing how bullish they are on BCX9930 and their willingness to invest at it.

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company, obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo approval in Europe / Germany launch.
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the PH2 trials in complement-mediated diseases.
4. BCX9250 Next steps should soon be shared by the company
5. BCX4430 Galidesivir recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID. Next steps for Galidesivir trials may soon be given.
6. Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around 180$. The StockPrice fair value  number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.","['BAC', 'MRK', 'ALXN', 'JPM', 'BLK', 'BIIB', 'IR', 'STT', 'DE', 'PH', 'BIO']"

mu0hvd,,wallstreetbets,post,1618838571,"Supply Chain Disruptions and You: A DiscussionOK, so, I have a thought and I want your opinion on it. I've been trying to figure out why the market has been so choppy lately, even things like Semiconductors where they literally can't physically make enough to meet demand. There's a six month wait to buy a new refrigerator, and I haven't seen my favorite coffee product in over three weeks. 

Then it hit me. My coffee isn't out of stock because of unprecedented demand, it's because the supply chain is *so* disrupted that they can't get the resources they need to make it. I'll bet it's the same thing with Semis and appliances and all that. But how can that be? There was that ship disrupting trade for a few days, but I think a lot of people (myself included) are forgetting that it takes *time* to bring products to market -the more complicated the product or its components the longer it takes.

Covid. We crashed hard when the effects of Covid were first becoming apparent, but since then we've recovered, right? **Wrong.** Those disruptions have been working their way through the supply chain for the last year and they're just now starting to hit for more complex products as manufacturers draw down their reserves and find that their suppliers have been doing the same. Maybe the *raw* materials are available again, but that doesn't matter if it's going to take a few more months to turn those raw materials into components.

*If* that's the case, it could explain why industries like tech have been underperforming of late. There's a mismatch between the perception that we're returning to normality and the reality that we're still feeling the aftershocks of a nearly global shutdown in manufacturing and trade.

*If* that's the case, here's what *I'm* thinking is the play:

* Indices: Continue to moon. Sectors are coming back online and once reality catches up to perception even the laggards like tech will start to contribute again and there's nowhere to go but up. 

* High Industry: 🦘 Gang for a few months. This is where the majority of the disconnect is. They're not working flat out trying desperately to meet demand, the demand is there but they *can't* meet it because they haven't got the material to produce more than a pittance of what's required. How long did disruptions at the bottom of the stack last? That's how long these guys are going to bounce around as people variously pile back in but as many leave because they realize there's still a ways to go before the tippy top of the manufacturing stack is stable again.

* Retail: Tepid to mildly bullish. You can't sell what you can't have, but they've got a lot of pent up demand, and when they start getting things back in stock I reckon the ones that have survived will feed the bulls quite nicely. 

* Raw Materials/Mid Level MFG/ Transportation: Either back to normal or Moon baby. Depends, really. They're likely struggling to meet demand as well, but I feel more bullish on them overall. Their consumers are the ones who just can't get enough of what they want -High Industry. And they *can* be working flat out. This is where I'm personally leaning toward dropping my cash for a while. For them it seems like the disruption has largely passed and I'll be expecting big things over the next few months. The counterpoint, I suppose, would be that it's more or less business as usual for them, so there may not be a true moon shot.

That brings me to the final thing I'd like to discuss. Idiosyncratic vs Systemic risk. I've been talking in broad terms about entire industries or groups of industries, but let's face it, indices are a little boring. They're boring because thanks to diversification they're a bit safer than their constituent parts in isolation. This seems like a personal risk tolerance question -are you happy taking the risk that Bob's Copper Refinery is going to win the big contract (or not) or are you more comfortable riding the broader recovery through some copper specific ETF that I haven't found yet (at least not any that can be discussed here)? That's really a question only you can answer, but I'll let you in on a little secret: the big boys don't do either. They diversify, but just enough that their idiosyncratic risk (the risk that an individual company runs into headwinds specific to them) is mitigated. Even making a bet on two different companies in the same industry can *dramatically* reduce your idiosyncratic risk. You're still at the mercy of *systemic* risk (see the ARKs), but there's no avoiding that.

I'm curious what others think about all this. Am I completely off base? Is there a better way to play the final gasps of last year's shitshow? Tune in next time on, ""Madman Presents: The Slow Descent Into Bankruptcy"" to find out!",

Previous DDs so you can disregard them one more time:

**Updated snapshot of consolidated option position** (stock in separate account). Open calls, heavily weighted towards safer strikes because I'm a pansy. Position is understated both in total and net return by about $20k because Ally is hot garbage.

[Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160 ](https://preview.redd.it/xcprmy2ub7u61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=975fbcfbc92569cdc660d471ad5f391ce39a236d)

**TL;DR yet again** \- Quest performed over 10.4 million COVID tests during Q1 and base case testing has rebounded. They are still executing over $900 million in share repurchases over the next 3 months, which equates to a buyback of roughly 5% of their float. Then they have another $ BILLION of repurchases authorized for the back half of 2021 as well. Additionally, the technicals are some of the most bullish I've ever seen. And yet, the company still trades well behind their top competitor, Labcorp $LH. **I'll say it until I'm blue in the face from wearing these 6 masks, $DGX remains the safest trade in this market.**

**$DGX vs $LH** \- Look, I think I've beaten this comparison to death over the previous DDs, so I'll just add this quick table reflecting DGX share price as a % of LH. Note that prices are somewhat smoothed within each month.

https://preview.redd.it/rnve5wp4h7u61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8af65266c0df12e9022e4ba9b2c93cb04e4a6b

That's a pretty damn consistent trend isn't it? And don't worry, I know you aren't here to do math. If $DGX was trading at a conservative 60% of LH, it would be $156. Right now. Now, people can argue the LH Covance acquisition makes their growth prospects better than Quest. Maybe. But it certainly shouldn't drive this large of a variance.

**Charting / Technicals** \- Virtually all technicals are neutral or **VERY bullish** at this point. I also encourage those who like charting to checkout the 1-2 year trend. Then for more fun, take a look at the intraday trading over the last 60ish days. Look, I think charting is worthless 95% of the time as are technicals without a lot of context, but there are some obvious patterns in trading over the last couple months specifically. To me, it's clear institutions have been deliberately chasing out retail and consistently repurchasing at a lower price. On-balance Volume is soaring, which when combined with other metrics, is a great indicator of large ""smart money"" bets. This happens all the time. It's why stocks like Apple unexpectedly flatline for substantial periods of time, then make a huge move upward on ""info"" or ""results"" that you thought were easily foreseeable long ago.

**Institutions** and other big boys (or, conversely, dbag hedgefunds) - **13F filings** in Q1 and Q2 (so far) were absurdly bullish on $DGX, buying the stock at nearly a $4 to $1 rate. This is a much higher rate than usual for $DGX and VASTLY higher than the ratio of $$$ intuitions are putting into $LH.

**Shorts/shorting because this is WSB after all -** The amount of shares short is surprisingly interesting right now. Sure, an increase in shares short to nearly 4m doesn't seem like a lot on a float of 132m at face value. But $DGX has 90% institutional ownership, the majority of which isn't being moved (Vanguard is largest owner and Quest has a solid dividend). So the public/retail is really playing with 16m shares or so. Then factor in $DGX is repurchasing around 14 million shares this year, depending on buyback price. **Now that 4 million shares short becomes VERY material.**

**$DGX Q1 Performance -** I still expect a big beat, projecting over $4 EPS on a lower than expected drop off in COVID testing, substantial increases in base testing (core business), increasing acquisition revenue, and additional COVID research projects. Quest continues to flat out tell you they are still crushing COVID testing. Sure, it's down slightly from Q4, but remains much higher than 2020 Q2 and Q3. Adjusted run rate for April remains high as well. And now they will have base testing back again.

Here are the results.**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:**

 Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks.

Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think!

They focus on light metals (which is a desirable characteristic) and will benefit from the stimulus package. Their customers include Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar, Cummins, Deere, UPS, among other big players. They are projected to have a sales growth this year of 18%, followed by 8% next year on average. For the next 5 years, a growth of 12% average.

Last year, their sales were 5.67B and their market cap is half that, at 2.84B. They have a target price of $36. Last year, they had a loss, but previous years puts their profit margin at \~2.5%. It's small, but profitable. Their debt and liabilities grew considerably last year (debt to assets ratio of 77.3% up from 41.5% in 2019), but if you believe they'll get their shit sorted.

mtkyw2,,wallstreetbets,post,1618778361,"CLOV DD - No BullshitCLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are “non-tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the ""Hindenberg said this” and “S3 said this” bullshit that people have been arguing about...

But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS

Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here’s why:

The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \~30M short volume on 4/8 and \~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.

https://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d

The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it’s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let’s get into the shit that really matters.

First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)

https://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e

* MACD bullish
* RSI only starting to warm up
* Decent support built between $7-$7.30
* But what’s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.

**Now let’s get into call volume**

[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)

https://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed

Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:

* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS
* Hindenberg short report
* Short seller price manipulation

The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.

Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: “Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)”

Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782

It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn’t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.

&#x200B;

**Wrapping this up**

Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC’s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.

&#x200B;

No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don’t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.

$CLOV to $100

EDIT: anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME, it's not. Holding GME, love the setup going into this week.

Also: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah

And for those asking about my position. I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance.

**Update 4/20:** people asking if they should sell. You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you.

Nothing has changed. The market dumped and people sold. If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over. Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control.

Long term, my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy. Dips are opportunities. Not worried.

If your curious why these trends appear common for any ticker, it is because options are priced based on quantitative models (Black-Scholes, Bi-nomial...). The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. 

Curves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. 

With skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack. Meme stocks like GME and AMC have way overpriced OTM calls for example

musq5y,,wallstreetbets,post,1618932087,"$GOEV - the next squeeze?TLDR: $GOEV has been shorted heavily over the past 2 weeks. There are currently 0 shares left to borrow and borrow rates were in excess of 40% yesterday. GOEV has a history of failure to deliver; combine this with high call option volume, and you have a lot of tinder. If the share price reverses (and depending on how quickly) this could be a prime squeeze candidate.

Canoo ($GOEV) has been beaten into oblivion over the past 2 weeks, and now trades at a steep discount to the SPAC vehicle that acquired it. This came after a disappointing earnings call and a major shakeup in the business model as well as leadership. Obviously there is a lot of FUD in the stock, and shorts have taken advantage of this sentiment to drive down the price. 


**No Shares Available to Borrow:** In fact, the amount of shorting over the past 2 weeks has now resulted in 0 shares available to borrow (according to fintel).

https://imgur.com/a/YLQSnS9

**High Recent Short Volume:** As you can see there have been ~10M shares sold short over the past 2 weeks, and GOEV already had a 15% short interest before this. Add this all up you could have anywhere from 50-60% of the float currently sold short.


**Failure to deliver:** GOEV also has a history of high failure to deliver whenever the price spikes. There were over 1.1M shares that failed to be delivered on 03/22. This indicates that shorts are overextending themselves.


**Gamma Squeeze Potential:** There is also extremely high call volume for the $10 and $15 strike, so if it starts to approach those price levels there will be increased buying pressure due to gamma hedging. 

Main takeaway: If the stock starts to reverse course before the shorts cover this could jump very fast to $10-15 again. Because of this, I will be opening a small long position.

mu2e0e,,wallstreetbets,post,1618844171,"FLR - Commercially Viable Small Modular ReactorFluor Corp produces a small modular reactor that yields 77MWe of power in a reactor that fits on a transport truck and can be shipped into disaster zones to rapidly rebuild infrastructure, be deployed into factories for on-site generation, or scattered through out suburbs and commercial zones to generate the power near where it is consumed. 

These reactors are a modern “safe” variant which burns the majority of its fuel producing minimal waste. 

Fluor is not just a nuclear reactor producer they are an American international engineering and construction firm. Their divisions include Energy, Chemicals, Mining, and Infrastructure. 

Fluor Corp has taken on infrastructure projects in the wake of American wars abroad. In Canada they are building the Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) export facility in British Colombia. They are building the “Automated People Mover” at LAX which provides automated tram services. With Bayer they are building their state of the art Cell Culture Technology Center. They build mines, casinos, hotels, reactors. In general they are a world class infrastructure producer which bodes well in the coming infrastructure projects under the present administration.

As the economy slowly picks back up and with infrastructure around the corner, this stock is a strong long term play that should hit a serious catalyst when this admins infrastructure projects begin. 

To quote Zacks: 

“It has a solid track record of receiving awards and management is optimistic about continuation of this trend in the future as well, which is expected to drive growth. The company, being an industry leader in nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the United States, is expected to benefit from the rising demand for energy across the globe.”

mtmvnz,,wallstreetbets,post,1618784292,"$TSP (TuSimple, autonomous truck tech that IPOd this week) is a scam -- DD insideThis isn't investment advice and I'm not making any claims that **TuSimple is a fucking scam**, I'm just a retard.

From TuSimple's [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm):

> Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (“HD”) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, and an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite and components.

In the world of autonomous driving, L4 is the point of full automation and a human isn't needed in the vehicle at all. And technology with a 1,000 meter range doesn't exist (the 35 second ""planning horizon"" is a direct result of the range - it's the amount of time to react at highway speeds).

This article [discusses TuSimple's gear setup](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/article/14197547/autonomous-vehicle-technology-shifts-to-a-more-realistic-gear):

> TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.

Let's go over that again:

 * LiDAR range - 200 meters

 * Microwave radar range - 300 meters

 * **Magical HD cameras that claim to be able to identify vehicles 1,000 meters away - are you fucking kidding me?** I can't link to YouTube, but find the video ""TuSimple's Delivers Enhanced Night Vision Capabilities with New Camera System"" and you'll see that TuSimple's supposed ""improved"" camera is actually less clear, it's just better with headlight glare, and sure as fuck doesn't have a 1,000 meter range

They claim their technology can see [up to 1,000 meters away - triple the range of any competitor](https://www.tusimple.com/technology/), but they outsource all of their hardware and nothing on the market comes close to 1,000 meters. 

> Aeva Inc, a firm founded by former Apple Inc engineers to supply a key self-driving car sensor, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to [supply the sensors for self-driving heavy duty trucks being developed by TuSimple](https://www.reuters.com/article/aeva-tusimple-idUKL1N2K102G)

Oh, and when TuSimple [tried to demonstrate how awesome its autonomous driving system is, it failed](https://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/):

> The demo drive also, however, makes clear there’s work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: “Autonomous driving off.” Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. “I’ve got a freeze on my visual,” he tells Hou. “I shut it down for safety.” A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.

> And so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple’s garage. 

TuSimple hasn't sold any of their technology. [Their revenues are from traditional trucking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1):

> TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.

**TL;DR - $TSP claims to have self-driving technology that has three times the range of anything on the market, but haven't demonstrated it, or sold it, and the equipment they currently use is from other manufacturers. They have 70 trucks (50 in the U.S., 20 in Europe and Asia) on the road making normal freight deliveries, with ""safety drivers"" in the vehicles, and that's where their revenues are generated.**","['AAPL', 'HD']"

mtq4ij,,wallstreetbets,post,1618795473,"DD: Boomer Edition - CSX earnings this weekFor this week's Boomer Dick and Dividends we look once again at 🚂🚂Choo Choo!  No one knows what the fuck is going on with CLOV hard to tell with that ticker if they are selling healthcare or some other clever name for weed stonks anyway.  RIDE bombed out of their Desert race so EVs that aren't Tesla are going to remain fucked because it seems like new millennial mechanics can't figure out how to actually use a DC motor after hyping it for over a decade. (Hint: Plug in motor = ⏩⏩) 

CSX is set for earnings this week and they will almost certainly beat expectations.

Why?  Well there is a handy tool to track rail traffic for CSX available on their own site to track performance metrics which includes the number of rail cars online at any given time.

https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/customers/performance-measures/

If you download the data it shows that the number of cars online hasn't been this high since 2018 (so not just beating out the pandemic numbers but smashing 2019 as well).  Previous years had much higher numbers but CSX did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well.  (You can also see in the data velocity in 2017 was 14.7mph and is now 20mph).  

The short of it is that rail traffic appears to be up about 17% (technically it is 17% more cars online at a given time) while earnings estimates are pegging it at a 7% increase.

(Example of earning estimate stating this just recently https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-report-q1-earnings-low-155803201.html)

On top of that the the rail cost index was near an all time high in Q1 (https://www.aar.org/rail-cost-indexes/) which means that prices on rail freight were UP UP UP.  So they are moving more 🚂and charging 💵💰.  If you looks at earnings estimates regardless of the firm everyone seems to be pegging them at a slight increase from 2020 when the 17% increase was a sharp and almost immediate change on the year.  

If you need further confirmation from a non-CSX source the AAR also confirms that traffic is back to prepandemic levels of you remove the february blip from the Texas freeze.  CSX doesn't operate any lines in Texas so it is reasonable to assume that they weren't majorly impacted as their own data displays. https://www.aar.org/data-center/rail-traffic-data/

To top it off there is not a single part of the transportation industry that isn't struggling to meet demand right now.  CSX isn't going to be a magical exception and just have small growth when they have major lines throughout the major manufacturing centers of the Eastern US.  You can bet that they are doing it with less employees due to across the board labor shortages (listed as a concern in their annual report) and with an increasingly energy efficient line of 🚂 since they have been investing in and showing upgrades for years.

Pros: 

CSX is a profit heavy industry with government support that consistently out paces SPY as a long term investment even if you ignore the 1% per year dividend.

CSX is going to beat earnings because earnings were assuming moderate recovery vs the explosive recovery we got.  Almost no reason to doubt this and no reason to doubt they continue to do well throughout the year because as you can see in sky rocketing commodities pricing we simply cannot meat the demand for materials right now.  🚂 Are much 💪 vs tiny 🚛 when it comes to moving things like wood, steel and copper across the nation to be processed.

CSX didn't get hit by the Texas shutdown as they are an east coast outlet.  This means they will look better than several competitors with lines closer to or inside of Texas

CSX like all the major railroads prints money with a 27%ish profit margin year to year.  Railroads are a lifeblood to American supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years.  Government support and regulations keep the industry wide stability and growth in place with more and more companies realizing that rail is the ideal way to move bulk goods when you have smart systems to plan around the delivery dates.  As long as Tony Musk and Tim 🍏 don't start shooting our goods down 🧲 tubes soon railroads are going to be good for a while.  

Cons: Good earnings reports don't always mean good stock prices 😕🙃.  Lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped.  (Stonks did not like the last report but it also wasn't really that good).  $CSX did show very strong and steady growth after the last report so the real question is if there is a drop off on the report or not.  I lean towards no dip but it would suck to buy now and miss the dip since the last one was $10 drop 😕🚂💥.  

Time based Efficiency metrics are down a bit for Q1.  Trains are slightly slower and dwell times at stations are slightly longer.  Mostly labor based but it's still an issue for the slowest form of transit to move slower (note that vs 4 years ago they are 30%+ better).

Boomer Points:. 
🚂 Are an amazing and under appreciated form of transportation.  They are incredibly 👕 so the Democrats currently in power love them and they are big tough machines so Republicans tend to love them too!  It's vastly agreed upon that is long as you are a properly 💉 citizen that you will almost certainly love 🚂 and the way they follow simple patterns too!  💉💉💉💉⬆️🆙⏫=🚂🚂🚂🚂⏫🆙⬆️

Dividends: Essentially comes out to about 1% of the stock price per year if you hold it that long.  More or less free growth on something already beating SPY YOY.

Positions: I don't have any 😕.  Just saw this coming weeks earning notice has CSX.  Looked and saw it didn't appear to have a pre-earnings spike and decided that the rail data should probably show increased traffic since my companies rail cars keep getting stuck in station traffic.  The data shows a 17% increase in traffic and now I wish I had $CSX but I can't buy it til tomorrow.

Recommendations: Worst case scenario is probably that earnings randomly tank it for no good reason.  Last time it took a month to recover on bad earnings so if you aren't going to do shares then buy a call that ends a month from now.  No puts.  🚂💥🌈🐻","['TSLA', 'CSX']"

# Introduction

Hey, it's your girl Dry-Drink. Was a WSBs lurker for years, used to be that this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? But now it seems we pride ourselves on being retards who lose money for a living with options we don't understand. What happened to us? Here's to bringing back some old-school circa 2017 WSBs.

I've [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kspobo/true_wsb_leveraged_portfolio_continues_to_deliver/) about this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/) and strategy. I've gotten a lot of questions as to how it works and how to implement it so I've put together my definitive guide on this. From here on out, I'll just post updates of the portfolio performance periodically. I don't have a TLDR, unfortunately if you're interested in implementing this, you will have to read through this short guide. It's not super complicated once you get it, I promise.

# Glossary

Compensated vs Uncompensated Risk: The market rewards you for some risks, specifically the ones that cannot be diversified away (like overall market risk, or the risk of value companies). The market does not reward you with a return for taking on risks that can be diversified away. In other words, no one is paying you money for betting the farm on one stock.

[Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) Criterion: The percent of your account to invest in a risky asset to have maximum compound returns. For stocks, the Kelly Criterion is given by the formula [Sharpe/Volatility](https://www.cashchronicles.com/2019/05/20/the-kelly-investment-criteria-and-optimal-leverage/). So for stocks, maximum compound return (Kelly bet) is around 0.4/20% = **200%** (that is, you borrow as much money as you have, to buy twice as much in stocks as you otherwise could, by using leverage).

Margin Call: When your account equity is too low versus the stocks you hold, your broker can force you to sell stocks with a margin call. In other words, if your leverage is too high, the broker will de-leverage you automatically.

Portfolio Margin (PM): A margin account that determines margin maintenance with risk models instead of set leverage targets. It will typically allow greater leverage (**not that you should use more leverage than I say later)** and, most importantly, will let you [sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) for cheap borrowing with no effect on the margin maintenance.

Smart-beta: Catch-all term for equity indices or ETFs that are not market-cap weighted, but actually tilt towards additional sources of stock compensated risks (value, momentum and quality being the big three). Because these added risk sources are uncorrelated with the market, they lead to portfolios with higher returns and lower risk

# Background

For maximum compound growth, you want two things: Only take risk that compensate you, and take as much as it is optimal for max returns (Kelly bet size). In this post, I am going to show you the portfolio that has the theoretically highest compound return. History confirms this portfolio works, but don't invest in this because it worked well in the past or my updates. That the theory is well-supported in historical returns and practice is just the cherry on top.

Big-picture, the portfolio can be set up as follows:

1. Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms). You want country, currency and sector diversification to make sure you diversify away as much of the risk you don't get paid for and only take on compensated, equity risk. Using smart-beta further increases returns.
2. Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage). That is, borrow on margin to borrow twice as many shares as you otherwise could.
3. \- Bonus) [Sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\~0.5% borrowing rate, instead of Interactive Brokers 1.6% margin rate). This is not required, the most important part is the actual portfolio and level of leverage (steps 1 and 2). This is just a cheaper way to borrow.

**Note:** This is NOT riskless. On the contrary, this is a high-risk strategy, with plenty of financial risk. You can lose money and A LOT of money in the short/medium and, heck, even long-term. It would've lost about 83% during 2008 GFC, even more during the Great Depression. But eventually, it has and should come out ahead. All I'm saying is that it is the highest amount of risk that you would rationally take with a portfolio and hence, will have the highest average, expected, compound return. Taking any less risk (less leverage) should result in lower compound returns, that's logical. And taking any more risk (more leverage) also leads to lower compound returns (that's what the Kelly Criterion proves).

# Benefits

1. No position on volatility or downside protection (aka ""theta gang immune"").
2. Only takes on compensated risk. Better global diversification and access to smart-beta products than you otherwise could with options and futures.
3. Extremely tax efficient. It borrows as cheaply as you could with options and futures, but gains all stay unrealized.
4. Much more protected from short-term movements (you don't lose 30% just because your favorite stock missed earnings).

# Audience

The portfolio has the highest expected compound growth from index investing and requires little active management (no individual stocks or trying to time a trend). **Hence, it is ideal as a base WSB portfolio.** If you believe you can consistently trade for a living, that's great! You should probably ignore this post. But if you've lost enough money to feel like the market is a casino, here's a portfolio where you can let your money simmer and earn high returns before you decide on your next YOLO. I personally only use this; every time I have more money to invest, I just direct it into this portfolio.

# My Portfolio

I opened a Portfolio margin account at Interactive Brokers. You need >$100K for this (see below for smaller-account alternatives) I use a 60% USA, 25% Developed Market, 15% Emerging market split, all with low-cost, smart-beta stock ETFs. I've posted my portfolio on each of my updates but here it is once more. Again, just a bunch of stock ETFs that use smart-beta methodology, have low costs, and diversify globally. Feel free to use the same ones. I especially like Vanguard Multifactor fund (VFMF), the Schwab Fundamental funds (like FNDC) and the iShares multifactor funds (like EMGF). If you want something simple, a portfolio like:

30% VFMF

30% VTI

15% FNDF

10% ISCF

7% FNDE

8% EMGF

Is very close to what I use. Or feel free to copy my exact weights below. You'll see different positions because I tax-loss harvested back in March 2020.

[Current Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/rb14mo0640u61.png?width=2952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a242fe349528291cc664942edcacba378ef011f8)

So far, I am up \~108% annualized since June 2020 but, again, do NOT do this just because it worked well in the past. Do it because you understand and agree with the theory. I plan to do this for decades. I recommend you use Interactive Brokers due to their low margin rates. Although if you'll sell SPX boxes to avoid the margin rates, you could do it anywhere that offers portfolio margin (ex: TDA).

# Managing the Portfolio

You opened a Portfolio Margin account, bought twice as much in stocks as you had money for (using your ideal ETFs in the weights shown above, or the ones I use) and even sold SPX boxes to get rid of your negative cash balance to borrow cheaply. What to do now?

As the market rises, your equity will grow and your leverage (as a percent of the account) will drop. So it is vital you re-leverage further (borrow more against your bigger account) and buy more stocks to get back up to 2:1 leverage. If markets drop in value, you'll do the opposite: control your risk by selling some positions, paying off some of the debt, and bringing leverage back down. This is KEY towards avoiding actual deep, nearly-100% losses and to obtain the highest compound return. Just like boomers rebalance their 50/50 stock/bond Vanguard portfolios back to 50/50 if it gets out of line, so should you keep your portfolio at roughly 2:1 leverage. And no, it's not ""buying high, selling low"". You can't time the markets, so just stay disciplined and rebalance. This portfolio has the highest compound return **despite** having to sell somewhat during down markets. To minimize transaction costs and the cost of weekly whipsaws, I recommend you sell and decrease leverage if your leverage is higher than 2.2x, and buy more stocks by borrowing/re-leveraging back up if your leverage is lower than 1.8x. These are the **rebalancing bands**.

When you sell positions to deleverage, you would want to either keep the additional cash as collateral until the next SPX box expires, or just buy back a box. I recommend selling boxes in the near future (3-12 months) so you're always decently close to an expiring box, or a box so close to expiry that buying it back would entail very low spreads. BTW, when a box expires, you don't have to do anything. It is cash-settled automatically.

If you ever add money into this account, just invest it in such a way to get close to that 2:1 leverage. So if leverage was less than 2:1, you'd buy stocks with your added cash+more borrowing, if leverage was higher maybe you just keep it in cash/ST bond fund like ICSH/buy back a box spread. Play it by ear in your specific circumstance, just make sure your leverage stays within the rebalancing bands.

# Timing the Market

It is reasonable to let leverage rise a bit past 2.2x if markets are quite cheap because they've dropped in value (like in March 2020). It also is reasonable to let leverage drift down if markets are at ATHs (see my current portfolio is only about 1.75:1 leverage right now). The Kelly Criterion is clear that you'd want to leverage past 2:1 if the equity risk premium is abnormally high and vice-versa, so it makes sense. Don't do A LOT of that but a little bit of opportunistic market-timing (I call it ""delayed rebalancing"" when stocks are either real cheap or real expensive) is likely warranted.

# Looking Forward

No, you're not late to the party. Obviously, it would've been better to start a portfolio like this back in June 2020 when I first posted about it but hindsight is 20/20. This strategy does not require timing the markets; today is still a good time to start. Even today, stocks are decently priced, especially if using smart-beta. I expect this leveraged portfolio to have a return going forward of about 13% average annualized. Obviously, what you'll actually get short-term might be much more or much less but if you diligently stick to it, that would be the average return I expect. This is about three times as high as I expect for the very-expensive S&P500 (because of the 2:1 leverage, the international exposure and the smart beta vs the S&P 500 at a nosebleed valuation level of 37 Shiller CAPE 10).

# FAQs

\- Account minimum to start?

Ideally, you start with $100K (somewhat more is preferable to give you a cushion over the $100K barrier) and a portfolio margin account. Otherwise, you can just use regular margin and pay the slightly higher borrowing cost. I probably wouldn't bother if I had less than $20K, but if you have $50K or more, I'd say go for it.

\- What if I get margin called?

If you follow the strategy as you should (selling positions if losses mount, to pay back the debt and keep the leverage around 2:1) then you should never actually get to a position where your leverage is so high, your broker is liquidating you themselves. So you should never get an actual margin call.

\- What about using Leveraged ETFs (ex: SPUU)?

Those have high management fees, sometimes have too much leverage (ex: UPRO), will not let you diversify globally as effectively, there are no smart-beta options and they rebalance daily (instead of using the 1.8-2.2 leverage bands I recommend). IMO, it's better to rebalance a little less frequently than daily (this is what using bands accomplishes).

\- Where can I learn more about this? How did YOU learn it?

Unfortunately, I don't actually have a good resource for you. I've learned a lot about smart-beta, leverage, the Kelly Criterion and these topics to know what I'm doing here but it has been from a bunch of different sources. I hope this is enough to get you started though.

\- Why not more leverage for more returns?

Don't leverage more than this. Leveraging further leads to **overbetting (a condition where you're past the Kelly Criterion).** Any more leverage than that, and your portfolio risk goes up and your return goes down. Don't be a Bill Hwang and blow up with margin calls. Be disciplined, rebalance, keep leverage around 2:1, and let the portfolio do its magic.

\- Doesn't this only work during Bull markets?

This is the opposite of the above FAQ since it implies I'm using too much leverage. This is the theoretically highest compound returning portfolio **given** the risk of stocks (i.e. including both bear and bull markets). Obviously, in bull markets, it will perform amazingly (like now). And portfolios with even more leverage will be even better. During Bear markets, it will perform worse than not using leverage (and portfolios with more leverage will do far worse). Since I can't time the market or know when good or bad periods will come, I just use the optimal leverage a long-term portfolio would need for max returns. That's 2:1.

\- This sounds like the famous Hedgefundie UPRO/TMF portfolio no?

I personally think that portfolio has multiple problems (the LETFs themselves, the risk parity weights do not lead to max sharpe, even if it were max sharpe, I'm aiming for max compound growth not max Sharpe, and the leverage of 3x is just about past the Kelly Criterion). [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/gtwe5p4/?context=3) a chain of comments where I dig into the math I used to come to these personal conclusions.

\- Doesn't this lose money during Bear markets? If you use 2:1 leverage, shouldn't it have been wiped out during the GFC (stocks dropped more than 50% then)?

It loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for).

\- Can I do better if I add non-stock assets, or use dma200, or etc?

Probably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly. Ditto for any other strategy like dma200; if I felt confident about them, I would add them so if you do, then add them, that's totally fine!

\- Why do you only show returns since June?

Been doing this for a few years but only have computed data from Interactive Brokers since June. Before that, I used other brokers and it would be a pain to try to compute my personal overall returns. If you don't believe I got through Dec 2018 or March 2020, then I can't really do much for you. [Here's a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=5&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=2%3A1+Leveraged+S%26P+500&portfolioName2=S%26P+500&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=200&allocation1_2=100&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100) since 1985 showing it wouldn't have blown up, even during 2008, (though the drawdowns can be deep, again, there's risk!) and does outperform eventually as theory would say. 

\- Well, I invested in X stock and got much higher returns!

Good for you (srs)! If I knew what stocks to pick to make a lot of money, I would just do that. But I have no clue, so I'm just investing in a few sources of high risk/returns, diversify away all risk I don't get paid for and leverage to the maximum compound return.

\- This doesn't belong in WSBs, why are you posting it?

I thought a 2:1 smart-beta leveraged stock portfolio, funded with SPX boxes, would be the kind of portfolio WSBs would appreciate. If it's boring, I get it, I'll just post gain/loss porn from here on out any ways.

Ok, SPY is up 48% YTD.  So if I had $100k a year ago and leveraged 2:1, I could’ve bought $200k of SPY.  At a 48% return, I would’ve made $96,000, or a 96% annual return on my initial $100k.  Compared to your 108% annualized return, this isn’t too far off.

My question - how is your strategy that much different from “leverage at 2:1 into some good index funds”?

I am just a retard asking retarded questions, so I may have totally missed something, but please help me understand the best you can 🙏",
