Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Leaving out major events like COVID-19, it seems like at least twice a month on average there are rumors or stories circulating about the overall market.

Either there is a fear of a bubble, there's a fear of a correction, there are sell offs, now everyone is worried about bond yields. The market dips 1 percent and everyone starts worrying about a collapse. Then people worry about oil prices. Politics also come into play.

m85sp6,,stocks,post,1616116387,"List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doingI'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*

*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*

**Let's begin:**

1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..
2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.
3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.

&#x200B;

\--

Ok, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:

**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are ""undervalued"" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)

\-OR-

**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an ""investors"" path. This is a ""speculators"" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)

\--

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:

1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!
2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.
3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!
4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:

1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.
2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.
3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.
4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.

I hope this post will help some of you.

This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

If anyone needs to chat - by all means shoot me a note. Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.

__________  

Hey y'all. So I'm basically brand new to investing - I've dicked around on Robinhood before years ago, but never anything serious. I grew up in poverty and am only just finding my way out, so investment is still quite new but incredibly exciting to me.  

Yesterday, I took $500 and put it into the market. Here's what I bought. I plan on holding all pretty much until it's either time to retire or until daddy's gotta make a purchase. My logic behind choosing tickers was as follows:  

1) The index is too important to miss, and as I've said elsewhere, a 14% annual return over a lifetime feels much better than jumping off a cliff. **The indexes I chose are FTEC, QQQ, SCHA, SPY, VOO, VGT, and VUG.**   

2)Dividends are probably the most important aspect of a long term single stock hold IMO, closely followed by overall stability/growth projections. You don't need much inherent growth with dividend stocks, they just can't dip too far or else you're breaking even. Even if the stock itself stays even, you'll still compound your way ahead. **The dividend paying stocks I chose are AMCR, HBAN, HPE, KEY, PEP, T, and TM.** PEP and TM could arguably fall under other categories, but they both pay respectable dividends and are staple companies which will likely exist until the end of the current world, so they're on the list.    

-And finally, I chose one stock that I consider to be a knock off version of a growth stock. It has the growth potential, but it also has the dividend to boot, and really I'm looking at **TROW** and trying to find something wrong with the stock, but I can't. So TROW it is.  

To preemptively answer some questions:  

-I diversified within ETFs for two reasons; first, because it means more money overall within the indexes, and second because they'll all perform decently enough, but it's likely one or two might outperform the others, and I want in on those.  

-I chose AMCR because it's been rock steady for as long as the Earth has been round, and the dividend is unreal. I chose T for similar reasons, although T also falls under ""buy what you use"" in my case.  

-To me, HPE was the biggest ""risk"" in this portfolio, just because there's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that it will grow drastically from its current status. However, again, HPE isn't going anywhere any time soon, it's recovering somewhat decently from the pandemic crash, and the dividend is still there. As long as I don't lose ~15% or more on price over the long term, I should still be in good shape.  

So yeah. I sure feel like a monkey making and describing these decisions, but I wonder how bad or good these decisions actually are. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED talk.  

EDIT: In the brief time this has been up I've learned quite a bit more, which is honestly typical /r/stocks (thanks). What I'm learning is that I need to pay a little closer attention to what exactly each ETF follows, and that I possibly over-diversified. Apparently I'm still trading with technically unsettled funds, so once everything settles I'll look at making some corrective decisions. Thanks again.","['AMCR', 'TROW', 'HPE', 'PEP', 'HBAN']"

**Warning:** This is very long, but there's a TL;DR at the end

**Disclosure:** I bought 18 shares at $113.8 halfway through doing my DD. I plan to buy more if the price drops below $100.

I’m long-term bullish, but I’ll be trying to look at the negatives too. I’ll be going over Peloton’s background and future goals, its target market, competitors, financials, and where I see it going in the long-term.

First, here’s a very basic overview of the bull vs. bear arguments on this stock as I see them.

**Bull Hypothesis**: Peloton will be the future of connected fitness, essentially becoming the Netflix of the fitness world. It will dominate in the commercial gym and higher-income market as well as among fitness buffs, and it will also branch into the lower-income market/casual exercisers taking a section of that market share also.

**Bear Hypothesis:** Peloton’s stock price is grossly overhyped, and its PE ratio is unreal. This is a pandemic stock, and after we recover from the pandemic, it’s going to come crashing down to reality. Other big competitors such as Apple will undercut Peloton preventing it from dominating the market. Or, there will be so many competitors that no single company will gain significantly. Either way, Peloton can’t sustain these levels and will crash long-term.

Arguments for bullish stance:

1. At-home exercise has increased and will continue to increase thanks to the convenience and cheaper cost compared to a gym, and therefore, Peloton will continue to grow as a company over the coming years.

2. Covid will have more people going back to the gym gradually, but many will still be more cautious, and still others will have already bought into the at-home fitness system. Some will use a hybrid of gym and at-home workouts.

3. Peloton is looking to become established in gyms. If they are able to succeed in this, it would make people more likely to subscribe to their app personally as well.

4. The health and wellness industry is valued at 6,033.2 billion dollars, so there is plenty of room for growth for this stock. Peloton is branching out into apparel, and will likely also do nutritional products in the future. Subscriptions, apparel, and nutritional products are going to greatly increase revenue.

Arguments for bearish stance:

1. Peloton will not continue to grow after covid, or it will grow at a much slower level which will drop the stock value over the next 1-2 years. Right now the stock value is overblown and needs to be brought back down to a reasonable level based on its current financials.

2. People enjoy going to the gym and once covid is over, they will be happy to go back, and at-home fitness will stagnate.

&#x200B;

* **Peloton’s Background and Future Goals**

So, a quick overview. Peloton is an 8-year old company that founded the pairing of gym equipment with online workout classes. It started with a bike and cycling classes. The idea is that you buy the bike (fitted with a screen) and subscribe to a monthly membership that gives you access to livestream or recorded classes, allowing you to exercise at home. You can track things like your heart rate and compare your progress to others via the leaderboard. There’s also a community/social media element to it wherein you can follow other people to see their profile/workout progress, video chat with friends, send people virtual high-fives to support them, etc.

The CEO, John Foley, is a health nut who founded Peloton after he didn't want to fork out for a personal trainer. He found classes better, but as he got busier didn't have time to attend. That's how he came up with the concept.

The aim of Peloton is to create an online version of real-world gym classes without the hassle of going there or paying as much for the membership/fitness classes. Currently, Peloton is branching out into other gym equipment. They have brought out a treadmill, and in December 2020 they acquired a fitness equipment maker, Precor (one of the world’s largest suppliers of commercial equipment), indicating they plan to make a variety of equipment adapted to their concept. They also provide a subscription-only service which allows people on a budget to exercise without the expensive equipment, and they also provide classes that don’t need any equipment at all (e.g. yoga, body workouts).

&#x200B;

* **Target Market**

Peloton has started out aiming at a higher-income market as well as serious fitness buffs. According to the CEO, this is because they knew their equipment was too expensive to appeal to the average consumer. However, they do plan to branch out into the market of lower-income consumers as well as those who exercise on a more casual basis. They’ve started by creating their app-only subscription which doesn’t require equipment and is cheaper at $12.99/mo (the all-access membership on equipment is $39/mo). They are also working on making cheaper versions of their equipment.

Peloton is not only aiming to target at-home fitness users, but also to get its equipment in the commercial sector. This is where the real money could potentially be made. While at-home fitness is a more accessible market for competitors, whoever becomes the dominant system in the commercial sector is more likely to become the dominant system in general. The online community and content are going to be crucial for every company in this sector going forward since it will make or break whether more people wish to join up and stay within that community.

*What would be the benefits of the commercial sector?*

If Peloton becomes the established name in gyms and hotels, users will be able to access their own personal account and stats from anywhere in the world. On holiday? No problem, you can still continue your workout. Already joined a gym? That’s cool. You can still create an account for free on the gym equipment with access to the Peloton classes for that equipment. Maybe it’ll get you hooked. Maybe you’ll get your own subscription so you can access the other classes. Commercial Pelotons also give you the option of buying your very own Peloton equipment while you use it, so if you’ve never tried Peloton and discover you like the experience you can conveniently buy home equipment for yourself while you’re on it.

So, we see here that Peloton has a lot of potential, hence people’s excitement. At-home fitness was starting to gain ground before the pandemic, but of course the pandemic really made it rocket. This is an exciting growth sector, but like any business it comes with risk. One of the biggest risks is competitors, so let’s look at them next.

&#x200B;

* **Competitors**

There are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:

Apple Fitness +

iFit/NordicTrack

FIIT

&#x200B;

**Apple**

First, let’s tackle the behemoth – Apple. Apple brought out its Fitness + app in December 2020. It caused a bit of a stir since, let’s face it, it’s Apple. They have a fantastic track record of being innovative with excellent marketing, and as a company they have plenty of money and clout to invest into their product. They also already have a market share of ready-made consumers in the form of Apple product owners. Anyone who has an ipad, iPhone or Apple TV can start using it for a cheaper $9.99/mo.

In my opinion, there’s no doubt that Apple is going to get a share of the market, but the question is how large will that market share be, and is it really a threat to Peloton?

Currently, Android controls the mobile OS market with a 71.93% share.

Apple has 28.07% of market share on phones

26.4% of market share on tablets

2% market share on TVs (Apple TV)

Even if Apple manages to convince all of its current users to subscribe to Fitness+ (which would be fantastic for Apple), it still leaves a massive share of the market open for non-Apple users.

Also, an Apple Watch is required if you want to be able to track your workout progress in a similar way to Peloton. Otherwise you have to input your information manually. An Apple Watch is cheaper than buying Peloton equipment of course, but it does provide another obstacle for those wishing to have the whole experience. For everyday fitness users or those on a budget, something like FIIT or iFit will probably be more attractive.

Another very important factor is that Peloton subscriptions can also be used with Apple devices including the watch, so people can just as easily sign up for that although the monthly cost is slightly more expensive.

Apple certainly has its advantages, and I think if they invested in integrated gym equipment they could be a real contender against Peloton, but as it stands, it appears they are focusing on a content-only style, and are aiming at the more casual fitness user who don’t need top-notch. Using an Apple Watch and ipad with some other adaptable gym equipment is not going to allow for certain metrics in the same way you’re going to get with a Peloton. As a result, Apple has a much more basic leaderboard, less of a social community, and more basic metrics. This is fine for the everyday casual user, but Peloton is going to be preferable for those who take their fitness seriously, or who have the income to drop some extra money into a more expensive, but higher quality experience.

According to Ben Williams, global CXO of the innovation consulting agency [r/GA](https://www.reddit.com/r/GA/), who has worked with brands including Nike, Equinox, and SoulCycle on designing connected fitness products and services. *“Peloton is a little more on the performance end of the spectrum, and Apple’s more of an everyday fitness kind of audience. There are certainly users in the middle, especially among Peloton subscribers who don’t own the hardware; if Apple and Peloton butt heads, it’ll be over that group.""* ([https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes](https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes))

**FIIT**

FIIT is a UK-based app that is now available in 175 countries including the US. It does classes with and without equipment, as well as barre classes. It's £20/mo, although it's £10/mo if you get a yearly subscription. I couldn’t find the US pricing, but as of writing, £20 should be equivalent to approx. $28 and £10 approx. $14, so prices should be somewhere around there.

Fiit has lower barrier to entry since you can use it with any equipment, it comes with a heart rate chest strap, and it also syncs with Apple Watch and Fitbits. Like PTON it has a leaderboard and personal board to try and beat your own rankings. However, it is less detailed than PTON's leaderboard. Fiit also offers both live and recorded classes.

One downside for Fiit is it only plays on phones, so in order to watch Fiit classes on a TV, tablet, laptop, etc. you must manually connect it to your phone. This wouldn't be a big obstacle for people who are focused on budget over convenience, but might be for other parts of the market (e.g. those not technologically-minded or those who just want an easy setup). You can use it on the TV without a manual connection to your phone if you have SkyQ.

FIIT has some potential in the content-only sector, but it doesn’t appear to be competing in the equipment sector, so, like Apple, it is a competitor for the mid- to lower-income/casual fitness user market.

**iFit/NordicTrack**

Currently, this is the competitor I see as a bigger threat to Peloton. Unlike Apple and FIIT, iFit does pair with NordicTrack gym equipment. NordicTrack is a bit cheaper than Peloton bikes, and they come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).

While NordicTrack is currently focusing on at-home equipment and not commercial equipment, it could draw some of the less-tapped mid-range market (e.g. fitness buffs on a budget and more casual fitness users with a mid-range income). Then there’s the threat that it moves into the commercial market later.

Some other pluses for iFit are –

It uses terrain mapping data drawn from Google Maps API to emulate i

1. Its terrain mapping system. *(""iFit uses terrain mapping data drawn from the Google Maps API to emulate the inclines and declines of the map you've drawn, and it also pulls scenery from Google Street View so you can see where you're biking. Maybe you don't need to go outside during quarantine after all. "")*

2. It has a faster repair service than Peloton at this time. Customers of iFit report that repairs take a week with Nordictrack vs weeks with Peloton.

You can read about Peloton vs. iFit here ([https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack)).

iFit/NordicTrack are trailing behind Peloton at the moment with regards to brand awareness and spreading its product. Whether or not it can catch up is going to depend on its marketing skills over the next few years. However, while it’s possible it could gain some market share for the commercial sector, it will have a tough time beating Peloton as market leader, and I believe it will not be doing so for the high-income sector since its focus is on appealing to the low to mid-income sector by making their product more affordable. Peloton has achieved a cult status, and much like designer goods, that can make it more desirable even (or especially) for lower incomes, whereas being initially seen as the more “affordable option” makes it harder to rank up.

So, while I expect NordicTrack to take some decent market share in future, I think there is more than enough of the fitness industry market to go around, and it will not hinder Peloton’s growth in any significant way over the next couple of years.

&#x200B;

* **Financials**

Ok, so that’s competitors. Let’s look at financials.

Peloton doesn't have a long history yet, and the pandemic obviously gave them a boost, so financials will only take us so far here. So far, their financials have seen a significant increase though net income amount is quite small in comparison to revenue.

We saw a 104.4% increase in revenue from September 2019 - December 2019 before the pandemic had emerged on the world stage and been seen as an issue. The net income, however, did decrease by 5 million and operating income decreased by 11 million.

This appears to be due to an increased amount of investment in R&D. By Q1 (March 2020), operating/net income increased slightly despite R&D expenses also increasing, which is a good sign imo. In Q2 (June 2020), the company was well into the green and R&D expenses dropped significantly, increasing again in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. This on top of increased S&G expenses seems to have reduced their general operating profit although it is still firmly in the green (59 million operating income as of Dec. 2020).

I've taken the year from Dec. 2019 - Dec. 2020 as measurement of the company's financial health since from Dec. 2019 shows a small slice of its progress pre-pandemic after the initial furore of going public.

· Revenue increased 99.55% (-446m to 1065m).

· Net income increased 216.4% (-55m to 64m).

· Operating income increased 195.2% (-62m to 59m)

· Operating expenses increased 41.3% (259m to 366m)

· R&D Expenses increases 128.6% (21m to 48m)

As we can see, operating expenses have increased much less in relation to the revenue/income. R&D expenses, while having a high percentage increase, are acceptable to me since it is a growing company, it is not putting it in the red financially, and it's a reinvestment into the company's growth.

Debt has slowly but steadily increased per quarter also. Net debt is currently at -619 mil. If PTON were to continue at a growth of debt of 59mil per quarter (as was reported last quarter) it would take 10 years to pay off. However, taking into account that it is currently in growth phase I'd expect PTON to increase their net income within 2 years (thanks to their subscription service), hopefully putting it at a steadier pay-off phase.

Retained earnings showed a dip in Dec. 2019 and Mar. 2020 after IPO, but is steadily increasing (albeit still heavily in the red). As of Dec. 2020 retained earnings are -561 mil. This does hold risk, but I'm personally positive on their growth and am giving allowance for their reinvestment and growth at this early point.

It's not good for shareholders at this point though as there is a lot of uncertainty over whether Peloton can maintain the level of growth that they had during the pandemic. I am of the opinion, that while they might not maintain the same level of growth, they are still going to grow considerably, especially over 2021 when many of us are still locked into the pandemic. Also, looking at their financials, they were heading in the right direction pre-pandemic. The fact that they were given a boost in 2020 is a bonus. If they can continue to maintain their ratio of income to operating expenses, which they have been doing so far, then they’re in a strong financial position imo.

Added to that, they have spread into Australia and have plans to spread into Asia, so providing this goes successfully, their income overall should only increase.

* **Fundamentals**

You can check out the fundamentals in this article - [https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/](https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/)

I haven’t studied fundamental analysis yet, so I’m relying on the experts for this information. As far as I can tell it seems pretty positive.

&#x200B;

* **Management**

First here’s some background on the leaders.

The founder John Foley is a health nut who came up with the concept. He’s described as a jack-of-all-trades having worked software, hardware, e-commerce, content production, marketing and gyms. He went to Harvard Business School, and is the founder of pronto.com and proust.com which, by the looks of it, didn’t succeed. He was also the president of eCommerce at Barnes & Noble. As founder of Peloton, he says he emphasises a focus on approachability – not having the hierarchical approach where the big bosses are lording it over the rest of the employees.

The current Peloton president was ex-CEO of Barnes & Noble which oversaw the launch of Nook. He resigned due to poor sales, though both he and Foley state that it couldn't win anyway since they were too late to the game behind Amazon. He was also a co-founder of gifts.com, and was Executive Vice President of Marketing and General Manager of [HSN.com](http://hsn.com/) He also served as VP for HSN, running the growing HSN.com e-commerce site. From 2000-2004, Lynch was vice president and general manager of e-commerce, for Palm Inc., where he oversaw Palm's Web properties. His earlier career included brand management positions at Seagram Universal and Guinness.

Peloton has generally high reviews (4-4.5 stars on websites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Peloton-Interactive-Reviews-E734449.htm) and [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Peloton/reviews)). It’s reported to have excellent employee benefits such as a no-vacation policy (people can take time off whenever they like for as long as they choose), 401k, medical and dental, college loan down payments, as well as child care and mental health telemedicine services. Another positive point to note is that on Glassdoor, one of the approval points (most voted for) is that people approve of the CEO.

I checked out the negative reviews, and a lot of them complain about a clique-y culture amongst staff, as well as disorganized or unfriendly management (often playing favourites). Most of these complaints seem to be in the lower-tier jobs of assembly/retail.

&#x200B;

* **Price Target/Conclusion**

Although I think Peloton will be volatile as lockdowns end and potentially go down for the short-term, I believe Peloton will do well long-term.

The difficulty right now is in how disconnected the share price is from the actual value, and deciding if it will, as the bears say, crash down to reality (aka a price that more accurately reflects its financials). In this area, it’s mainly speculation as far as I can tell, since growth stocks are held up by belief in the future of the company. This means a lot of the tangible growth may already be price in.

PTON’s LTM PE ratio is currently 190.9 x at time of writing which is ridiculously high, but with the expected growth in revenue is forecast to make it a PE ratio of 4.3 x in the next 12 months.

While I’m very leery of the fact that the stock is so disconnected from its underlying value at this point, the P/CF ratio and future forecasts put me more at ease. I think it’s still a riskier stock so I don’t plan to invest heavily, but I’m of the belief it will adjust long-term.

Analysts are expecting PTON to double its revenue over 2021, which, providing they maintain their same consistency in expenses, would put them at approx. $1.2 billion in net income. Compare this to 2019 when it was at $-53 million.

It’s difficult to compare this stock to others since it’s a leader in a new market niche. However, if we compare it to Netflix (a similar leader and disruptor) which has a net income of $2.76 billion and a current share price of approx. $530 per share, half that would have PTON around the $200 - $260 mark. Another point of note for me is that PTON accurately forecast there would be 4 million members out there in 2017, which it has now gained. Now the company is forecasting 100 million PTON members out of the 200 million gym goers. This would be a massive gain although, of course, it would take several years. [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/peloton-commercial-at-ces/)

At the moment, Netflix has 203.67 million subscribers. If Peloton could eventually get even half of the amount it is forecasting, it would put its share price in excellent standing.

As a pessimist, I don't think it will reach $200+ in 2021 with a $1.2 billion income since PTON is a different business model, has a different product, and other financials vary. Also, due to fears about the ending pandemic, overhype and competitors, it may progress more slowly and volatilely.

I’m conservative about Peloton’s optimism of gaining half the market, but I’m overall bullish for their future. I’m of the opinion that, while Peloton may drop in the short-term due to FUD, I think it will do well if held over 2021 so I see these next few weeks and months as a buying opportunity. I have a price target of between $200-$300 within the next 2-3 years. If it goes higher, great. Analysts seem to support the bullish view – many of them putting price targets of $130 - $200 (I think that’s the max) for 2021.

I consider Peloton a buy now, although personally I’d like it to go a bit lower before buying more since I think short-term FUD has the chance of bringing it down a bit further, and also because I’m a newbie at this and it’s a volatile stock. If it goes sub-100 at any point, I consider it a moderate to strong buy, and if it goes sub-90 I consider it a very strong buy. I myself, will not be putting a large amount into it, but I may add a few more shares to my position gradually as it falls (if it continues to fall). All this uncertainty over the pandemic ending seems like an excellent entry point for PTON.

**\[Note:** *While I was writing this DD, news also broke about a child dying due to one of the treadmills. Of course, this is a terrible thing to have happened to the family, and I feel bad to have to talk about it in terms of what it may do to the stock, but sadly that’s part and parcel of DD.*

*There are not details at time of writing as to how this child died. It is listed in Peloton equipment instructions for children and pets not to be near the equipment, and there is even a safety key that is to be removed when not using the equipment. I personally do not blame Peloton for it. Sadly, treadmill deaths, while rare (3 deaths per year on average), have happened with other companies in the past, but there’s no denying it’s a terrible loss for the family and that Peloton will also likely pay for it in terms of bad PR and a possible lawsuit. They may also need to begin work on making their products more child-friendly although I’m unsure if that will be required since they’re stated as only being for users 16+.*

*Stock has already fallen upon the news, and I won’t be surprised if it drops more between this incident and the general FUD. In my opinion, the next few weeks/months may be quite negative for PTON until they are able to restore trust with consistent earnings, but I still hold to them being a good long-term investment*.**\]**

Anyway, I hope this DD helped someone, and if you have any constructive criticism or advice I’d love to hear it. This was a slog for me since I’m learning as I go, but I enjoyed it. I’ll be practicing DD on other stocks in future so that I can “git gud”. I plan to study renewable energy next, so that may be my next post (providing this post doesn’t get downvoted to hell lol).

**TL;DR:** PTON stock go up, but maybe fall for short-term (Weeks? Months?) Current FUD = Good entry point. PTON be higher end of 2021. PT around $160 EOY, PT $200-300 in 2022-2023.","['GOOGL', 'TGT', 'NKE', 'AMZN', 'CF', 'AAPL', 'MO', 'NFLX', 'BEN']"

m8g5f8,grh9275,stocks,comment,1616161377,"Solid DD and I'll add a couple of things.  I'm a convert myself - 9 months ago I thought PTON was just another BYND, but I've come around to really believing in the bull thesis.

1) The valuation actually isn't that bad.  The company is still in the growth phase so using earnings multiples is unfair.  On an EV/sales metric, we're looking at trailing EV/sales of 18 and forward EV/sales of only 9.  While they aren't direct competitors, just for reference you can compare those numbers to other growth stocks like ROKU (25/17 respectively) or ETSY (16/12) or DKNG (40/26) etc.

2) The one thing missing from your DD, and the major differentiator between PTON and any other competitor, is the brand value.  I'm not a PTON customer myself, but every person I've spoke to is absolutely in love with it.  Peloton has a cult following, not because of the hardware, but because of the content.  Their instructors are fitness celebrities and people love being part of the community.  Competitors can easily recreate the hardware but copying the content and cult factor is much, much more difficult.  In this regard Peloton is like Tesla, Lululemon, or Apple (at least in the earlier days).","['TSLA', 'ETSY', 'AAPL']"
m8g5f8,grh3ryh,stocks,comment,1616158427,"Super job for your first DD! Well written and good understanding of key drivers. 

One idea is also to look into what analysts are saying about the stock (to see if maybe they have some additional thoughts to add to your analysis) and it’s also good to have an idea of their price targets for context. 

Another is to actually make a DCF. E.g what kind of revenue growth, margins, etc do you need to reach your expected price targets?

Peers are of course the best to compare with, not sure if Netflix is the best example. They operate in different industries, have different margins, and are at different levels in the business cycle. But I understand it may be difficult in some cases.

Good luck!",['NFLX']

You also missed that on youtube there are a ton of content makers who hope to get subscribers by offering free live classes like the ones PTON is charging for.

Most importantly i think you haven’t mentioned anything about the recent “cancel and reorder” nonsense new users have complained about on social media. Making so many people re-order causes normal people to question PTON’s customer service, but savvy investors see that and wonder if what really happened is PTON trying to count sales twice by having people re-order instead of just changing the earlier order.

m8odr7,,stocks,post,1616180418,"A Quick Read - Is your stock in the red?Hey everyone!!

Happy Friday! We’re halfway thru the month of March! Crazy, don’t you say?! 

The Techy-Wrecky is back again with the 10 year treasury yield up.. *woo-hoo* ... 

This means tech stocks are takin a *BEATING!*

You’re seeing red in your portfolio??

Well let’s go back to the first day you bought this stock... why on earth did you buy this stock? Do you believe in the company and its fundamentals, and growth in the long-term? ... or was it for some quick cash, the race to get rich quick..? 

The stock market always will have a good day, and a bad day.. literally like life - there’s good days, and bad days... in the end, all should be OK if you bought into a well established company... *yes, I know anything can happen at any given time* ...

Let’s say I bought Apple Stock. *I did, but lets take it for an example* ....

I purchased this for $137 usd , and it is now $120-125 range.... 

Should you sell??

The company hasn’t changed anything towards it, it’s just that these treasury yields are up... 

So it’s more of a buying opportunity to “buy the dip” . *This isn’t Financial Advice. Do your own DD, your capital is at risk.* 

First and foremost, lets take a look at this all..

—- Keep in mind , this is a long-ish read... read however much you want, comment if you want, or simply view it. — Plus , thank you for taking your time to read this! —- 

———- ••• ———— ••• ———— •• ——- • ———-

#The Mindset

1) We procrastinate buying certain stock at (x) price... so we go “we’ll buy that when its lower” WHILE HAVIN A PLAN, and doing research... 

2) We see it rise up and suddenly we think we have “missed out” — *FOMO* ...

3) a) It either rises up more, and more, and more... 

b) It rises up, tumbles all the way back down, and we freak out...

4) a) We can take our profits if we wish

b) We start worrying *oh my goodness, I’m losing money* ... and sometimes results in us selling stock.

*or*

1) We see a stock in an article , “this stock will make you ____ dollars in ____ years” or Jimmy Joe suggests “BUY THIS STOCK” 

2) You see stock, buy stock... NO PLAN, NO GOAL, blindfolded buying the stock... 

3) You see it go up ? Wow, you might’ve gotten lucky! *First ones free!* .... or you see it go down??

4) You say **F^ck JIMMY JOE!!** as he made you lose ____ dollars as you were holding ___ shares.... little do you know, Jimmy Joe has a plan of ____ years, ____ price target, and sees the full potential. 

———————-

**DO YOU NOTICE THAT?**

Why are you buying into a company YOU BELIEVE IN for a “good price” to you, and selling it off for less? 

It’s sheer utter panic.. “I’m losing money!! I have to sell!” 

... it’s not a loss until you sell it !!! 

It’s like buying a new house you fully renovated for 500k ... and selling it for 475k to a family friend ... or buying something new - literally anything - and selling it for cheaper... even though the stock is always “new” !!! 

———— ••• ————- ••• ———— 

#How to manage seeing red - a loss

**Please feel free to add whatever tips you have yourself down in the bottom, but I will list some of mine.** 

1) If you have high hopes, aren’t in need of money, you can let it slide... a bad day in the stock market will happen time to time. - it will always create buying opportunities, and good selling opportunities if you are patient. — **Only put money in you can afford to lose** — with certain stocks, or just in general. The Stock Market is no “Game” whatsoever, and viewing it this way can create an addiction.. 

2) **SET A STOP LOSS** - this should be number 1, but I will leave it as number 2. Why? Because if you are a long term investor, sometimes not having stop loss is your friend... imagine if your stop loss kicked in during March last year.... *the gold mine opportunity* ... you would have lost a LOT of money... and I’m sure everyone did during that time period... if you want a risky investment that you’re unsure of, don’t really know ... sure, a stop loss is great! It will allow you to buy stock of a company you actually really like.

3) Exercise. Walk around for a bit, do yoga, a workout, play Wii Fit , meditate... whatever to help your mind off the stress of “losing” money..  —- also helps by not even looking at your Trading App... do whatever else, do nothing if you really want!! Its okay to let your money work its on powers.... relax.. calm down! You are INVESTING or TRADING! You started a position in something you like which is better than none - and regretting it - and started trading/investing in the first place... which is REALLY beneficial in the long run!! — You just have to wait and see! 

4) Jot down the day, and price the stock reached on its low... sounds ridiculous, right? Not overly... if you do this with a stock, you will see that you can take a hard hit of a negative number... and its progression back up to where it regained... - do this with some of your favourite stocks, and you can see for yourself where a stock price remains as a “buy” for you and a “sell” for you... 

5) Know that everyone is losing money. Yes, you’re allowed to think of yourself, everyone has different capitals , risk tolerance, etc., ... but know it is not just you.. and we all are either losing a ton of money... or gaining... 

6) Last one - If you don’t believe in that company no longer, don’t like its fundamentals / something about it, need money, and “its a bust” because it hasn’t moved? Maybe that is when you should sell for a loss..

———————— •••• —————- •••• ——————

We all want to make money. We all want some profits from our stocks, but suddenly when we start putting our emotions into the stock market... it sometimes wins... and we sell low, and buy high... and lose a ton of money doing so... 

That won’t make you rich... it will give you a lesson that **sometimes** if you’re not patient enough, you will miss out on great opportunities.  

— But also, don’t be greedy. Greed will win over, and that stock will plummet, and you’ll be regretting yourself. Treat yourself to some profits... its OKAY to take profits!! 

Everyone makes mistakes in the market.

**OVERALL** - Stocks !! Stocks last FOREVER! even after you die!!! So if you buy something, see it a low? Replace your emotions, think positive... *I believe in this stock, this stock can reach my stock price of ____ and I will sell (x) shares* .... — ALWAYS, ALWAYS, have a PLAN when buying a stock!! 

What is your goal? .. and go after it! If you no longer believe in the company, something changes thats bad / you don’t like, sure! Cut them losses, or take those profits while you can!! Put it in something you believe in - or a well established company (blue chip) or simply an ETF... and life is good!! 

——— ••• ——— •• ——- •• ——— •• 

All in all, 

The stock market is a rollercoaster of emotions. People buy when they think its a good price to buy in, while others think its a good time to sell.... you have your plan... you stick to that plan... and everything should be okay! 

Happy Friday, everyone! 

Stock Market closes in an hour ... (not including after market) ... time to relax afterwards for the weekend!!

What are your guys’ plans? Let me know, down below!!

... and feel free to criticize, give feedback, and any other tips to help out others while seeing a loss! If there’s anything I missed, feel free to add that in, as well!!

Take care,

Hope all is going well!! Today is a GOOD DAY! What did you buy today?! Let me know down below! 

Sending positive vibes your way.

Stay safe, and as always

Happy Trading / Investing!

m8l7nj,,stocks,post,1616171773,"DD on UUUU or 'Energy Fuels'Don't know if this falls under rule 7, my apologies if it does.

Before I go on, everything you'll want to know is in this webcast from yesterday (second post titled 'Energy Fuels Strives to Return REE Production to the United States as Demand Grows): [https://news.networknewsaudio.com/](https://news.networknewsaudio.com/)

I'll keep it short:

Catalysts:

\- the US wants to remove its dependence on China for rare earths. it wants a supply chain that does not require China for processing, separation, etc. of rare earth metals

\- climate change has made the environmental left take a second look at uranium, and people on the left are now supporting nuclear energy as the most powerful carbon-free source of energy

\- energy needs are set to grow rapidly over the next two decades just as many uranium mines are shutting down, resulting in an impending supply crunch.

\- due to renewed interest in uranium, U companies have restarted purchasing in the spot market, which led to the largest single-day rise in some time just a few days ago: [https://numerco.com/NSet/](https://numerco.com/NSet/)

UUUU:

1. First, as a comparable, MP Materials is the biggest rare earths miner in the US/North America. They had great earnings yesterday, have a share price in the \~$43 range, and a market cap of about $5-6B. They mine bastnaesite and still ship their rare earths to China for processing.
2. UUUU, a year ago, embarked on a program to process rare earths of its own. They are not a rare earths miner. They contractually purchase (2500 tons as of right now) monazite ore from Chemours, from Chemours' mine in Georgia. They separate uranium from the monazite ore, then send it to Neo Performance Materials in Estonia, Europe, for the final stage of processing.
3. Monazite ore is richer in rare earths.

||Monazite|Bastnaesite|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Neodymium Praseodymium (NdPr)|22.6%|16.3%|
|Samarium Europium Gadolinium (SEG)|14.4%|1.1%|

4. UUUU's rare earths value chain is completely non-China, where MP's still goes through China.

5. As of now, MP produces significant quantities of rare earths, while UUUU is at the beginning.

6. MP cannot mine the richer monazite, as it contains radioactive uranium.

7. Price action: after significant run-ups recently, UUUU has taken a breather. It's dipped low.

8. UUUU is currently an $800-900m market cap with share price in the $6-7 range.

Conclusion: UUUU's current share price is massively undervalued. While MP currently produces significant rare earths, UUUU's impending production (up to 15,000 tons per year, equal to 50% of US rare earth demand) will be both higher quality and non-China. Putting together the superior REE play, plus its participation in the broader Uranium bull cycle, in my view, the price has significant upside.

See r/UraniumSqueeze community for more (it is not actually a squeeze community, the discussions are 100% real and good).

Who is their customer and what is their product?

RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services?  Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.

Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.

Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?

Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?

Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership?  Seeking responsibility for your actions.  This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.

&#x200B;

Since the sheet is impossible to get into these days with so much traffic (unless you're the lucky 50 - 60 that seem to get in) I thought I'd send screen shots of the pertinent info. If this seems like something everyone is interested in I'll keep it up. 

&#x200B;

Positions: [Here are the stocks I bought yesterday using this method.](https://imgur.com/gallery/oWLoqnj) If I had bought at the end of the day rather than getting impatient and buying around noon I'd be up a LOT more than this

&#x200B;

Today's data isn't really changing anything:

1. Reddit is still the best category
2. The score grouping of 500 is the most successful, with 250 being the next
3. Holding past the average **% to Max** date starts losing money, so sell quickly
4. The average number of days from the day it pops up on the list to max profit is 6 days (the 500 category is showing a REF error but I looked at the data and it's about 6 days)
5. The average % return you should expect is 15.81% - 17.70%. Because that's an average I usually start considering selling once it hits 10%

&#x200B;

Using the above criteria I did what I always do: 

1. Filter it down to those items, highlight the ones in the 500 category, then start searching Reddit for every ticker. 
2. I filter all posts by New so that I can see what the most recent conversation is.
3. I filter out any obvious bots or 1 person spamming multiple subs
4. I make a note of any ticker that is being discussed in at least 4 different subs. Extra points if there is a decent amount of conversation
5. From there I narrow it down to about 3 - 5 stocks that just *feel* good to me then spread my money out on all of them
6. Then I sit and wait until 10% - 15% or 6 days, whichever comes first

m8ghu0,,stocks,post,1616158090,"SEC Pattern Day Trading Rules (Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts)SEC PATTERN DAY TRADER RULES

Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts

Cash accounts have unlimited day trading, but cannot trade with ""unsettled funds"", which require ""T+2"" (trade day, plus two more days) to become useable again. Brokerages will always use your settled funds first. You will be flagged for a ""good faith violation"" if you buy and sell a stock on the same day, but only if that stock was purchased with unsettled funds (proceeds gained from selling another stock that same day that did not sit for two days after purchasing it). If the stock is more than three days old, then when you sell it, the funds are settled immediately, and ready to use right away.

So to be clear : with a cash account, you can always buy and sell the stock same day, no matter what, but at a slight penalty to your operational liquidity. Account restrictions will be imposed for 90 days on the second good faith violation occurence using unsettled funds (no time limit). On the third violation, you are permanently branded with the PDT (Pattern Day Trader) label. They will not physically stop you from buying with unsettled funds until these restrictions are already triggered. It is up to you to keep up with it. Many times, you will not be notified in a timely manor, and will discover your account locked at the worst possible time.

The margin system was actually created as an end around loophole to the T+2 system (used to be T+3). It was created as instant micro loans to allow people to use their stocks as collateral while settling. But times have changed. In this age of instant everything, where buy and sell orders are not hand written, mailed, or over wire service, it really is preposterous that we do not have instant settled funds, just like we would at our bank, online, or at a casino/dog track.

Solutions :

Use two or three brokerages to spread out your day trades, thus avoiding the ""three strikes in one week"" PDT label and limitations at any one brokerage.

...or...

Only use one third of your money on any given day, on a rotating basis, at one brokerage, same result.

...or...

Get your account balance over $25,000 by any means necessary, then the PDT label will be meaningless, and will become your badge of honor.",

m8l2dq,,stocks,post,1616171350,"Thoughts on Mortgage Securities & Real Estate?With interest rates so low many homebuyers are buying at prices wayyy over asking price. This leads me to believe there is going to be a bubble burst soon, especially when eviction & foreclosure moratoriums end. How likely is it that there is an upcoming dip? I’m still learning about stocks and economics, so from a beginners point of view I see a bubble. I’m I wrong in making this guess?

Ideally I would plan to buy when the market drops and then sell a few years later when it becomes stable again and growth looks on par with a healthy economy.

I’ve been investing casually since last spring and got “lucky” I that I bought during the major dip in March. My thought is that I’d like to “recreate” the gains I saw in the last year by taking advantage of a potential market crash.",

That should have given me the first clue something was strange.Then my better half lost her high paying job to a buyout. But this is different. Some people will surely lose their property.

So you are continuing to walk at that pace until you slip on a rock and now you fall 5 steps back and your friend is there to catch you. That is how a trailing stop works.

Are you suggesting that it is stupid to sell on bad news because if nobody sold the price would stay the same? Although technically true, good luck coordinating with the entire market. If people think the price is going to drop, there are always going to be sellers. 

&#x200B;

> Also what makes it really stupid is that when someone is selling because of bad news someone else is buying the same bad news! 

Why is this stupid? Of course a sale has to have a buyer, but prices don't drop from sales alone. You could just as easily reverse your comment and say that every buyer has to have a seller on the way up. So, by the same logic it would be stupid to sell on the way up. Ultimately, nobody knows which way it is going, so mistakes are only known in hindsight.

Prices don't fall from sales or purchases alone, they change when the pressure of one exceeds the other. If bad news comes out, nobody is going to want to buy at current prices, so naturally bids are going to fall. If anyone wants to sell, which they always will, the asking price will fall if there aren't enough buyers.

Similarly, the amount that a stock falls on bad news isn't just based on the willingness to sell, it is the willingness to buy. If people want to buy it at the current price, it won't fall. It falls because there are more people that want to sell than there are buyers at a current price.",

we can use the pandemic as an example:

Looking naively at the unemployment charts, last spring we spiked with shutdowns all the way to a crazy 14+%. then immediately started trending downward to now  about 6.9%. obviously not great but huge improvement. This figures point to a bad economy...

but then go take a look at tax revenues for 2020. they are up from 2019, actually up quite a bit, almost $300 billion nationwide. 2019 had 4% unemployment while the majority of 2020 ranged from basically 7% to 14%... how does that sync?

The WHO. only certain sectors absorbed the brunt of the unemployment, namely travel, some retail and food service. 

Aggregate numbers don't tell the story of how millions of good paying jobs kept on. they adapted and figure out how to work from home. It doesn't tell the story about how the pandemic opened new markets and exploded other sectors while some faltered.

m8n3t1,,stocks,post,1616176901,"ZKIN 15m OutlookJust to give you an idea, ZKIN today's trading volume in $ is bigger than:

- Walmart
- Starbucks
- McDonalds
- Ford Motors
- Coca Cola
- Twitter 
- Adobe
- All major Covid vaccination companies such as Pfizer, Moderna etc.
-

Since the last 15m Outlook the price gain almost 40% in value as it's currently being traded above $12 per share. To be exact $12.26 now.

The price of ZKIN is in a strong short term uptrend as the price continues to find support and bounce from 20 EMA.

If we look for this trend to continue, the price can't fall below 20 EMA with a full candle body. So a drop below $12 will bring the price to $11.

But if this trend continues, the next buying wave, trend of higher highs would be located at somewhere $14.50 with a spike up to $15.00 per share.

Unfortunately RSI has posted an exaggerated bearish divergence, which led to a correction that we are currently seeing. This is nothing too bad is it's only a correction sign, not a trend changing one. However RSI is below 60, meaning that bullish momentum isn't present. Still the trend of higher lows is present, mixed signals from RSI.

MACD has started a corrective wave while corrective volume is increasing.

Current support is located at $12 and $11 per share.

Current resistance is at $13, $14 and $14.5 per share.","['PFE', 'ADBE', 'WMT', 'SBUX', 'TWTR']"
m81rlu,,stocks,post,1616104517,"Where are those who were around for the 2008 ""crash"" and do you remember the recovery sentiment?I do not claim to be a bear or a bull in this market. I am just along for the ride but some of the feel I get from the media and the public remind me a lot of the 2008 crisis. Well more so the recovery from the crisis. I was probably the age of the average reddit user trading today when it happened. FYI it was much harder to get into trading (and expensive) back then... make sure to appreciate the time you are living in! 

What I remember was that when the fed stepped in and started handing out money everyone was dropping the word ""hyperinflation."" It was the first time I had heard of it and I had to figure out what it meant.

They also cut interest rates in half and the theme was ""it is only a matter of time before they came back."" I bought a house in 2011 and my loan officer was pushing me to hurry before interest rates went higher. 

They started this ""quantitative easing"" for the stock market where the government dumped money in so it would move up ""artificially."" This is how it was explained to me at the time and why people started talking about the bubble building that was going to ""pop"" in the stock market as it recovered to it's ""pre-crisis"" levels. 

When I think back to the ""sentiment"" of the financial crisis I see a lot of the same things today but it is all compressed into a much shorter time frame now. It also has this ""double down"" feel. Interest rates didn't ever recover and were cut in half yet again during the covid crisis. The fed is printing far more money then they did back then (though the bail outs were huge). I don't think they ever really stopped (someone else can clarify) injecting money into the economy. I also would like to note that inflation didn't ""get out of control"" but it sure seems things are much more expensive even though the numbers they follow don't show that. 

TL;DR These are the things that come to my mind from watching CNBC everyday after work during the financial crisis. The worries of then seem to be similar to the worries of today but they didn't actually play out back then. At the same time it seems we never got ""back to where we were"" when you consider the fed's involvement after 2009. They seem to be perpetually stuck injecting money and keeping rates low. Whenever they try to step away the market throws a tantrum and they come back. Can anyone else make some comparisons as to how this time is different or possibly the same? 

Bonus Question: Are any signs of a weak economy always going to be the responsibility of the fed to fix it? (More in reference to 2018-2019 than the covid crash.)",
m81rlu,greyak4,stocks,comment,1616105708,"I had just started investing right before the crash. 

At the bottom the market was down, I guess, like 60%. And people still thought it could go lower. I personally know people that sold in early 2009, just before the bottom and didn't get back in till several years later. Some never got back in at all.  

On the way up there was talk about v shaped recoveries and how it's not possible (which I've found to be a recurring theme). Basically the entire ride up, people were calling for corrections, having the big crash pretty fresh in their minds: 2010, 2013, 2015 - I remember this being a particularly strong sentiment in these years. 

As for myself. I did terribly. Jumping in and out of stocks on the way down. Then when we had a sharp recovery, I remember getting into short etfs. I didn't really find my footing till around 2011. 

It was a crazy time to be invested. I learned a lot of (thankfully cheap) lessons.",
m81rlu,greykfr,stocks,comment,1616105838,"Hm, I remember the talk about there basically being a «credit squeeze». Security through «junk» loans got called out as the rotten shit they were. Resulting in credit drying up or getting expensive. Essentially nobody wanted to loan out to another enterprise, general distrust. I remember interest rates on house loans skyrocketet. If you owner a business, you probably had a bad time financially. Laying staff off or saving where you could, postponing new investments.

Stocks plummeted. Ah, the bargaigns you could do at the time....

In come the central banks across the world. Promising to fix things to keep interest low, so that no companies that shouldn’t have to fail would fail, and nobody would lose their house due to crazy interest. Printing money and taking over junk bonds, bailing out those «too big to fail».

Stock recovered in like 2-3 years. 

And, somehow...they just continued to keep the rates low the next 12 years. Trying to ease back just as covid hit. Or so they said. Always seemed to be another excuse to keep the interest low.

2008-2009 was caused by an all out free for all in the housing and financial markets. People were taking mortgages they couldn't afford, with literally no jobs and no assets, and sometimes even 2 or 3 mortgages. Those mortgages were bundled together and sold as AAA investments, along with derivatives and derivatives of derivatives of those investments. Then insurance companies sold insurance against those investments that anyone could buy. The whole thing was a house of cards.  
  
Anyways, my point is, we aren't living in 2008. Sure there are probably pockets of bubbles, but the broader market is stable at the moment. People are overreacting about inflation right now. We will see some inflation, but we haven't seen hyperinflation since the 70s. And the fed has learned a lot since then and since the GFC.",

m8k98t,grhqnqe,stocks,comment,1616169643,"Generally the wash sales work themselves out.   It can get strange depending on if your shares are all together or if you’re selling and buying the shares at different price points depending on your share management.   Eventually if you sell all your positions and wait 61 days then the math should work out.   

For example if you’re using fifo management of shares, and you buy 100@$10 then average down by buying another 100@$5, your cost basis would be $7.50 per share for your holdings.   If the stock rises to $7.50 and you sell half, the first shares you bought would be sold in fifo management meaning you’d show a loss of $250 on the sale, but your remaining position would be comprised of shares with a cost basis of $5, showing a gain of $250 in your current holding.

If your shares are set to LIFO then you’d realize the gain of $250 and your remaining position would show a loss of $250 or a share cost basis of $10.

Obviously it gets more complex than this the more you trade various costs and lot sizes, but at the end of the day when you close your position and wait for 61 days it all balances out.  If you’re planning to hold long term then it can be advantageous for taxes to pick the shares you want to sell in a given year to either realize a gain or loss in the year.

m80afu,,stocks,post,1616100371,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks. Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Of course I haven’t written this piece, copied from SAXO BANK platform. 

I tried to post the 3 charts as well, but don’t know how, I am sure you can find them. 

I am not knowledgeable enough to understand as to how serious this is or not? Hope you understand this better than me. 




By maintaining monetary policies easy but letting long-term yields free to move, the Federal Reserve gives support to lower quality credits while putting quality at risk. We are heading towards an unprecedented duration event that will weight on high duration assets, which in the bond market are concentrated within the investment-grade corporate space. The US investment grade (IG) corporate bond sector is heading to the worst quarter since 1981, with the utilities and communications sectors being more exposed to rising interest rates than others. The technology sector, which saw stellar valuations in the stock market last year, is characterized by a duration of eight and a half years, which matches the US IG average.
The market doesn't care about the Federal Reserve's dovish state of mind. The Fed said it itself: the economic outlook is improving substantially with inflation destined to rise together with the country's GDP, while the labour market gets stronger. Nevertheless, the central bank decided to stand still and continue with its accommodative monetary policy. This decision leaves the market with the
ONLY OPTION TO TAKE THE SITUATION INTO ITS OWN HANDS AND DUMPING TREASURIES
that will inevitably lose value.

The steeping of the US yield curve resumed this morning with the curve's belly and the benchmark 10-year yields rising faster than long-term US Treasuries. The big issue is that if economic forecasts and inflation expectations continue to rise, r
ATES WILL NOT STABILIZE UNTIL THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECIDES TO INTERVENE AND ENGAGE IN THE INFAMOUS YIELD CURVE CONTROL (YCC)
. In our view, YCC will be unavoidable because, although the market can function with higher rates now, the higher they go, the more the pain that will be inflicted on those assets with historically high durations.

The market is talking about 10-year yields hitting 2%; however, if the Federal Reserve continues to keep watching, they might rise much further. The Fed has been able to maintain easy financial conditions by keeping real rates negative. However, they will not stay negative forever. In normal circumstances, nominal yields should price over the breakeven rate. It means that if inflation expectations continue to rise, we inevitably will see 10-year yields rising above 2.3%.

A BROAD CROSS-ASSET SELLOFF MIGHT SPARK FROM HIGH-GRADE CREDITS  RATHER THAN JUNK

Yesterday’s FOMC meeting and today’s selloff in sovereigns reinforce our belief that
WE ARE WITNESSING A HISTORICAL DURATION EVENT
.
The investment-grade corporate bond market will fall faster than junk within this context because of its sensibility to higher duration. Indeed, while the average duration within junk is around three and a half years, the investment-grade bond space carries a duration of more than 8 years. Duration within quality credits has recently increased dramatically: in the past two years, duration has increased by one year and a half. To put things into context: it took four years after the global financial crisis for the duration to increase by as much.

18_03_AS2
If we put Treasuries into the equation, we would see that in 2013 amid the Taper Tantrum, 10-year yields rose by 130 basis points; however, investment-grade corporate bonds fell only by 2%. This year Investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen already by 3.36%, the most in forty years, with 10-year yields rising only by nearly 85bps showing that
DURATION IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN CREDIT QUALITY
. Indeed, by
MAINTAINING MONETARY POLICIES EASY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE GIVES SUPPORT TO LOWER QUALITY CREDITS ON ONE HAND. ON THE OTHER, BY LETTING LONG-TERM YIELDS MOVE FREELY WHILE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING, THE CENTRAL BANK PUTS QUALITY AT RISK.
And who sits on quality? Everybody, more in particular real money with long-term strategies such as insurances and pension funds. And again, it is deja-vu: we might be headed towards another Global Financial Crisis?

18_03_AS3
As the yield curve continues to steepen will be essential to limit interest rate sensitivity. It will be interesting to know that the sectors that carry the highest duration are the communication and utility sectors whose duration is well above 10 years. The technology sector is within the US IG average, with around eight years and a half in duration. For those looking for quality while reducing duration sensibly, high-grade financials provide 6 years duration, almost half than that offered by the communications and utility sectors.",
m8o13x,grij8q9,stocks,comment,1616182215,"All of this is routed in the bullshit that the economy you see today is the same one you saw in January 2020, when you could walk into a theatre and eat at a restaurant. 
Also at play is Republican propaganda that these stimulus packages will ruin the economy... because only Republicans are allowed to give stimulus.

The reality is that the economy can still fall off a cliff, there’s a real 3rd wave and a few virus strains that are not responding to vaccines, which means that this mess isn’t over.
There is still at least 7million people unemployed from 2019 high. 
There is rent and mortgage assistance, there are eviction moratoriums, and this is occurring the world around.

These assholes are literally looking at a Government supported economy and saying that things look great, so let’s make more money, while completely ignoring the massive amount of social assistance going on in the US and around the world (we’ll call these customers of the US).

So it’s literally punch a banker in the face month.  If you see some idiot going on about inflation, then punch them in the face.

Powell isn’t talking code. The economy stinks, it’ll take SOME TIME to get back to how things were.

All of these store price inflationary events are linked to cargo management problems due to poor management decisions at the onset of the pandemic. They laid off 30% of their workforce and then tried to automate some systems, and this backfired at the ports when demand went through the roof. They fell behind.  It’s the same level of stupidity as car company management, where they cancelled CPU contracts with a 2-year lead time, to save a few bucks, and then they were suddenly swamped by demand due to the move from cities to rural homes. They didn’t sell it like they made a stupid mistake though did they, they pissed and whined and framed it like a CPU shortage and made it political. 

Major economic reorganizations are always coupled with a recession. You simply can’t have everyone move into the suburbs at the same time without causing a loss of income in some sector of the economy (like downtown services). We’re also looking at huge deflationary events that are getting stronger.  Please point to a job that cannot be replaced by a computer or a robot, there are few remaining.",

First of all, looking at the ATH for the 10yr is baffling. The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago. They have consistently gone down over time. Isn’t it kind of obvious this is only short term? 

Secondly, how exactly is the 10 year related to a huge increase in inflation? I don’t get this concept. 

The way all this seems to me is that the media and other influencers are leeching onto something to create a bearish case against a roaring market. 

Thanks for your guidance!",
m84fqx,grfnm0w,stocks,comment,1616118498,"So, there's a few things happening that are all kind of related in varying degrees.

>how exactly is the 10 year related to a huge increase in inflation? I don’t get this concept.

They are kind of related but not really.  They are more separate than linked.

Let's start with inflation.  Inflation generally occurs in large amounts when there is a prolonged period of high velocity money printing.

A relatively recent example of this is pre-WWII Germany.  In this period, the German government employed a large number of its citizens to print money.  The recounts of the paper mills and printing presses are staggering.  In those days, they had to physically print the bills.  So, they did this for months and months and months and months.  Ultimately, it caused rampant inflation and economic collapse.

So, there is fear from some US investors that the combination of the 3 stimulus packages, the US government's history of running a deficit, and the federal reserve's current monetary policy will cause inflation.

This is more or less the inflation argument.  I wouldn't panic or get super worried over it.  The US government has economic tools to create and to reduce inflation.  If it starts to get too high, they can reign it in.

Next, the US Treasury bond interest rates are set by the US Treasury.  At its core, it is that simple.  Any given week, the bankers get together and decide how many bonds they want to sell and at what rate.  Then, they go out and try to sell them.  The results of the sale determine what happens going into the next week when they try to sell more.  If no one bought last week's set of bonds, they likely need to raise the interest rates to make them more attractive to buyers for the following week.

Now, the logical follow-up question, ""Why are people not buying them?"", is a very hard question to answer and is beyond what I know and can explain on the internet.

&#x200B;

>The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago

This is correct.  The US government has been pushing interest rates down since about the 1980s to stimulate the economy.  This is worrisome to certain US investors but, again, is beyond my understanding and ability explain.

And finally, stock prices.

There is a math equation analysts use to predict the future value of stock prices.  So, think like: ""x + y + z + w = stock price in the future""

One of those variables is the interest rate.  When the interest rate goes up, the stock price the math equation produces gets smaller.  So, large institutions and investors start selling as the interest rate climbs.",
m84fqx,grfj9d5,stocks,comment,1616116213,"Investors aren’t buying 10 year tbills at current prices because they think their return will be eroded by inflation. The US government still auctions off new debt (increasing supply). If no one buys these bonds, but supply increases, the price of these bond decrease (causing yields to rise). 

This is bad for stocks in a few ways:

10 yr is used in a lot of valuation models as risk free rate. Higher discount rate means lower valuations. 

Rising yields also increase the cost of borrowing which means less available cash for growth initiatives. If the company can’t grow, neither can their stock price. 

Higher bond yields also make bonds more attractive leading to a rotation out of equities.. we haven’t really seen this yet, but I’d expect this if/when 10 yr hits around 3-3.5%. 

Rates are not high relative to historical norms but we’ve been in a suppressed environment for 10+ years. There is also SO MUCH debt right now, which is why small movement in rates has caused this much volatility.

We are in a very precarious situation. So far the FED has played its cards right, but one wrong move could blow up the bond market.",

m83v0p,,stocks,post,1616110387,"SKLZ - A Rising Esports Giant (DD)Hey all. I'll be focusing on the fundamentals of the company here. This post is my first DD, and as such I welcome you to comment, provide feedback, poke holes in my analysis, and so on with open arms. If this is detailed enough to inform anyone about the company, then even better. With that being said, I'm organizing this in accordance with my DD spreadsheet that I use.

What is SKLZ?

SKLZ, or Skillz, is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games. Players use this platform to participate in millions of mobile and online competitions across the world daily. Skillz doesn't directly create games, as it lets third-party developers create them and then capitalizes on the opportunity to host online tournaments on said games. The company was founded in 2012 and, as far as I can tell, currently has about 230 employees. Their market cap currently sits at $10.84 Billion.

CEO Notes

Andrew Paradise is both the CEO and original founder of Skillz. He has led the company to $400 million in revenue. This is also not the first company he has founded and grown. In 2012, Paradise founded Double Picture, an advertising technology company, which went on to develop partnerships with Apple and was eventually sold. Paradise also founded AisleBuyer, a company whose technology was eventually sold to Intuit and became Intuit GoPayment. Having a CEO with this much prior experience and success is a great sign to me.

Financials

Skillz released their last report in December of 2020, which is what I'm working off of. Revenue grew 92% to $230 million in 2020, compared with $120 million during 2019. Gross profit grew 91% to $218 million during 2020, compared with $114 million in 2019. Gross margin was 95% during 2020, the same as the year prior. Net loss was $122 million during 2020, compared with a net loss of $24 million during 2019. GMV grew 80% to $1.6 billion during 2020, compared with $886 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $263 million of cash and no debt.

Partnerships (if Applicable)

Skillz joined forces with the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) in 2019, which was a large vote of confidence. In February of 2021, Skillz also started a partnership with the NFL. As part of the multi-year agreement, the organizations will hold a global game developer challenge. Those that take part will need to create an NFL-themed mobile title, which will be powered via Skillz's esports platform. This is a huge opportunity for visibility, and to expand Skillz's player base.

Potential Catalysts

The NFL agreement was my main one here. I think this partnership is a great way to expand the company's player base.

Other Notes

Management at Skillz says their users average an hour a day on their games, which is more than TikTok or Snapchat. Gaming tournaments, much like gambling, are addictive, and Skillz seems to be very adept at capitalizing on this. The CEO also mentioned in the company's last earning report that the company gets 90% of revenue from North America, and hopes to expand into India later this year. R&D also grew over 40% over the prior quarter, as the company moves to expand into new game releases (CEO has mentioned fighting, racing, and FPS games as future additions to their library) and further researches how to boost engagement among its user base.

Smartphone gaming revenue was estimated at over 63 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2020, with revenue from tablet games reaching 13.7 billion U.S. dollars. Moreover, forecasts suggest that revenue from the mobile gaming industry will continue to grow, surpassing the 100 billion U.S. dollar mark by 2023. This company is already in a great position to continue to capitalize on this market, provided they continue to focus on growing their player base and available games.

The Bear Case

Skillz currently gets over 70% of its revenue from three games alone, underlining how critical it will be for Skills to develop new games over time. Its regular users also dropped from 2.7 million to 2.4 million over the course of the past year. While their paying users did double, maintaining their revenue anyway, it could be a cause for concern. The company spent over $250 million in advertising last year, and their user base still declined. These numbers aren't damning by any means, but they do raise some concern for me.

Overall Opinion

In general, I believe that this company has massive potential to be huge. The global gaming market was valued at USD $162.32 billion in 2020, with a large portion of that market being in mobile and tablet gaming. With a current stock price at $26.75, I honestly feel that this company has the potential to grow and dominate the mobile esports market, and may grow to upwards of $60 over the next couple of years - and I feel that is a conservative estimate.","['INTU', 'AAPL']"

(OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis.

If you assume 5% return, you will have $150k. 

With 1% you will get to not quote $120k (savings account)

So it makes a huge difference compared to savings/cash.

Hopefully you can save more than $10k as you get older and hopefully get a better job. 401k max is $19.5k and then you can stash another $6k in an Ira. So that’s $25.5k/yr. 

If you start today with $10k, invest $25k/yr for 25 years at 10% average return, you will be sitting at almost $3m.

m884j4,,stocks,post,1616124187,"The 10 year and its effect on marketsIn light of recent events, can someone please clarify how the 10 year effects the markets? I seem to be a little confused.

From my understanding, the 10 year is the prime benchmark that measures investor sentiment across financial markets. If bond prices are down yields go up, that signals that investors feel they can make a higher return elsewhere ( i.e. confidence in the markets) if bond prices are higher and yields are trending downwards it would suggest the opposite. 

My question is this: why did a hike in the 10 year yield spook the market into a sell off today? Rising yield rates indicate that investor confidence in the market is high, right? So wouldn’t we only need to be concerned with lower yield rates? (i.e. low confidence in the market; investors feel that their money is better off in bonds rather than the stock market)",
m884j4,grg6tcc,stocks,comment,1616129915,"Great answers in this thread. The one I want I focus on is [Graham’s calculation for the intrinsic value of a stock](https://tradebrains.in/graham-calculator/). Let’s say you have a company that isn’t profitable yet, but has positive earnings per share and is growing at 100% per year. You’d be a fool not to invest, right? This is where Graham’s calculator comes in:

V* = (EPS x (8.5 x 2g) x 4.4)/Y

Where V* is the intrinsic value of a share, EPS is the earnings per share, g is the growth rate, and Y is the yield on corporate AAA bonds. Let’s say the growth rate is 100%, EPS is $0.2, and corporate bond yields are 1%. This would give us the following:

$185 = (0.2 x (8.5 x 2 x 100) x 4.4)/1%

Awesome! $185 per share! This is going to the moon 🚀

Now let’s say nothing changes, but the denominator (bond yields) jumps up to 2%:

$91 = (0.2 x (8.5 x 2 x 100) x 4.4)/2%

$91? The Bears are shorting the stock! Market manipulation. 

What has happened is that the interest rates on the loans the company needs have increased, which directly hurts their profitability. Doesn’t matter how great the company is - if they need those loans, profitability is going to suffer. This is what people mean by growth vs. value stocks - growth stocks depend on that growth number to outpace interest rates. Value stocks don’t need it as much, but sacrifice growth. That was true during COVID-19 when interest rates were low. The economy is recovering, and so are interest rates.  Now you know something about how the algos think. There isn’t an evil cabal of hedge funds manipulating your favorite stock - it’s just leveraged and it’s growth was always fragile. 

This is why EV, tech, and other stocks are getting hammered. Now, it’s frustrating because not all growth stocks depend on corporate bonds equally. But there’s something of a snowball effect to this. Some stocks are going to be great buys because they’re getting dragged down by panic. Others are going to get hit much worse. It’s hard to say which right now, but debt is a good place to start to sort them out.

A quick addendum: Fed Chair Powell’s primary goal is to decrease unemployment, and he recognizes that interest rates should stay low - fighting inflation now would hurt job openings. But he doesn’t control the 10 year. It is responsive to market demands. The fact that the 10 year is behaving erratically suggests to me that we are heading into unknown territory, and we’re seeing volatility because the future isn’t clear to anyone. Algos are thus being defensive of profits, hence the whiplash we’re getting almost every week.",

I'm going to stick only to the car related stuff here, not the stock:

1. I test drove both. They are both fine. However, VW feels chintzy to me. The reason why no one wanted an electric car for the longest time is that chintziness (edit: and low range). Tesla made people want to buy an electric car, not only for the environment, but also for their own enjoyment and the pride of ownership. I was an owner of a VW (not electric, obviously), and I can't get excited about having another. If I were to be buying Tesla, then yes.
2. VW's weakest point has always been the software/the electric. THAT was always the glitchiest, most annoying part of their cars. So I'm a bit concerned with them going full electric when they couldn't even implement a non-glitchy software in their Jetta. In other words, I cannot even compare Tesla's software to VWs. Or I can... and Tesla wins hands down.
3. For me, the aesthetics are incomparable. Tesla feels like a spaceship. I admit it's a different price range, but the inside is incredibly comfortable and aesthetically beautiful. And I'm still impressed that they pulled off the falcon wing doors.

i was looking at doing whatever position name is for a cash secured put, but without the cash secured.  i thought that would be a naked short put, but it seems like naked short put is when you are simply not short on the underlying. which makes sense.

so what is it when you are simply opening a short put position, without a CSP?

i cant seem to see the downside here. because:

1. if underlying goes up, you keep premium like any short put position.

2. if it stays flat but above strike. same as 1

3. if it drops, dont you still buy the underlying for the strike price?",
m8cl28,grgsj1b,stocks,comment,1616150161,"A short put is where you sell or ""write"" a put contract that didn't previously exist. You are selling someone else the right (but not the obligation) to sell you 100 shares of the stock at the strike price, before or on the expiration date. You're the one who has to buy if the holder chooses to exercise their put. If the option is exercised, you call this ""getting assigned"" or ""assignment.""

&#x200B;

A covered put is where you're already short 100 shares of that stock, so if the you get assigned and have to buy someone else's shares, you're covering your shortsold shares, at the strike price. A cash-secured short put is where you don't actually shortsell those 100 shares, but you have enough cash to cover being assigned if it happens anyway, and put that up.

&#x200B;

If you have a cash-secured put, you must keep the required cash to pay for the possible exercise of that put, in your account, at all times, until AFTER expiration or assignment. So if it's a strike of $50, you need to keep $5,000 cash in your account AT ALL TIMES until this option goes away one way or another.

&#x200B;

A naked short put is where you sell the put without having short shares, or the cash in your account to cover being assigned, and unless you know what you're doing you are going to put yourself in a dangerous spot by doing this, and probably won't be allowed by your broker to do it anyway.",

m7qyyy,,stocks,post,1616074634,"NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investmentI bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have continuously added to on most dips. 

**The Bull Case**

* A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the next decade
* User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow
* Leader in its market segments – best in class products
* Gaming - Huge pricing power because of innovative, high quality product improvements such as ray tracing
* Strong competitive advantage with its CUDA software stack
* Mellanox acquisition also gives it a serious competitive advantage in Data Center
* 15% Rev and 20% earnings growth expected per year in the next 5 years.
* The ARM deal, if it goes through will be a huge shot in the arm for NVDA as a strategic near monopoly in licensing 
* NVDA has bought a majority of ARM with its own stock at $485 per share. The equity dilution is only 7%.

**The Bear Case**

* Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales 
* Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. 
* Crypto revenue is not sustainable 
* Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand

**Challenges**

The ARM deal may not go through

The chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low.  Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.

With these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.

There are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here’s the one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2)–  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.

The second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words.

>“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  
>  
>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.”

**Valuation**

Sure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower.

m7tn9w,,stocks,post,1616082280,"Followup to the Stock Scraper Analysis from yesterday (03/17/21)This is in response [to this post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)

&#x200B;

I should have expected it but it didn't occur to me until it started happening, but too many people being in the sheet at the same time locked it up to where most people got errors. I was sending out copies of the sheet but with hundreds of DMs it was getting to be too much to keep up with. I'm interested in presenting this in a way that people can access all the want without it locking up, but although I'm an expert with Excel I don't know Python and don't have any experience auto-publishing stuff online. If anyone can help with that let me know!

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, the most common question I got was how I interpret data so I will give examples from today's data below. Keep in mind that none of this is a clear ""buy me!!"" flashing light, it's just how I interpret the data. I've been getting 10% - 15% returns on about 80% of my picks. The indicators convinced me to buy UWMC, ASO, ASRT, RMBL, CVR, SJR, and AMD within the last week. Of all of them the only one I lost money on was RMBL, the rest all sold at a profit.

&#x200B;

So what am I looking at today? Before I go into the criteria, here's what the data has shown my so far. This could change after another few weeks of tracking, but as of right now it says:

1. The social media platform that is the most successful in picking stocks is Reddit
2. Tickers with a Reddit score of 500 or under have been the most likely to go green in the next week
3. The average % return for those categories is 15%
4. The average days until it hits max profit is 6 days

&#x200B;

**All that being said, here's the criteria I look for:**

1. Using Unbias data I copy/paste all the Reddit data for the last 24 hours into my excel sheet
2. From there I filter it down to just items with a score under 500
3. I have a column that calculates the % increase between yesterday and today so I sort it by % return
4. I filter out anything that has already had more than 5% growth. Those aren't necessarily bad buys, I just want the full 15% as often as I can get it
5. I enter each ticker into the Reddit search and manually get rid of anything that isn't a real ticker (sometimes the scraper picks up repeated things that look like tickers but are just phrases)
6. I note any ticker that is being mentioned across at least 4 different subs. I'm looking for stocks that are getting mentioned all over, not just multiple times in 1 sub
7. I filter out anything that looks like it's just bots posting all over the place

&#x200B;

From there I try narrow it down to 3 - 5 that I feel the best about. Keep in mind I'm trading 100% on sentiment, so I don't do any DD on the company itself. My assumption is that if a lot of people are talking about it then they've done all the DD for me, I just have to follow the crowd and jump on the band wagons that are just starting to move. The strategy has worked pretty well, as of today I'm up about 22% since starting this.

&#x200B;

**How do I put it to use?**

1. I spread the money evenly across 3 - 5 of the tickers that just feel the best to me.
2. I hold for no longer than a week. I sell somewhere between 10% and 15%, but if it hits 7 days I sell no matter what. Usually I sell after 5 business days, but sometimes I'll hold a week. If I take a loss I take a loss, but usually I'm up

&#x200B;

So what are my picks today? These are the ones I'm going to look into. I have no idea what will pop and what I'll choose, but these are the ones I'm most curious about based on today's data. I don't know if they're good or not, don't know anything about the companies - only that they fit into the categories that are the most profitable in the spreadsheet

&#x200B;

m84zn3,,stocks,post,1616113830,"Why I bought Motley Fool and why I hate foolAbout a month ago my wife saw this motley fool (MF) promotion on our Amex card. Before I can object the card was already processed and now she’s strongly insist that I take a look. Now it’s no cost since Amex rebated 100% of the first year, but she wasn’t happy with my constant cringe when she ask me to check it out...so yea I got sent to the dog house. 

Why I hate this type of advice: well if the idea is so great and an investor can do consistently beat the market then they can easily sell their service to manage other peoples money. So by selling this kind of publication it means what they do here is probably not their core competency. 

Upon paying the 100 bucks that’s not mine by someone that’s not me...I got a  very glossy portfolio of welcome packages and my membership card! In there it also introduced me to the founder, founder philosophy and their core staff...my trusted advisors who are passionate about stock investing. let’s look at my trusted advisors...they come from all corners of life experience...except business, math, or finance. Typical bio tend to be like “marketing major got their taste of investing while interning here then stayed here ever since”. Maybe they can bring a different perspective than a seasoned professional. 

The HATE: 

ok maybe I don’t hate hate these guys like most of the others. I do find their advertising deceptive. I tried recreate their portfolio based on their past stocks. Because they don’t post when each position should be sold, I can only build it on a rolling 5 year holding period for each position while adding the 2 per month they rave about. 

Rolling Returns does indeed tend to be higher than SP500, but why? 
For the past 2 years it really shot up but It is really attributed to FAANG. Removing this abnormality then return are more consistent to historical rate of returns. 

One of the glaring difference between their stocks and the index was the company sizes. Each of the company MF suggested at the time of suggestion to be averaging 8Billion in market cap. The minimum cap to enter SP500 is around 6B or 7B, so this means by adding only the smallest companies, you introduce more volatility thus a higher expected return. By their selection, SP500 is not the most appropriate index to be benchmarked to. An appropriate benchmark is more like SP400 or Russ1000(not 2000). These are more like mid-large cap stocks. Running the same model with these benchmark the excess return is reduced significantly. 

There’s also an issue with their investment philosophy which is supposed to be good valuation, good growth potential, and not in the spotlight. Well it tends to be only a growth story at the time of suggestion. Valuation always tend to be on the high side, and they are usually in the headlines. 

Conclusion:

So at least if you follow the 5 year holding period and keep adding it. It’s an OK strategy. MF definitely embellished A LOT in their ads...my reasoning on what they’re selling are these mid caps that has a nice growth story that their writers can justify on. If the stock can solidify themself within SP500 then it’ll outperform, and they’ll quietly not talk about those that flopped (like Lukin Coffee). They have been aggressively marketing probably because they are just riding the faanged unicorn right now. 

Is it worth the 100 per year? If you some money to spare and no better resource other than wallstreetbet....I guess you can try it.  To make this worth it you probably need to allocate $500 for each stock. That means 12000 a year....less than 1% of outperformance to break even for something that so far looks ok given the risk you’re taking on. Anything less 10K per year wouldn’t make it feasible. It also means holding for 5 years while adding so means in 5 years you need to be investing $50K-60K. Does one have the fund or strict discipline to do this?

You buy another $100 worth of stock on margin you now have -$100 cash and $200 stock.  (They are willing to do this because they know their $100 is safe because you can sell the stock to pay back your loan).

The stock market drops in half and now you have $-100 cash and only $100 stock.  (This scares them because if the stock drops any lower you can't actually pay back the loan so this is when you get a margin call but in this case it is probably only for $50 to get back to that 2-1 ratio)

You deposit $50 to make up the margin call you still have -$50 cash and $100 stock (they are now happy because your stock can cover the loan).

The actual margin percentage will vary by broker and stock based on how risky it is and how likely it is to drop fast.

m8gmql,,stocks,post,1616158547,"What are the benefits of CRM after Covid-19?Dear Mate,  please share your thoughts about the benefits of CRM :-)

In this modern digital era, it is critical to attracting new customers, nurture the existing customers and retain the customers. After the covid-19 situation, brands have moved their business from physical location to online digital platforms. For such reasons, brands are getting advantages to implementing automation on the website. The automation is so powerful that the brand doesn't let any customer lost through the custom relationship management software, commonly called CRM software.

Moreover, CRM helps a brand in multiple ways to optimize the brand's effectiveness in treating its customers to satisfy their needs and requirements. However, there are some benefits that encourage brands to implement CRM software on their website.

1. **It collects multiple data from multiple sources in multiple formats and stores them in one place to serve better and provide recommendations to the clients and users as well.**
2. **The CRM software automatically engages with the existing customers or subscribers about the event, promotions, or discounts. So no more extra efforts consumed to inform anything to customers.**
3. **Via CRM software, brands can target subscribers and customers with better promotional tools via email marketing. CRM also provides data and information about the movements of the customer from email to website.**
4. **CRM software integrates with social media marketing, gives the power to the brand to optimize all the campaigns with automation.**
5. **The major benefit of CRM is to give customer support service to the clients. Even during the purchase cycle, customers won't be lost because they will be communicated and supported by the automation throughout the process. This makes a brand more authentic via CRM software.**
6. **Analytics of big data captured via CRM software gives valuable insights to the brand to target and re-target the according to the target audience's preferences.**

There are few advantages, but the giants are exploring the CRM tool to make it more effective to achieve their primary goal by reducing the cost and expenses of hiring human resources when it can be done in a very professional, effective, and efficient way.

I do not currently personally hold a position in INTC, but others I advise do either directly or indirectly and I or they may enter into additional positions in the near future.*

Intel has had a tough time the last few years as manufacturing missteps, and tough competition from AMD has materially hurt their business. AMD’s Zen 3 offering has only highlighted the problem, particularly in the booming and sizeable enterprise CPU market. This has been the focus of investors for quite some time, with emphasis on their hybrid fabless model going forward dictating price moves recently. Despite the progress made in recent months in trying to address their prior missteps, street expectation is still for a 6% revenue decline in 2021 vs. AMD which is projected to grow revenue by 38% over the same period. This has caused AMD to outperformed Intel by 564% through the trailing 3-year period and has weighed on valuation metrics for INTC relative to semiconductor peers. INTC now trades at 8x BF EV/EBITDA relative to AMD’s 30x and the semiconductor industry’s mean 16.5x. 

The company replaced the former CEO in January of 2021 with Pat Gelsinger, who has a rich engineering background at INTC. His focus so far has been on stabilizing the CPU business, which I believe he has started to do (although there is still a lot of work to do). Additionally, by utilizing a hybrid production model primarily with TSMC the design team at INTC shouldn't be held back by any manufacturing missteps. This, in my view, gives marginal upside to street forecasts on the existing revenue lines, but nothing super compelling near-term.

What I think most investors are missing, though, is the rather substantial opportunity for Intel graphics. The GPU market has been incredibly starved recently with pretty much no availability. Tailwinds with blockchain applications, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud proliferation, etc., have only exacerbated the growth profile in GPU TAM. Investors, though, have been promised again and again compelling graphics offerings only to be disappointed by countless delays, which is probably the root cause of the mispricing and healthy skepticism.

NVDA and AMD currently dominate the GPU market. NVDA has had its dominant position go largely unchecked for quite some time, but both simply cannot supply enough GPUs for the demand in the current market. This gives Intel’s long-delayed Xe graphics offering an incredible opportunity as they don’t need to unseat NVDA in terms of pure performance to be competitive but rather just need to have a compelling offering with adequate supply. Though nothing is confirmed, they’re rumored to have partnered with TSMC for production on their 7nm process, which would be competitive. 

This also gives Pat Gelsinger an opportunity to reframe sentiment around the company by laying out a roadmap to dominate a massive market the company currently doesn’t play in.

I believe the “Intel Unleashed: Engineering the Future” webcast next Tuesday, 3/23/21 ([https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/media-alert-engineering-future/#gs.wiegid](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/media-alert-engineering-future/#gs.wiegid)), will be a great form for this. Given the rumors around INTC’s Xe graphics and some hints such as Raja Koduri’s, INTCs chief architect, recent tweets, I believe this could be a catalyst for valuation repricing.

On the upside, I believe the company could reprice to the industry EV/EBITDA multiple of 16x depending on the potential market share capture based on how competitive the company’s GPU line is. If there is a lack of emphasis on graphics or the offering isn’t very competitive however I think the downside is minimized by the fact that the market doesn’t seem to be currently pricing in anything interesting with regards to GPUs, and the company currently trades at roughly its two-year historical average BF EV/EBITDA with the 2% dividend yield giving some support.","['GS', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'NVDA']"

AMD took market share from intel mostly in the datacenters.  ATI/AMD combo likely the reason for their success with gaming consoles.  IMHO Intel will need to buy a GPU company (but who??) to catch up.  Intel has struggled in IOT space, losing to ARM designs. Depending on the success of the macs with the  ARM (m1), could be another headwind for intel.

Volkswagen plans to **produce and sell a total of 1 million electric cars (including hybrids) in 2021**. About half of these will be purely electric. Due to the high number of existing production facilities (**VW produces about 10 million vehicles per year**), VW's EV division has been growing about **twice as fast as Tesla since last year**. Volkswagen has several factories in China and the USA where production is currently being switched to mass-produced EV models. The following EVs will be sold by Volkswagen in 2021:

Audi: Etron, Etron Q4, Etron GT

Porsche: Taycan, Taycan 2WD, Taycan cross tourismo

Skoda: Enyak

Seat: Cupra El Born

VW is already one of the world's biggest auto manufactures.  It is not possible for VW to grow very much more due to this.  I think the auto industry itself is only forecasted to grow about 3%.

If you bid up the price of VW, I believe it can only end in disaster.

This is honestly a foreshadowing of the entire EV dilemma.  It's just not like technology companies in the 90s / early 2000s.

People and businesses already own cars.  They don't really need more cars.  Sure - EV is a great technology and I am glad it is also environmentally friendly.  However, the world is not going from zero cars to a massive market of EV cars.

In the tech boom, the world changed and became more efficient.  Companies went from owning no computers to hundreds of computers and this dramatically improved the efficiency of their business.  And despite all of this, the market still bubbled and crashed.

EV just can not deliver this type of efficiency.  Everyone is still going to own more or less the same amount of cars.  Everyone is still going to commute and be stuck in traffic jams.

This was pretty recent, shortly before 10 year T note yields spiked and growth stocks started to correct, so it continued to tank as the broader market tanked.  Also around this time they announced their March financial reports would be delayed, which was basically foreshadowing this accounting debacle that dropped this week. 

Analysts are maintaining their bullish ratings, although I don’t know if this whole issue w the accounting has been factored in yet. Right now it’s unclear what the new accounting will report. The company is signalling that it’s all good. 

Basically, decide if you believe in H2 economy in general, and if you do, PLUG is probably still the best choice at the moment  (they actually have product and contracts w lots of big companies, and also have raised a lot of capital this last year). Tbh you should be looking forward like 5-10 years for profits. If H2 energy becomes widespread, these guys will be a major player. 

Also, maybe just wait till after this whole accounting thing if you haven’t bought yet.

S&P 500 P/E: 45.02

NASDAQ P/E: 37.25

Am I missing something? NASDAQ contains stocks that have growth rates that are higher than the Dow Jones and S&P 500, in sectors that are essential and used by almost everyone in the first world. Yet people refer to buying stocks that are contained in the other major indexes as ""value picks"" despite the fact they are in industries that are dying or heavily flawed, such as financials (being challenged by DeFi and Fintech), airlines which will take several years just to return to the same levels of revenue they were at during their peaks etc. While the argument for tech has only improved.

If the NASDAQ was to dip even 10% further than it is now it would be significantly undervalued when compared to the other major indexes. Can someone explain to me why tech (with reasonable P/E ratios such as AAPL, FB, AMD) can't be considered value picks given their clear growth prospects in the future and current P/E ratios of 20-35?","['FB', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ', 'DOW', 'AMD']"

m71xi8,,stocks,post,1615992143,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates**TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data

**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

&#x200B;

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.

&#x200B;

**In the end the two I landed on were:**

[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms

[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data

&#x200B;

**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
   * What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
   * Which social media is the most profitable?
   * What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
   * How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

&#x200B;

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

&#x200B;

**Other interesting finds:**

Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible

StockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%

**Conclusions:**

Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

# Summary

* With increasing demand for Lithium I wanted to find a Lithium producer that has strong reserves and upside in the medium to long term
* LAC has the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America and the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* These two assets are under development but are nearing completion. Price dipped recently but based on their existing assets and recent analyst price targets LAC seems like a decent investment

# Lithium Background

I wanted to understand how Lithium is extracted to make sure I could gauge the viability of the lithium mining companies I was looking at. I summarized my findings below if you are curious. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022. [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/lithium-production-2340123#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20extract%20lithium,increasingly%20high%20concentrations%20of%20lithium.)

Tpa = Tonnes Per Annum – essentially how much Lithium they can extract on a yearly basis

# Market Overview

To summarize – Lithium demand is expected to grow exponentially. 2 main factors:

1. Falling Lithium prices over the last 3 years reduce investment in Lithium production globally
2. Surging demand for EVs and shift to green energy

**Lithium prices continue to soar – up 88% in 2021** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/lithium-prices-continue-to-soar-up-88-in-2021/)

**Schlumberger unit to launch Nevada lithium plant as EV demand rises** [**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-schlumberger-energy-plans-lithium-134649877.html)

If you haven’t heard of Schlumberger check them out, they are the world’s largest oilfield service company. If they are shifting into the lithium production space then the leadership team sees value and growth here. Also from the article “Demand for battery-grade lithium is projected to grow exponentially, driven by growth in the electric vehicle market, and efficient production of the metal has become an important topic for regions, industries, and technology companies.”

**Battery grade lithium prices in China surge 68%** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/battery-grade-lithium-prices-in-china-surge-68/)

While lithium’s majors are beginning to reengage in expansion plans, three years of falling lithium prices have failed to incentivize sufficient investment into the supply chain, leading to greater risks of price volatility as battery demand ramps up.

Trading Economics forecast of Lithium Prices [here](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lithium)

The prices here are in yuan/tonne so if we use a conversion rate of 1 yuan = $0.15 USD. Assume price is around 80,000 yuan/tonne then it is about $12,000 USD/tonne

# Lithium Americas

Leadership is one of the key aspects I look at when considering an investment. Most of their leadership team has 20+ years in lithium or resource production. They have a CTO who has 1-\_ year of lithium processing experience and used to work for Tesla. Check out their investor [presentation](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf) for a bit of background, but essentially from what I’ve seen they have a strong management team.

2 Main sites under development for Lithium

**Caucharí-Olaroz, Argentina (Brine Extraction)**

* Caucharí-Olaroz is the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America
* Partnered with Ganfeng Lithium on the jointly owned operation in Jujuy, Argentina
* Average production 40,000 tpa battery-grade Li2CO3
* After-Tax NPV10% is $1.5 billion
* Quick math: 40,000 tpa x $12,000 USD/tonne = $480M USD annually
* Note: Production doesn’t start until 2022
* Capital expenditures for the Project remain on budget with $477 million (84%) of the $565 million committed, including $388 million (69%) spent, as of December 31, 2020.

**THACKER PASS LITHIUM PROJECT (Clay Extraction)**

* Developing the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* 100% owned by Lithium Americas with offtake rights uncommitted
* On January 15, 2021, the US Bureau of Land Management issued the Record of Decision following completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process.
* All remaining state permits and water right transfers required to commence construction **are expected later this year.**
* Top ten biggest lithium mines in the world [here](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) **Thacker Pass Lithium Project is #2**

Summary of March 2, 2021 Full Year and Q4 Report

I highlighted some key points and provided commentary to their recent Annual report

* · As at December 31, 2020, the Company had $148 million in cash and cash equivalents ($518 million as at February 28, 2021). **great position to be in, especially with heavy CAPEX projects, especially with amount that has been spend in Argentina**
* · On January 22, 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock and issued 18,181,818 common shares at a price of $22.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $400 million (approximately $377 million net proceeds). **This is big especially if you look at the current price**
* On November 30, 2020, Lithium Americas completed an at-the-market equity program (“ATM Program”) and issued a total of 9,266,587 common shares from treasury for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million ($97 million net proceeds). **Price was \~$10 a share at this point in time**

Link [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-reports-2020-full-122600429.html)

**Analyst Price Target**

* High: $30.50
* Average: $21.42
* Low: $16.00

# Risks

* **Nevada Permits** – This is always an unknow, they expect to receive permits by mid to late 2021. The Biden administration has made it clear they want to secure supply of precious resources but this permitting is at the State Level so if there is an issue this could delay the project.
* **Argentina and China Partnership**: Their Argentinian assets is a joint venture with a Chines Lithium producer. So far it seems like development of the site has gone smoothly but geopolitical issues could prove to be a risk

# TLDR

* Price of lithium is increasing due to increased demand and ramp down of production over last 3 years
* Current US administration is looking to support and secure supply chain of critical materials and production – LAC owns 100% of the largest known lithium resource in America
* Opportunity to buy the dip and hold medium to long term

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures hit by another jump in Treasury yields

> * Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures fell Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 14-month high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

> * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

*****

> # 2. Bond traders continue to battle the Fed on rates

> * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

*****

> # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

> * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

> * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

> # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

> * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

> # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

> * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

So, I have always wanted to get into commercial real estate, and thought I would make my first investment, albeit a very small one to start off. 

I will lay out the deal, and was hoping people can give their insights, see if im missing someone, etc. 

Its in a well populated city near the beach. Real estate prices have moved with the provincial and national average consistently. No issues there. 

Its a single office, in a 8 office building, on a busy/popular street. 

Cost is $100,000. 

850 Square feet

Leasing goes for around $15 per square foot/annually. 

\-------------------

So, naturally I think this is a great deal. I could just plop down the entire $100,000, and I am looking at  $12750 per year income (thats of course before strata costs, electrical, etc). 

What am I missing? Seems quite good, for just $100,000 investment. 

Hoping to get some more insight! Thanks!",

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too. 

Otherwise I believe its a good buy in the short term",['AMZN']

The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

   Continuing claims, week ended March 6: 4.124 million vs. 4.034 million expected and 4.144 million during the prior week

Initial unemployment claims were expected to hold below 800,000 for a fourth consecutive week. Still, initial jobless claims remain above the Great Recession-era high of 665,000 from 2009. And new claims still need to fall significantly further to return to 2019 levels, when new claims averaged just over 200,000 per week.

After some buzz in media with some quite heavy players investing I thought I'd reach out too see if I could join in. Seeing as I'm no millionaire this will be one of the few times I'm able to particiapte. I belive in their business model bigly and honestly think they have a very good chance of succeeding.

Up until now I've only invested in stocks and mutual funds so when it comes to investing in privately-held companies what pitfalls and financial key metrics should I look at / ask them?

The company today:

* Current outstanding shares: 6m
* Implied equity value: 23m USD

They are about to initiate another round of funding, this will be a large round where they are trying to raise 440m USD since they are scaling up substatntionally from local to national distribution and sales in order to supply demand , if sucessfull it will change the numbers to:

* Outstanding shares: 15.5m
* Estimated valuation: 440m USD

The second question you should be asking yourself is what is the available market and what chance do they have of capturing enough to justify the valuation. By 'm' I assume you mean million, not thousand. 440 million isnt exactly chump change. Plenty of public companies are valued lower. 

The third question you should be asking yourself is what is the exit plan. Going public? Acquisition? Selling your shares back? Profit sharing? 

Beyond that, you need to see audited books, projected sales, general business plan etc. You need counsel and accounting. Do these shares come with voting rights? Are you already under NDA? How easily can the product and/or business model be copied and improved upon? What have they identified as gaps? Have they had an independent consultant come in and what gaps did their report indicate?

But what people forget is you also don’t want to buy long-duration equities,” Bernstein, CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC’s “[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/)” on Wednesday. “What’s a long-duration equity? Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia , the capital of drugs. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).

&amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows alnost all the various stamps website growing hugely in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)

&amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

[10-K report.](https://wallmine.com/doc/edgar/0001082923/000108292321000033/stmp-20201231.htm)

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

m7wm04,grfobvq,investing,comment,1616118883,"I think STMP is a great play. Good post! I'm surprised the company isn't talked about more.

In Feb it saw a huge drop in share price after earnings, from about 280 to 190. They smashed it, beating expectations, but were a bit vague, not offering future guidance about how their performance would be affected as covid improved (obviously they have benefitted from shops being shut and people ordering pointless shit online). This uncertainty unnerved investors and tanked the stock; to me it seems like a huge overreaction. E-commerce is obviously going to grow into the future, and Stamps.com have products that address all sizes of organisations.

They have made some really good aquisitions in the e-commerce space (ShipStation and MetaPack come to mind, although the latter might be impacted a bit by Brexit).

There is a share buyback incoming. I'm kinda new to this stuff, but some things I have read imply that they might be trying to suppress the share price for the buyback. Also, as the OP alluded to above, there seems like some dodgy kinda stuff going on with insider options which I don't fully understand (there is some good chat about this on Yahoo Finance, if anyone can explain I would be grateful!)

Overall though I am bullish, I think in a few months it will be back at 280 or so and much higher into the future (analyst targets in the 300-400 range). I think it works both as a short term and long term play.",

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

m7ih59,,investing,post,1616039606,"The Current State of Uranium. A Move In Spot Price Could Be SoonGenerally speaking, I am looking at uranium as a macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market. At a high level, uranium needs to be in the $50+ (some say $60+) range in order to cover the cost of production. Right now the spot price is hovering around $30.   

That being said, uranium is outperforming. So what then is driving this run? Are we likely to see a move in spot soon?

Personally, I think that the equities are ahead of themselves a little bit and that we could be seeing a pull back soon. I hope not. Still, the spot price is a little bit of a question mark for me because I have seen a number of interviews saying that we are very close for a move in the uranium price. This has led me to the view that I should hold my positions and slowly build until the spot price starts to move.  It’s a risk, but my hypothesis is that the real move will far outpace where we are today.  

Ultimately, uranium is about climate change more than anything and so I am glad we are ahead of schedule. Nuclear is the only way to achieve the carbon goals. 

I will be watching closely in the next few weeks for any movement in the uranium price. Should the spot rise as many of us expect, uranium stock prices will soar.

As always. I am interested in how others perceive the current landscape. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",

Since this post, numerous people have messaged me with more information around FTFT. I personally found it very insightful and thought this community would as well. I've looked deeper into those comments and this is what I've found.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

---

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['ETSY', 'PYPL', 'AMZN', 'EBAY']"

It's a sinking ship currently, and they need a really big idea to plug a lot of holes. 

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['FB', 'AMZN', 'EBAY']"

A common index investing strategy is some S&P500, some international and put some away in bonds/bank (percentages don’t really matter for this example)

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern.

m71yzd,,investing,post,1615992262,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

(Market cap calculations used for 50 years out is multiplying by 29.45, which is 1.07^50)",['SPGI']

1) Nobody thinks otherwise, EMH as a concept hasn't been accepted in the mainstream as a universal truth for 40 years, both in academia or professional finance.  Efficiency also isn't a binary, it exists within gradients in all markets - so something like large cap stock is far more efficient than junk debt, but both are less efficient than treasuries.  Still the idea that efficiency is a perfect condition that exists magically simply isn't a reality.

2) if EMH were accepted as some sort of holy truth then a poorly written blog post citing trades would not constitute strong evidence.

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'TGT']"

m6o8ek,,investing,post,1615942777,"[CNBC] Uber grants more than 70,000 UK drivers worker status after losing major labor battle.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html

On the heels of losing a major labor battle in the United Kingdom, Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers. 

Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers will receive some benefits, including minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions, but they will not get full employee benefits. 

Uber announced the change in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, adding that its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

While the move will increase Uber’s costs in the U.K., the company is still targeting adjusted EBITDA profitability by year-end.

Earlier this year, Uber lost a major legal battle in the U.K. around this issue. The country’s Supreme Court upheld a ruling that a group of drivers were workers, not independent contractors. While the decision applied to a small group of drivers, thousands more have taken action against the company.

In an op-ed in The Evening Standard, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote that following the Supreme Court ruling, “we could have continued to dispute drivers’ rights to any of these protections in court. Instead, we have decided to turn the page.”

“I know many observers won’t pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle,” Khosrowshahi said. “They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.”

Meanwhile, Uber and the gig economy as a whole is facing regulatory challenges around the globe. Uber has spent millions battling those challenges in other regions. 

In California, Uber pushed back against Assembly Bill 5, a gig-economy law passed by the state legislature in 2019 that tightened the rules for classifying workers as independent contractors. 

After a widespread campaign, costing over $200 million — the most expensive ballot measure in the state’s history — Uber and a handful of other gig-economy companies persuaded voters to support a ballot measure called Proposition 22, which exempted Uber and other gig-economy platforms from state employment law.

In turn, gig workers received some benefits without full employment status. Some of the additional costs of providing benefits were passed on to ride-hailing customers.",['ED']

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet.

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['GPS', 'PGR']"

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['QCOM', 'BA', 'ARKK', 'MMM', 'IBM', 'INTC', 'TXN', 'TER', 'NVDA']"

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

Is there a Vanguard index fund that encompasses his description of Asian/Chinese emerging markets?

Alibaba's internet browser has been removed from several app stores in China, according to a report from The Financial Times on Tuesday.

Android app stores including those operated by Huawei, Xiaomi and Tencent have reportedly blocked downloads or removed Alibaba's ""UC Browser."" CNBC was unable to immediately confirm the report.

 I check the reason UC browser got deleted from app store is they advertise fake medicines(the drug promise lower blood sugar, or losing weight but it's all bullshit) and that's illegal in China. Not only BABA's app got deleted they are many other app got warning. Including 360(a big cyber security company), multiple job searching app, ford(transmission problem), Infiniti(transmission problem), Kohler, Max Mara(install face recognition camera in their store to analyze customer), and many other companies.

m7c6gf,,investing,post,1616019296,"Apple (fruit) stock analogySo many people are talking about stocks this year, which is similar to the past times when stocks are shooting up and the majority of people are generally winning for now, and feeling good about it, and eager to talk about it, for all sorts of reasons.  

That includes everyone from novice investors to advanced and sophisticated investors, and everyone in between.

One of the most concerning things I hear is this.  

""You should by X.""

""Why?""

""Oh, it was 300 dollars yesterday.  It's 250 now.  So it's cheap.  It's going to go back up"".

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

m6w42x,gr7ymhr,investing,comment,1615973992,"Need some advice here.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

m6lakz,,investing,post,1615933928,"Plug power - unravelling the jargonI do love having a go at deciphering the management bullsh8t when they have dodgy accounts (sorry if you own it). Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.


Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

Amazon is Jeff’s flywheel. More customers = more revenue to invest in CapEx = more capabilities/lower prices = more customers. There’s a massive CapEx moat if you want to enter the logistics or data center business.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM.

m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.  The once mighty Grand Met is no more.","['FB', 'BRK.B', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'KO']"
m69ifj,,investing,post,1615902668,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['BLK', 'NDAQ', 'UPS']"

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

**[Recent 1Q21 Earnings](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/) - 02/03/21**

* Company-wide sales increased 105% to $748.6m in 1Q, driven by support in US Consumer and continued momentum in Hawthorne
* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.
Looking forward to discussing potential supports and counterarguments to this thesis.","['TGT', 'CTVA', 'CHD', 'CF', 'MOS']"

Hawthorne is in a very special position to capitalize on vertical integration on the cannabis cultivation equipment/fertilizer/nutrient market.

most people can liken this to the gold rush where yea some made it out filthy rich but many other miners went bust and the real smart guys were the ones selling shovels and gold pans.

I believe the same thing will happen in the green rush, SMG is the one selling more than 50-60% of the ""shovels"" on the shelfs in every hydro store across the country under multiple (read 40+ with some real big names like Gavita grow lights, General Hydroponics nutrients) brand names all under Hawthorne subsidiary.",
m6joep,gr7twnd,investing,comment,1615968944,Scott’s has been at the forefront of marketing innovation for a long time.  They are able to appeal to the vanity of their customers in the quest for a perfect lawn by selling upscale packaging and lawn photographs.  Being able to sell fertilizer for $20 a bag and dirt for $5 a bag is no easy task but they do it.  The problem is see here is transferring those skills to the marijuana play.  Marketing the way Scott’s does won’t work the same way and it may actually form part of the regulations that come out on legalization.

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

Q4 earnings miss GAAP EPS off by 7.7%.  FCF analysis puts fair value at $134.  DCF EPS even lower.

It doesn't matter that they had a strong quarter.  What matters is that they set an expectation with investors and missed it by almost 8% or 11.7 cents per share (~$311 million total) in a year where they had been beating earnings by double digit percentages and hadn't had an EPS miss since Q4 2020.  Prices were moving on that expectation and when it failed to materialize, investors penalized WMT.

This continues to further Graham and Buffett's view that stocks trading in excess of their fair value are more susceptible to downward pressure particularly when the market is pricing in earnings that don't materialize as expected.   It should be noted that Buffett doesn't ""buy the ... dip"".... He looks for securities that are trading well below their fair value, typically 30 to 50% below fair value rather than right on the cusp of it, regardless of price movements in relation to near-term highs.",['WMT']

m60b98,,investing,post,1615866531,"I have to be missing something about the EV spaceI have been in the markets since college, about 6 years ago. I am not an expert and have my fair share of misses. This isnt a typical ""doomsday"" post. In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players.","['TSLA', 'ICE', 'GM']"

m60b98,gr3r6j2,investing,comment,1615884824,"This was an honest question, and I will do my best at giving an honest, non-hype no BS answer as good practice to articulate my thoughts on the space. (*Disclaimer:* I could be defined as a mega-bull on the what I'll call broadly the 'electrification' opportunity that faces the world in the 1-2 coming **decades,** EVs being a big part of that). I'll start with my thoughts and then answer your questions. I also work in the space, and have been following it as an energy nerd for...a long time).

I would say **I am very concerned** about the 'EV froth' right now. With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

&#x200B;

I know its been long, but I hope it was worthy of the read. I can always write and share more if there are specific questions.

Edit: And answering your high level question about what you are missing, its that in my view and what I've seen, TSLA has been the one that has derisked a lot of the market and made the manufacturing progress (turning clearly cash flow positive forward looking as of January 2020....hmm) where they have crossed the chasm and are now on, a product manufacturing driven rocket ship. These other companies and the space have enjoyed the rising tides, hype, capital, and knowledge that it is possible. Then comes, the greed, the frauds, the bubble, and the damage. When the tide goes out, who will have no clothes? That is the core of what I think you might be missing about the space.","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

m6iaod,,investing,post,1615925770,"Dividends and performanceI had a question about dividends. If a company performs very well then their stock price will increase over the quarter. So when they give you dividends that means you are able to re-invest in less shares than if they would have given you the same dividends and they had performed less well. 

Am I understanding this correctly? I know that dividends are tied to performance so does that end up balancing out my scenario? I was specifically looking at some of the high dividend yield ETFs and this question popped up

Thanks!",

m6iaod,gr68so0,investing,comment,1615932832,"short answer: yes you are right.

&#x200B;

you buy 100 shares at $10 with 10% dividend and market cap of 10 thousand( and the outstanding shares are 1000) that means 

the dividend is is $1 per share with it you can buy 10 shares

if the price goes up to  $20 what would change?

well the market cap would change to 20 thousand but the outstanding shares stayed the same :(

but your dividend percentage would also change :( to 5%

so your dividend would be the (market cap \* the percentage) / the number of shares 1000) \* the amount of shares you own would be still be $100  woot same money!

but your purchasing power went down so now you can only buy 5 shares.",
m6iaod,gr5wuro,investing,comment,1615927239,"

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",
m6iaod,gr68t4c,investing,comment,1615932838,"The company decides what to do with their budget.   

Some spend all their money (wisely or not).  The goal is to grow the business,  build another factory, or buy more trucks or whatever.   Sometimes that means buy a smaller company.   If they grow wisely,  the value of the stock goes up.

Some try to grow, but slowly,  maybe there aren't any good opportunities at the time so they could buy back their stock with the extra cash.  This makes the value of the stock go up. 

Some return the money to the shareholders as dividends. 

You can find different combinations of these.  Some growing companies may periodically pay a one off special dividend. Others pay a small but routine dividend, and grow or buy back shares depending on opportunities.   Others just keep stable and pay most of the profits as dividends, and as the years roll on with inflation they will try to raise the dividend every year. 

Each of the attract different types of investors so they try to stick with a strategy. For example, retired people like to count on dividends as income so you see utilities finance growth with bonds and maintain the dividend because if they cut the dividend those people would all sell.  Cyclical companies pay dividends in good times and cut it in down cycles.",

**Introduction** 

During a casual scroll through the dregs of Robinhood, I stumbled upon a listing that caught my eye: Future Fintech ($FTFT), a China-based “blockchain e-commerce financial technology company” that’s up an impressive 455% over the past year. Featuring a market cap of \~$500m and share price of \~$5.50 (at the time of discovery), it appeared at first glance to be a player in a hot sector with plenty of room to run. I decided to do a deep-dive into their history, products, and SEC filings as an exercise in due diligence.  

What I found was bewildering – and a great lesson in why doing your own thorough research before investing is vital. Let’s take a look at what I found. 

**A Brief Company History** 

$FTFT wasn’t always a pioneer in one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. Before pivoting to blockchain, e-commerce and crypto in 2018, $FTFT produced and sold fruit juice - yes, seriously - as SkyPeople Foods Holding Ltd. (“SkyPeople”). The carcass of the company dates all the way back to 1998, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on their recent history. 

SkyPeople was brought onto the NASDAQ via secondary offering through underwriters Rodman & Renshaw (featured in the documentary *The China Hustle*), who have a history of bringing sketchy Chinese microcap companies to market and [violating Finra rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/finra-fines-rodman-renshaw-for-analysts-actions.html). Interestingly, SkyPeople settled a [$2.2m class action lawsuit](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf) (.pdf link) in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1,000%** and failing to disclose a **related-party transaction** involving their former CFO, Yongke Xue (now board chairman), to shareholders. 

According to their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm), the transition to their latest business focus hasn’t been going so well: “The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised **substantial doubts about its ability to continue** as a going concern” (pg. 7). As of September 30, 2020, positive operating cashflows were predominantly related to stock compensation and discontinued operations – not their stated core business (pg. 3). The quick ratio for their 3Q2020 financials (0.057) indicates that the company doesn’t have adequate liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities. 

  
Compounding their troubles is a **subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement** issued on February 21, 2020, addressing their accounting practices, management oversight, and the sale of one of their subsidiaries (pg. 16). Note that this critical piece of information is missing from their website’s [news page](http://ftft.top/en/news.html). 

Their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm) \- the last one filed with the SEC - details their routine, schizophrenic changes in name and business focus since 1998, as well as their suspiciously complicated and web-like organizational structure, portrayed on a [chart](https://imgur.com/PNFqHLj) (pg. 4) featuring font so small that it’s impossible to read.  

In addition to being an industry leader in juice production and blockchain technology, $FTFT is also an innovator in taking out loans, leases, and service contracts, defaulting on them, and getting slapped with judgements in court, boasting an impressive record of [**20 defaults and lawsuits**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006) in six years (2014-2019, pgs. 42-45).  Furthermore, they’ve regularly been in danger of being delisted by NASDAQ due to their **persistent failure to file reports on time** (pg. 40). 

Now that we’ve scratched the surface of this industry heavyweight’s complex history, let’s examine $FTFT’s products and services. 

**Blockchain, E-Commerce, and Crypto – Oh My!** 

According to $FTFT’s website, [www.ftft.top](http://www.ftft.top/), their core revenue generators revolve around blockchain-enabled e-commerce. We’ll take a brief, critical look at each of them below. 

**“Chain Cloud Mall”,** AKA “GK Shared Mall” ([www.gksharedmall.com](http://www.gksharedmall.com/)), is described on their website as an “...innovative B2B2C e-commerce platform created by well-known investment bankers, e-commerce and blockchain technology industry elites, financial technology experts, and sharing economy scholars."" In reality, it appears to be a standard, boring retail platform, absent of any evidence whatsoever that blockchain & fintech “experts” and “scholars” were involved in its creation, or that blockchain technology is even in place at all. It’s replete with dead links and has seemingly little engagement. In fact, according to their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm), it generated an abysmal **$0.54m** in revenue from a total of **6,401 users**. 

**“NONOGIRL”** is a “cross-border e-commerce platform” that, in reality, appears to be a standard-web auction site that was seemingly [abandoned 7 months ago](https://imgur.com/aH4B94h) according to the NONOGIRL LinkedIn page. It’s unclear if the site was ever launched; searches on [www.baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com/) and the Google Play Store return no direct results to the platform. 

**“DCON”** is a “blockchain-based application incubator and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets” that appears to be dead in the water, as [the associated coin never appears to have been released](https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R). No development updates are available on $FTFT’s website for either the “incubator” project or the DCON platform itself. 

**Conclusion** 

All publicly available evidence points toward this name being an incredibly risky investment with a hefty amount of downside looming overhead. Major red flags abound – and to those holding long positions in this company: **invest with caution**.

All SEC filings can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/ciks=0001066923&entityName=Future%2520FinTech%2520Group%2520Inc.%2520(FTFT)%2520(CIK%25200001066923)). Thanks for reading.","['GOOGL', 'NDAQ', 'PG', 'PM']"

The dividend cut likely took some shareholders by surprise. Ultimately I believe management will reinstate the dividend once the outlook for the covid pandemic clears. They have hinted at that in their regulatory filings, saying they will likely need to raise their distribution to higher levels.

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",['TGT']

m592rq,,investing,post,1615770312,"Equity-Based Dollar-Cost Averaging: Methodically Buying Dips and Taking Profits Anyone who spent some time studying the basics of investing knows about dollar-cost averaging. If anyone needs a refresher, here's a short analysis between lump-sum versus averaging by Vanguard: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum).

Vanguard makes a compelling case about market timing. Assuming a retail trader can't time the market (even if you don't support EMH, it still is obvious that this is pretty darn difficult), you may believe it's simply for those who are scared of realizing losses, which is exactly the point they make.

I would like to propose a slight tweak to the concept: instead of spreading the payments out over time, spread them out over price. You start with an initial exposure, and scale up when the market takes a hit, while scaling down to take profits during bull runs.

Let's demonstrate why this works out. Take a random price point the SPY has reached in the past: 250 USD. How many times did it reach this point? Five times. Take another one, 270 USD: **ten times.** How about 290 USD? **Fourteen times.** But maybe that's just a recent trend. Things might've been different back when it was around 100 USD, right? Nope, **ten times it reached 100 USD.**

I haven't conducted an elaborate backtest, but it's clear the amount of setbacks to any particular price level is rather large, just as it's clear the whole thing is positively drifting in general.

Given that we know this, instead of investing 100% at once, consider what would happen if you invested 60% at 100 USD and invested an extra 20% for every 10% drawdown, and scaled down by 5% for every 10% increase? In other words, we scale up by double the drawdown, and realize half of our profits.

Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash. We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

We could continue to test and demonstrate this, but the point is clear; we all know this will generate less returns in a very strong bull market, and create very strong opportunities in bear markets. We profit when bull runs are facing continous corrections, when the market goes sideways with some swings in between, and we are extremely well-protected against crashes, able to purchase lows and hold whole multiples of shares compared to when we'd just lump-sum.

It's no coincidence the greats such as Warren Buffet hold so much of their available capital in cash and play the waiting game on crashing markets. Ask yourself: when the markets crashed by 50+% over the course of their history, did it ever correspond with a similar collapse of the global economy? Not really, jobs were lost, consumer spending took a hit, some companies went under, but at a global scale we never took a hit even in the same universe as the rate at which the market tanks during those times.

So what's your take on this? Is this even considered ""dollar-cost averaging""? Are there superior alternatives? Or would you consider / are you already applying this in your actual investment strategies? Would very much like to further my knowledge on this topic.",

Today I´m bringing you all my third D&D. There will be no technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some information research and maybe you find it helpful. 

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

Before you ask, I currently hold 3652 shares at an average cost of 2.32.

**About the company:**

Sesen Bio is a late-stage company developing fusion protein medicines. Their fusion protein approach tethers a tumor-targeting antibody fragment to a protein cytotoxic payload to form a single protein molecule designed to selectively and broadly kill cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells and to activating the body’s innate immune response system.

**What are they doing and why I think it´s important:**

The company is initially focused on the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Their main drug is it’s called **Vicineum.** This is being evaluated in the [**Phase 3 VISTA** trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02449239?term=vicinium&rank=1) for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have been previously treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the current standard of care for NMIBC. While BCG is effective in many patients, challenges with tolerability have been observed and many patients will experience recurrence of the disease. If BCG is not effective or a patient can no longer receive BCG, the recommended option for treatment is radical cystectomy, the complete removal of the bladder.

*In case you ask how many people are vaccinated with the BCG feel free to click this link:* [*http://www.bcgatlas.org/*](http://www.bcgatlas.org/)*.*

The preliminary findings are highly encouraging, demonstrating that treatment with Vicineum results in clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability. In addition, the data are consistent with the results of Vicineum in their completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

**Vicineum** can potentially treat **head and neck cancer.** They have completed Phase 1 trials for an injectable form of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN that have demonstrated anti-tumor activity and safety. Data from these trials also demonstrated that certain patients who were injected with Vicineum in one tumor had responses in non-injected tumors as well, suggesting that Vicineum may promote an anti-tumor immune response and combine well with immunotherapies. In addition to the Phase 1 trials, Sesen Bio completed a Phase 2 trial in the United States, which demonstrated a reduction in the bidirectional size of the principle targeted tumor observed in 71 percent (10/14) of patients evaluated in the study.

**Some important fact about Bladder Cancer:**

\- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. If BCG is not effective one of the options is **complete bladder removal.** Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer, but options for treatment have not changed in more than 20 years. At Sesen Bio, they want to help you save your bladder. **Vicineum**™, is administered in the exact same way as BCG but works differently and may offer a new option.

\- This year, an estimated 83,730 adults (64,280 men and 19,450 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Smoking accounts for 47% of all these cases.

\- Bladder cancer mostly affects older people. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are older than 55. The average age people are diagnosed with bladder cancer is 73.

\- The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The general 5-year survival rate for people with bladder cancer is 77%. If the tumor is invasive but has not yet spread outside the bladder, the 5-year survival rate is 69%. Approximately 33% of bladders cancers are diagnosed at this stage.

**My opinion on all this:**

Vicineum appears to be the new great thing around bladder cancer, numbers are showing to be great and this is close to receiving an FDA response which is expected to be positive. This is the 6th most common cancer and if the BCG fails the most common treatment is bladder removal. Sesen is trying to avoid this by providing a great solution. The company is partnered around the world to provide this once approved and is aiming beyond the USA. The balance sheet looks impeccable, no debt, 44M free, indicators look great for the short, mid, and long-range with a huge upside on a price target. 

I see this having some big news soon and driving the price very high up. 

Another important thing is that there are not many videos or spam around it so the price isn´t pumped in my opinion. 

There is a BCG shortage which might help Sesen Bio get their drug approved even faster. This shortage has been going for some years now. 

I will not buy more shares as I already own a lot but I see this as a great investment.

For my entire portfolio, plus a few dollars/share here, minus a few dollars/share there, not really any reasoning for any of it, but definitely an overall much lower total cost basis than actually should have been there.

If you haven’t left Robinhood yet, get out. This kind of technical incompetence isn’t just embarrassing, it’s scary. You don’t want to keep your money in a clown car.

Edit: For those saying they never received cost basis, note that I only received mine more than a full month later and after I sold some shares - the transfers went through on 2/5-2/8 and I got a statement indicating cost basis was updated on 3/10 for shares which I'd sold (and cost basis information appeared on all other shares). Somehow the date in the cost basis is correct on Vanguard, but the amounts are wonky (roughly the date of the transfer, but the purchase date is correct for some, for others random values). For example, 4 shares of EA came through as 141.50, but my entire history with RH only has one purchase for 147.25 - https://imgur.com/a/GwvQRSH","['PSA', 'EA']"

# Understanding the eVTOL Space

(Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag)

Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a moo*o* point.

Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the *same per mile as a ground-based ride share*.

Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check [this article](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/evtol-air-taxi-flying-car-market-players/) to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) *or* are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded [DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lwj8rs/a_world_of_evtols_a_comparison_of/) that I highly recommend checking out.

The United States is acutely aware that it ['missed the boat'](https://www.osinto.com/post/agility-prime-the-pentagon-s-evtol-power-play) on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the [Department of Defense.](https://dod.defense.gov/) Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched **Agility Prime**, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their [website](https://agilityprime.com/index.html?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=AgilityPrime#/) here and highly recommend reading this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-flying-cars-could-take-off-soon-if-we-let-the-military-help/) by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from *the Jetsons.*

The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a **TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM**, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario.

Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at **$1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S**. Joby Aviation cited the [2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/bah-uam-executive-briefing-to-post.pdf) for its forecasts.

Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities:

1. **Batteries!!** \- Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's *ludicrous* mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. [Alakai Skai](https://www.skai.co/)'s (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services
2. **Certification** \- These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause.
3. **Safety** \- To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. *It will be complicated to write software* to reliably control all that, [says Ella Atkins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/02/10/lilium-evtol-spac-air-taxi/?sh=33d80b54627c), an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. *“You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,”* says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone.
4. **Air Traffic Control** \- Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of *skyports/ vertiports* dotted around an urban area.
5. **Public Perception** \- Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, *“*[*lasing*](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws/)*”* of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only.

All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space:

1. **Joby Aviation - $RTP** (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play)
2. **Blade - $EXPC** (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play)

# Outlook for EXPC and RTP

**Blade - EXPC**

[Investor's presentation](https://brs-apartments.flyblade.com/blade/production/uploaded-assets/1608040247.pdf)

* **Blade is an eVTOL index play**, often thought as the *""*[*Uber of skies*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-small-aviation-tech-company-will-turn-into-the-uber-of-the-skies-2021-01-11)*""* operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform.
* **Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable**; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products.
* There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to ***selling shovels in a gold rush.***
* Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. **This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow**.”
* **Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities** that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent).
* **Blade operates in four key lines of business:**
   * *Short Distance* – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders).
   * *BLADE Airport* – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 .
   * *BLADE MediMobility* – **Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States**, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers.
   * *International Joint Ventures* – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. **Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India** flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi.
   * The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo).
* **Blade's projected revenue outlook**:
   * Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million.
   * Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. **This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026**. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then.
   * But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt)
* **Blade's Competitive Moat**:
   * **BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility.**
   * **#1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets**, brings credibility to new market expansion.
   * **Strong management team with domain expertise** and public market experience.
   * **BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies** to generate attractive growth opportunities.
   * Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables **flight volume growth** and **accelerates launch timeline for new markets**
   * While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and **it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost** (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.
* **ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares**, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares.
* **Leadership:** Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.
* **Board of Directors** upon completion of transaction:
   * Eric Affeldt, Chief Executive Officer of Experience Investment Corp. and previously CEO of publicly-traded ClubCorp
   * Jane Garvey, former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

# What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth

**Blade - EXPC**

* PF shares outstanding: **82.5 million**
* EXPC SP as of 03/14: **$12.9**
* SPAC Cash = $375MM
* 82.5MM \* $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap
* PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash)
* Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is **7.4x.** On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers.
* Unadjusted:
   * 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be **$402MM** (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number).
   * This means that the **unadjusted** **EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales**. That is very low.
   * This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$3.35 billion**.
   * That is **215%** **above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61**
* Adjusted:
   * We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The **present value sales number is $230 million** (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%).
   * As a result, the **adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x** (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million).
   * This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$2.077 billion**.
   * That is **95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2**
* Average between adjusted and unadjusted:
   * Target market value is $2.713 billion.
   * **Fair share price: $32.89**

**Conclusion:** ***EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9*** *(As of 03/14/2021)*

This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement.

**Joby - RTP (Speculation)**

* It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.)
* Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of *saving a billion people an hour a day.*
* Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months.
* Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months.
* ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category.

# How I am playing EXPC and RTP

* Catalysts:
   * ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play
   * EXPC - A lot of spec predictions [floating around](https://mobile.twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1368222379080638467) about the shareholder vote on 3/31
   * Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound.
* Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow.
* I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well.
* Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting.

**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor**, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

In other words, I think this space has a lot of potential to become something of a future bubble / hype sector, but also become a very real and profitable space as well. I like the long term potential of EVTOL more than electric cars since I believe there will be far better moats here with a lot less competition. Also has some potential for future crossover with defense industry.

Not saying I would go whole hog on this, but I picked up some warrants as a speculative play on RTX after the SPAC shares crashed back to being close to the initial $10 value.  In my view, the long-term warrants (expire in 2027) present an opportunity for a LOT of upside, where the downside is not necessarily that high.

In other words, I think that ***right now,*** the risk assymetry is heavily skewed to the upside.

That being said, unless WSB catches onto hype in this sector, I'm not sure I would want to play these short term. I would not buy options on these here personally. Overall, I think the macro headwinds to growth stocks is going to be a little bit tough over the next  few quarters. It'll probably help that these are small caps, but I still think these are best viewed as speculative long term call options on a potential new disruptive technology.",['RTX']

Through this latest phase, the company has invested in additional options that allow shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

Schneider has expanded its technology lineup of Schneider FreightPower, first announced mid-year 2020, to help shippers save time and increase their access to capacity. The company rolled out the accompanying app to carriers in Fall 2020.

Through this latest phase, Schneider FreightPower aims to provide shippers with options to manage their businesses right at their fingertips. The digital marketplace allows shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

“Our goal is to make Schneider FreightPower the digital access point for services and solutions for both shippers and carriers,” said Mark Rourke, president and CEO of Schneider. “Shippers of all sizes come to us with their toughest transportation challenges, and we are solving them faster than ever before. That means our customers get more value – and get more done in a day.”

Schneider FreightPower offers access to tools such as:Instantly quote and bookFreight visibility 24/7 (load in process, last location, pickup and ETA), including email notifications (pickups, deliveries, and specific order completion)Access to load documentsReal-time reporting


“Schneider FreightPower is an exciting, new way to differentiate Schneider and connect to small shippers and carriers which represent a $1.2 trillion segment of the transportation market,” said Rourke. “We are giving shippers time, solutions and the best at what we deliver— access to full Schneider capabilities and options. It’s all about improving capacity, so shippers can do business better than ever before,” said Rourke.

**$IGIC (commons) & $IGICW (warrants)**

* Growing at 31% YoY
* Extremely Moaty Specialty Insurance Business
* Family-owned company (\~29% of outstanding shares)
* No debt
* Not affected negatively by Covid (so not dependent upon reopening)
* Specialized insurance (high profit margins)
* Insurance rates are the highest they've ever been (we're seeing 20-30% gains in premiums)
* Profitable
* 20 Year old business
* Founder still very active in the company (he's 87)
* Pays a dividend
* $380m in cash (their M.C. is $345m CRAZY)
* Repurchasing shares
* Has warrants (they're a 1-1 with an $11.50 Strike)

They mainly write insurance in the Middle East (Jabsheh family is well respected and are a real value add. However they've recently added N.A. and did 30m in premiums last quarter).

**Company History:**

I spoke to IR (investor relations) she said she won't leave the company until she fixes the volume problem. She's the only employee that's worked for a public company, so the old guard is a bit difficult to talk with. The owner is a big baller, he's worth 100m all from the company. Started it 20 years ago, he's 87 and still goes to work everyday. You can set up a investor call with him at 8pm at night (his time), you'll catch him smoking a cigar and drinking scotch. Fucking chad.

**So what's the problem?**

A couple of things... $IGIC went public via a SP4C on March 22nd, 2020. The SPAC offering was at \~$10 the market Armageddon that ensued caused them to drop below $7 and they've traded sideways since then. The original investors (Argo Group being the largest one) would like to exit their position but they are unable to for 2 reasons.

1. Lockup period ends in March, it's any day now that the SP4C lockup ends.
2. They won't sell at a loss. Until this thing moves above $10 you won't see a real marketplace exist for it... This stock needs liquidity and we can provide that to create a real marketplace for it.

**Let's talk fundamentals are valuations...**

These types of business' are valued on their book. Let's take a look at where $IGIC stands relative to it's competitors.

As you can see $IGIC is trading a multiple of .87x price-to-book relative to $KNSL which is 10.15x price-to-book. $IGIC is growing almost as quickly as $KNSL. $IGIC is profitable, in it for the long run, growing quickly, and way underappreciated.

**Conservative PT:** $12 or \~1.5x price-to-book

**PT:** $30 or \~4x price-to-book

**Bullcase PT:** \~$70 or \~10x price-to-book

As you can see this is anywhere from a 2 bagger to a 10 bagger. I am very long $IGIC and am excited for the liquidity and volume issues to be resolved. When this has a real marketplace this stock will move... quickly.

**Positions:**

25,000 commons @ $7.5

10,000 warrants @ $.72",['IR']

m4y0mb,,investing,post,1615738368,"Why I think Mohawk Group Holdings ($MWK) is a Great Long Term Play.Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool ""AIMEE"" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and increasing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.

Some of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6

In a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&G, Unilever, etc.).

To put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become ""Super Heros"" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the financials:

Currently at the price of $35\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.

While the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&A targets. Direct quote from earnings:

*""We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&A targets that in total have trailing twelve month’s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month’s EBITDA of $97 million.""*

These deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.

I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.

&#x200B;

It is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:

1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them
2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution
3. Competitors

For the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.

On the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.

To the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.

It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality.","['WMT', 'AMZN']"

m4ghin,,investing,post,1615672644,"Long commodities, short bonds. Protection against inflation, and the house of cards that is the US bond market.Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

[https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc](https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc) 

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

The article talks about how since trading fees are so low, and it’s easier than ever to own one share, why not buy shares one at a time. It posed the idea of a mini-index fund that you could make just for yourself. *Rather than buy SPY, just buy one share of each of its components*. I always thought the idea novel when you consider the diseconomies of scale in the asset management industry. So I decided to test out the idea with backtesting.

\-I’ll be testing the mini-index fund strategy with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI)

\-I’ll be using DIA as the comparable passive instrument.

\-Using QuantConnect as my backtesting environment.

\-To simulate round-trip trading costs, I liquidate holdings at end of all backtests.

\-To further try to simulate real-world conditions, all backtests will have some excess cash, but not too much as if a real person was funding an investment account to buy something they already thought out. For example, if you want to buy one share of DIA at $286.00 you might deposit $300.00 in your account. Or if you need $4873.00 to buy one share of all the constituents of the DJI, you might round off your deposit at $4900.00.

\- All buying happened at the start of the backtesting period. A more realistic scenario to mimic small retail investors would be progressive buying as time goes on.

\- Fees are based on the IBKR brokerage model, NOT INCLUDING IBKR LITE. I would like to simulate zero-fee trading, but the trick with that is that I’d have to account for costs associated with the sometimes less than optimal trade execution that is known to occur with “free” brokerages. And those costs are hard to measure.

\- I did not use a price-weighting allocation yet. What I would do next is see how an exact copy of the DIA would perform.

\- My Backtest period is not that long. Less than a year. It starts 8-31-20 because that is the date when the DJI components last changed and ends on 3-13-21. If I wanted to spend some money on a data source that provides constituent information on indices, I could make the backtest period longer. There are ways to get that info without paying, but I’m only an amateur at python.

\- DJA is very limited, I’d rather do this test on the S&P500. Once again, need a clean data source to do that without a whole lot of headaches.

&#x200B;

The Results

[Backtest 1 (Benchmark) - 1 share of DIA](https://imgur.com/WYlJjAt)

Here we have the performance of just one share of DIA. I ran a full backtest on the benchmark because I wanted to see the effects of fees and cash drag on performance. Since we dealing with such low quantities a few dollars from either of those would have a meaningful effect. So the number to beat is 12.5%.

[Backtest 2 - 100 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/aOl8qQ5)

For the first backtest I just want to simply see what adding some scale to the portfolio would do. So instead of 1 share of DIA, we have 100. Sure enough, we got more than a whole percentage point in return. Nothing too surprising. The new number to beat: 13.83%.

[Backtest 3 - 1 share of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/syP1yos)

Now we created a portfolio with simply 1 share of every DJI constituent. Its return is very close to the return from Backtest 1 which was 12.5%. I suspect that if you did this strategy with a zero-commission account you might actually beat the 1-share DIA strategy. By how much, hard to say. However, still would be a losing strategy when compared to 100-shares DIA.

[Backtest 4 - 10 shares of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/h2teIea)

Same idea with Backtest 2. I want to see how adding a little scale would change things. Sure enough, performs very closely to Backtest 2 – 100 shares of DIA strategy. Doesn’t beat it, but I suspect it might in a zero-fee environment by just a small amount. Of course, this is also the strategy that requires the most capital to implement just to buy all the pieces. So, it wouldn’t be the most practical strategy for most people.

[Backtest 5 - 1000 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/lVxwWnp)

Since Backtest 2 performed the best, I wanted to see the effect of even adding more scale, this time with 1000 shares. No doubt we have some diminishing returns. We were able to eke out just 1 basis point for an extra 300k of capital.

**Conclusions:**

Based on what I’m seeing, there doesn’t seem to much of a case for the Mini-Index Fund strategy. You’re still better off with just the proper ETF. Not ready to close the book on this just yet. Given time, I would like to test certain conditions that might have the Mini-Index Fund Strategy win at the end.","['DOW', 'PGR', 'SPGI']"

m4qnp9,,investing,post,1615707348,"AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader# Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $210 Million
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion.","['FB', 'ORCL', 'PEG', 'PH', 'CARR']"

That gives some good information on the company. Basically, it is extremely undervalued right now. Here are what analysts are saying

A number of equities analysts have issued reports on the stock. Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Berkeley Lights from a ""buy"" rating to a ""hold"" rating in a research report on Tuesday, February 2nd. JPMorgan Chase & Co. boosted their price objective on shares of Berkeley Lights from $75.00 to $100.00 and gave the company an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Friday, November 13th. Morgan Stanley boosted their price objective on shares of Berkeley Lights from $65.00 to $80.00 and gave the company an ""equal weight"" rating in a research report on Monday, November 16th. Finally, Stifel Nicolaus assumed coverage on shares of Berkeley Lights in a research report on Tuesday, January 26th. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $105.00 price objective on the stock. Two investment analysts have rated the stock with a hold rating and five have issued a buy rating to the stock. The stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $92.20.

Berkeley Lights stock opened at $54.24 on Friday. The firm has a fifty day simple moving average of $70.09 and a two-hundred day simple moving average of $82.62. Berkeley Lights has a twelve month low of $47.28 and a twelve month high of $113.53.

m4cmv8,,investing,post,1615661573,"A look into Chinas digital health market - to make a case for Ping An Good DoctorTL;DR: The digital health market especially in China has a huge growth potential in the next decade and Ping An Good Doctor is the company to go to if you want to invest in this market. 

**Who is Ping An Good Doctor?**

Established in 2014 and listed on the Hong King Stock Exchange in April 2018 **Ping An Good Doctor**, formerly known as **Ping An Healthcare and Technology,** is a health care software company. The Company offers a mobile platform for online consultations, hospital referrals and appointments, health management, and wellness interaction services. In addition, it connects individual consumers with health care resources. Ping An Healthcare and Technology is headquartered in Shanghai, China. Its parent company Ping An is the world largest insurance company in terms of assets and market capitalization

**What is the growth potential of the Digital Health market?**

The global Digital Health market is expected to witness a 37.1% spike in growth in the year 2021 and [thereafter will continue to grow and reach US$508.8 billion by the year 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/25/2133473/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Report-2020-Market-is-Expected-to-Witness-a-37-1-Spike-in-Growth-in-2021-and-will-Continue-to-Grow-and-Reach-US-508-8-Billion-by-2027.html), trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 18.8% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. Non-COVID-19 healthcare has massively migrated to digital platforms in 2020. From telemedicine to remote patient monitoring & management, new service delivery platforms have been adopted at lightning speeds.

The global telemedicine market size was estimated at USD 55.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a [CAGR of 22.4% from 2021 to 2028.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/telemedicine-industry) The market holds many opportunities to grow during the forecast period owing to the lack of access to care and rising provider adoption of telemedicine, rising consumer demand and patient acceptance, and enhanced quality of care. 

Especially in China the sharp growth for the online healthcare sector is expected to continue in the following years. [Ping An Healthcare has quoted industry](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) estimates in its FY 2020 results presentation slides, which suggest that the penetration rate of online medical services in China could potentially expand from 5% in 2020 to 16% in 2025. This implies that Ping An Healthcare's online medical services business has a long growth runway ahead.

**Why Ping An Good Doctor?**
**Rapid User Growth** 

The company [grew rapidly in 2020](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF). As of December 31, 2020 Ping An Good Doctor had 373 million registered users (+18% YoY), 72.62 million Monthly Active Users (+8.5% YoY), 3.98 million monthly paying users (+34.1% YoY) and average daily consultations reaching 903,000 (+23.9 YoY) with network coverage including 3,700+ hospitals and 151,000 collaborated pharmacy outlets in 379 cities in 32 provinces. 

**Good Financial results in 2020**

Ping An Good Doctors[financial performance was good](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year with strong top line growth, improved profitability at the gross margin level, and narrowing losses.

The company's revenue increased by +36% YoY from RMB5,065 million in FY 2019 to RMB6,866 million in FY 2020. In terms of profitability, Ping An Healthcare's gross profit margin expanded by +410 basis points from 23.1% in FY 2019 to 27.2% in FY 2020. Furthermore, Ping An Good Doctor\`s net loss adjusted for share option expenses and foreign exchange, was reduced from -RMB695 million in FY 2019 to -RMB516 million in FY 2020.

**Who is the competition?**

This puts Ping An Healthcare as one of the three major Chinese internet healthcare companies alongside Alibaba Health Information Technology Limited (OTCPK:ALBHF) \[241:HK\] and JD Health International Inc (OTCPK:JDHIF) (OTCPK:JDHIY) \[6688:HK\]. Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (OTCPK:PNGAY) (OTCPK:PIAIF) \[2318:HK\] is Ping An Healthcare's parent with a 38.4% equity interest, while Alibaba Health Information Technology and JD Health are backed by Alibaba Group (BABA) and JD.com (JD), respectively.

**Ping An Good Doctor profits more from the digital health market than its competitor.** [23 %](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) of Ping An Good Doctors revenue came from its online medical services segment (compared to 17% in 2019) and 47% of its Gross profit (+15 pps YoY) In contrast, Alibaba Health generated approximately [97%](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/alihealth/interim/2021/int.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of the company's 1H FY 2021 (YE March 31) revenue from pharmaceutical direct sales & e-commerce businesses, while sales for the pharmaceutical retail business (including direct and third-party platform) represented [94%](https://files.services/files/586/2020/1126/20201126070002_75568423_en.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of JD Health's 1H 2020 revenue.

In other words, Ping An Good Doctor\`s is a better proxy for the growth of online medical services in China, while Alibaba Health and JD Health are seen as plays on the country's pharmaceutical retail industry.

Notably, Ping An Good Doctor\`s online medical services business segment saw +82% YoY revenue growth last year, which was much higher than the company's overall top line growth and the sales growth of its other business segments. This validates my view with regards to the growth potential of the online medical services industry in China.

It is also noteworthy that the company's online medical services business led the improvement in gross profitability. The gross profit margin of Ping An Healthcare's online medical services improved by +12.0 percentage points YoY to [56.2%](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year.

A favorable revenue mix with an increased sales contribution from higher-margin online medical services drove Ping An Healthcare's overall gross profit margin expansion in FY 2020. In comparison, the company's health management & wellness interaction segment saw YoY declines in gross margin in FY 2020.

**What are the risks?**

**Chinese market as a risk**

While investing in Chinese companies you must keep in mind that even tough the state leaves many companies alone, provided they don´t get involved in politics, the recently cancelled IPO of Ant Financial serves as a reminder that the government can do whatever it wants. Changes in regulatory policies could be negative for Chinese internet health care player. 

Also, Chinese companies saw some red days recently due to speculation that the government might now be able to maintain such high levels of Covid stimulus. But this would only have a short-term effect on the stock. 

**Market risks**

Certain challenges faced by this industry are resistance in technology acceptance by practitioners and patients, high cost of implementation, and data privacy and safety issues. These factors may hamper the accelerating growth to a certain extent. 

**Company risks**

Even though Ping An Good Doctor grew rapidly over the last year it’s never been profitable. This is expected to change within the next couple of years but a longer-than-expected time for the company as a whole and its online medical services business to be profitable poses a risk.

**Is it a good time to buy now?** 

After ARK Investments Management revealed that the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF initiated a new position in Ping An Good Doctor, a $ 3 Billion price surge was sparked but short lived. Right now the price is back to normal and Cathie bought 1 Million more shares on Thursday. As this being a longterm investment I don’t think that there is a need to rush in the stock. I believe it\`s at its fair value at the moment and something to keep an eye on and on the Watchlist.

&#x200B;

If you are not familiar with the company, they are an Australia-based online custom print-on-demand marketplace, (selling to the US and UK/EU predominantly), which in my opinion was very well positioned at the beginning of the pandemic, which gave it even more momentum forward.

I personally use them both as a customer and as a seller and am well impressed with both the seller interface and the quality of the goods. I got super interested now that the company posted their half-year report (apparently they don't do quarterlies at ASX) , which is the best in their history. +96% revenue growth, pre-tax profit up 118%, went long after I read it and the price dropped

Here are my views on Redbubble

PROS:

* ZERO debt - £130m cash balance
* 36% insider ownership (before CEO purchase)
* CEO spends 2 million AUD to buy shares after Feb earnings report (1.6m on loan, 400k out of pocket)
* Record braking HY report, all I see is growth and potential
* Operating expenses only up 23% vs 96% revenue growth, so they are becoming more efficient
* Massive affiliate marketing that seems to have traction // I DO mean massive if you search for passive income on Youtube, I bet some of the top hits will tell you to sell on Redbubble
* Actually making profit // first year of profit posted in the report, 42m vs -2m
* good market interface for both sellers and buyers // with good quality merchandise
* great customer experience and reviews
* Still relatively small 1.6B cap, a lot of room for growth IMO
* CEO said they won't pay dividends but reinvest everything for growth

CONS:

* Price of stock grew significantly since the 2020 bottom
* You might be exposed to multiple currencies - Their base is in AUD but predominantly sell in USD,GBP,EUR
* Price slid after the earnings report and positive outlook from CEO (WTF?), maybe anticipation was even higher?
* Trades @ ASX so might not be accessible for everyone. Market sentiment might also be different

Morgan Stanley had been quietly buying up 5% for a Japanese bank from October to mid-Feb. Not sure if this has any significance

m4dnp3,gr19ic9,investing,comment,1615829944,"Here are my major concerns with Redbubble.

\-It's a copyright disaster waiting to happen. Independent artists constantly have their design / brands ripped with bootleg merch. While these people have limited ability to fight against Redbubble (removing designs is a hassle, commission is already in the pocket of the thief, and many artists don't even know that their designs are up on the site), seeing that anybody from anywhere can upload any design, lawsuits from big brands is inevitable. Most of the designs that Redbubble recommends are recognizable logos, characters, movies, etc (namely from Disney).

\-Way too much competition. The influx of on demand printing is a huge issue for Redbubble, as it has nothing to differentiate itself from the other sites. It isn't cheaper than competitors, it doesn't have better quality products, but it is quick and easy. 

\-New artists and bots will flood the market with designs. While this doesn't negatively impact Redbubble directly, quantity will go up and quality will go down. Many artists have a hard time beating the recommended algorithm already, and have to rely solely on outside traffic. Not to mention the site's review system is flawed by having reviews being delegated to products rather than designs. This isn't healthy for an ecosystem of artists. 

&#x200B;

I do think on demand products / printing is the way of the future, but I don't have much faith in Redbubble specifically. It's just one of the many average options (except this one will be sued into oblivion if it gains steam).",

**Excerpt:** The economy did collapse back then, but the government did not blow its brains out on fiscal largesse. So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?

**Tl;dr:** There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade.

I'm not prone to being particularly for or against, but this is starting to look more like snake oil to me, despite making money off of it in the past directly or indirectly. Please understand I'm looking for alternative perspectives, and thank you in advance.

It doesn't seem to represent a good value store, to which it's proponents then turn around and say, it doesn't matter, its not that! Nor does it permit trading like a currency, given its sometimes wild volatility (how much am I paying for that pizza anyway), to which it's proponents again reassure me, don't worry, it's not that! Lastly, the hedge against a falling dollar/failing monetary policy argument - I don't see how a system to replace a fiat currency but which radically benefits original holders, meanwhile removing some of the variability of economic policy available today will be beneficial, and I can already foresee the argument of - oh but 'the man' devalues our dollar with monetary policy right now as he sees fit, but so too does the volatility of the asset as it trades.

So if it's none of them, what exactly is it we are after and speculating on? To me it seems we are saying that we value the asset for the anonymity as a vehicle of transfer between two people and the ultimate conversion (and valuation versus) a fiat currency that it brings, and perhaps the 'trust' we have all along the chain. I don't think we can go as far as stating it is quicker or more efficient than existing payment mechanisms.

My wife and I live in the US, are 36 years of age, have one child with a combined gross income of $220,000.  We both max out our 401K to the IRS maximum, have three months savings in a high yield savings account and just recently paid off all our debt except for our home which is at 2.875%.  After overhead and saving for our son's college fund, we have a few grand left over every month.  

We recently opened up a brokerage account which we put these surplus funds into so it does something other than looking for fun things that we don't need.  If we decide to travel or need to make a ""major"" purchase our plan is not to dip into these funds but rather not contribute for X months.  

Depending on how things go, we may use these funds to purchase a second home (rental) however if the market tanks, we just won't do that.  As such, we believe our risk tolerance is pretty high.

Right now our portfolio consists primarily of VOO (80%) with a little of QQQ (6%), DIS (6%) and ARKK (2%).  The last 6% are what we consider our fun picks (AMC, CNBS, RBLX).

Our plan is to keep this strategy, depositing surplus every month, into our brokerage account with 80% of it being VOO or QQQ and the last 20% between DIS (my wife's pick), ARKK or other stocks/ETFs that we might think are worth putting money in.

As someone that has been doing this for approximately 9 months, I am looking for any feedback that you may have.  

Again, thank you in advance for your advice.","['ARKK', 'DIS']"
m43dkq,gqsyefi,investing,comment,1615648120,"So I’ve been thinking a lot about dividend vs growth investing and I think I’ve come to settle on dividend investing as the superior option. 

My reasoning is that even during periods of economic stagnation or even decline, that you’re still getting that dividend. Sure, it may be cut a bit, but you’re actively getting “gains” when the market isn’t going up. Isn’t this preferable to a situation where with growth stocks you will see absolutely no return, even losses, during the same periods? 

Another reason is that if you lose your job, you can redirect your dividends to your checking account and live off of that without needing to sell any of your base capital. 

To me dividend investing seems like the better risk management move as you are better off in stagnant or declining periods.",

**$LYTS - LSI Industries Inc. - Ever Been to a Gas Station - Bullish**

**What do they do**

* Based in Cleveland, OH, LSI makes industrial and outdoor lighting systems and accessories. These systems include gas station lighting and display/control systems (touch screens); outdoor sports lighting; and retail lighting systems.
* All products are made in the US which is an important moat for those sectors that require a Made in America designation such as federal contracts.
* The company was founded in 1976 and has grown through acquisitions to offer a broad and complete range of products and services for illumination and branding. As infrastructure spending increases and new developments flourish, both direct uses in retail and sports spaces and ancillary uses in gas stations/road stops will bolster LSI’s business.

**Why is it a good company**

* Improved margins last four quarters
* Doubled ROA and ROE YoY
* High OCF to Earnings ratio; real cash, not accounting
* Earnings growth QoQ; 100% increase YoY
* Decreased debt last eight quarters; debt coverage increased YoY
* Book equity has increased eight straight quarters.
* Enterprise value is less than the market cap

**Why is it a good stock**

* Greater than 90% free float; largest owner at \~8.5%
* Second quartile for momentum/price change: it’s rising but not topping at the moment
* Higher div yield than peers; in line with SPY
* 3 year smoothed FCF yield is 11.5% > WACC: good value looking at a longer time horizon
* P/B lower than peers with better fundamental improvement compared to peers

**What now**

* Long $LYTS with a PT of 12.5; EV/FCF based at 16x T12 FCF
* Write July calls at 12.50, IV = 48% on the bid

**What are you not telling me**

* Pretty low volume: 90 day average = 106k
* New management in the last 3 years might not have navigated the company through a full market cycle
* A slow down in infrastructure spending would negatively impact their profitability

*Data from company website, Refinitiv, and Yahoo! Finance*",

m477a4,,investing,post,1615645263,"MeaTech, first publicly traded cultivated meat company, just launched $25 Million IPOFigured this was worth posting for anyone interested in the future of traditional meat alternatives:

[MeaTech Announces $25 Million US Initial Public Offering & Approval For Nasdaq Listing](https://vegconomist.com/trade/meatech-announces-25-million-us-initial-public-offering-approval-for-nasdaq-listing/)

First publicly traded company in this sector, they're using 3D printing technology to create high-end cultured meats such as steak. They create their own cells and meat tissue for this process. In December they acquired Piece of Meat, a cultured fat technology company, and said their first product could be on the market as early as 2022.

I see huge growth in this sector over the next few years. We've all heard about lab grown meat, usually in jest from news stories making light of it. But as years pass it's becoming increasingly clear that this is going to be a real and expansive market. Reports about the environmental urgency created by animal agriculture continue to pile up, and plant-based options have exploded in popularity over the past few years as well - but are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Products like this will be key in filling that gap and transitioning our food system away from current conventional models, by providing options to those not interested in plant-based alternatives. Cultivating meat also opens up a massive door in the future to addressing food scarcity issues.

MeaTech however launched to very little fanfare. Here's some info [ripped from Seeking Alpha:](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3672241-lab-grown-meat-company-meatech-3d-to-open-on-nasdaq-after-mixed-ipo#comments)

* Lab-grown meat firm MeaTech 3D (MITC) sank as much as 23.8% in its first trading day following a U.S. IPO as investors found the Israeli start-up’s stock less than appetizing.
* MeaTech fell to as low as $7.85 in early Nasdaq trading, way down from its $10.30 initial public offering. Shares beefed up some later in the session, but closed at $10 a share, down 2.9% lower on the day.
* MeaTech had a mixed IPO that saw it sell more American Depositary Shares than expected, but at a weak $10.30-a-share price.
* On one hand, the company sold 2.4M ADSs, well above the 1.7M that it originally offered. However, the company had originally expected to sell shares at $15.10 apiece.
* Still, the combination of more shares at a lower price meant the IPO raised about $25M, which was MeaTech’s original target.
* The firm also granted underwriters the option to buy 364,000 additional ADSs for overallotments.
* Each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares in the company, which already trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker “MEAT” and U.S. OTC market as “MTTCF.”
* MEAT fell 5.8% in Tel Aviv on Thursday ahead of the U.S. IPO, while MTTCF lost 17.2% Friday to close at $1.20. That took the company’s market cap down to about $97.2M.
* MeaTech is developing three-dimensional printers and the biotechnology and manufacturing processes needed to assemble lab-grown proteins into meat “without the need for animal slaughter,” as per its S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
* The company also wrote in the filing that unlike rivals who are trying to develop “unstructured” lab-grown meat products like sausages, MeaTech aims to create “high-margin, high-value structured and cultured meat products such as steak.”

And here's a [bit of DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/greeninvestor/comments/m1yv2o/meatech_3d_ipo_will_this_3d_meat_printer_also/) from u/birdweiser2 as well:
>PROS

>First 3d meat printer (lab grown meat) listed on a major US exchange. The market likes cleantech, 3d printers, and stocks that are unique.

>The founder (Sharon Fima) worked for Nanodimension. Should be enough for Cathie Wood fanboys. It could maybe get added to ARKK - who knows - but people are gonna think it will.

>Bill Gates said rich companies shouldn't be eating meat. Gates is invested in Memphis Meats which does something really similar to what MeaTech does, but isn’t a public company. Memphis raised in 2019 which put the valuation at 2 billion, then raised again a couple months ago, but none of the articles I saw gave a valuation on that raise. Can anyone shine some light on that?

>CONS

>This company has no revenue and says it won’t for a while. So it’s basically a SPAC lol, but at a fraction of the price since they’re mostly all a billion and higher.

>There’s a lot of competitors in this space, but again this is the first to list and it’s at least 10x cheaper than the biggest competitor.

>Their meat products will be expensive when they do go on sale, but I think rich people will want them still. Kinda like how Tesla started - their cars were expensive for a long time, rich people bought them, it helped grow the company, and now they’re cheaper.


While this clearly won't see instant explosive growth like Beyond Meat did (an established brand that had been on the market for years), I entered a small position to keep an eye on this sector.

Basically I heard about the importance of the bond yield rate recently and it sounded quite important. Then I heard about the auction happening on Wednesday and that sounded like it could have consequences, good or bad. From what I understand, the auction was able to sell bonds and thus the yield rate didn’t raise much at all. Then I was like “ok cool that’s over with.” 

But today I am on my yahoo finance app and just happen to see TNX as one of the suggested/trending/whatever items. TNX is the 10 year treasury indicator (idk if it’s a stock or a index or what).

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.","['GOOGL', 'AMP', 'MSFT']"

m3qhl9,,investing,post,1615581269,"Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics to Commercialize Canada’s First Automated Heavy Duty Trucking TechnologyCanadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.""

""This project applies unique and made-in-Ontario Artificial Intelligence technology that offers increased safety and efficiency, with a reduced carbon footprint, to the goods supply chains on which we all rely,"" said Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This is the latest example of how Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network acts as a catalyst, fostering partnerships between ambitious technology start-ups and industry to develop and commercialize next generation transportation technologies that strengthen our economy and benefit society.""

""The trucks are currently transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution centre in the Greater Toronto Area and nearby rail terminals within a 12.5 mile radius, and early results are promising"" said Raghavender Sahdev, CEO of NuPort Robotics. ""The aim of the project is to develop a system that incorporates an autopilot feature for conventional trucks with a driver, leading to the most efficient way to drive and increase safety. The sensors work as a ‘safety cocoon' to cover blind spots and prevent accidents and the end result is peak fuel efficiency, meaning lower carbon emissions, and peak driving performance for an overall more optimal transportation experience.""

NuPort Robotic's approach to autonomous trucking is unique in the industry because it focuses only on solving the middle mile challenge, using a known set of predetermined trucking routes that are repetitive and high frequency as opposed to general highway driving. Ultimately, when implemented on fixed routes in the future, Canadian Tire will benefit from faster commercial deployments and improvements in supply chain sustainability.

""Canadian Tire embraces innovation and is always testing new technologies to improve our operational efficiency and safety. As proud Canadian companies, the safety of all stakeholders, including drivers, employees, customers, and public will be the top priority as we work together towards deployment of this technology,"" said Gary Fast, Vice-President of Transportation, Canadian Tire.

""Over the last three years, Canadian Tire has made a significant effort to solve complex business problems by using the Canadian start-up Artificial Intelligence ecosystem, and NuPort Robotics exemplifies what we look for in a start-up with a focus on innovation, automation and artificial intelligence,"" added Cari Covent, Vice President of Intelligent Automation, Canadian Tire.

""As NuPort Robotics continues to develop new technologies to overcome middle mile supply chain problems and advance autonomous trucking, I am extremely grateful for the support of the Ontario Government through AVIN and the Ontario Centre of Innovation. With their continued support, we are striving to position Canada as the leader in autonomous transportation,"" Sahdev said.

**What is** **Daré** **Bio?**

Daré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s health. The company’s mission is to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility.

**Why this stock hit my radar/why you should care:**

Daré just recently announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of a one-time treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The treatment, DARE-BV1, received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and, based on the topline results of the trial, Daré said it planned to file a new drug application in the first half of 2021. This has further attracted analysts and larger investors to keep their eyes on Daré in the upcoming months as it could be used massively later in 2021.

The condition affects approximately 21 million women in the United States, usually in their reproductive years, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352279). The condition, which generally doesn’t cause complications, can, however, lead to preterm birth or increase the risk of infertility due to infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes.

**Products in the Pipeline: (Information here is quoted directly from the company's website)**

***Ovaprene*** **(CURRENTLY OBSERVING DATA FROM PHASE 3)**

Ovaprene is a hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive designed to provide contraception over multiple weeks by releasing a locally acting agent which impedes sperm motility, coupled with a unique knitted polymer barrier that physically blocks sperm from entering the cervical canal. The novel combination of these complementary approaches has the potential to produce efficacy consistent with existing short-acting hormone birth control options (pills, patches, vaginal ring), without the use of hormones.

In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.

**NOTES FOR THIS ONE:**

THIS PRODUCT IS HUGE IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL. I cannot express how many women struggle due to contraceptives altering their hormones. Birth control medications ranging from pills to IUDS alter women's hormones causing a laundry list of issues such as weight gain, health complications, and mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc.). If this product is successful, it will be the FIRST in women's contraception to create a product like this that can be administered monthly for women. There is only one other product that really exists that women can use for hormone-free contraception, and that is a specific type of an IUD. HOWEVER, IUDs are EXTREMELY painful, and I am sure many women will prefer Ovaprene as it is additionally self-administered.

***SILDENAFIL CREAM*** **(CURRENTLY IN PHASE 2b CLINICAL TRIALS)**

Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is the inability to reach or maintain a sufficient physical response to sexual stimulation. An estimated 16% of women ages 21 to 60, or approximately 10 million women in the U.S., are distressed from experiencing symptoms of low or no sexual arousal and are seeking a solution to improve their condition. To put the market opportunity for an FDA-approved FSAD treatment in context, the prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction (ED) in men is estimated to be about 5% of men at age 40, increasing to about 15% at age 70.

Still, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for FSAD. Orally administered sildenafil received FDA approval in 1998 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and is marketed under the brand name Viagra®. Given the underlying pathophysiologic similarities of ED and FSAD, using sildenafil to direct blood to the genitals before sexual activity could provide a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience for women as it does in men.

Our localized, proprietary formulation of sildenafil cream, 3.6% (topical cream, sildenafil), has been designed specifically for women. The targeted application of this cream to the genital tissue is designed to increase local blood flow without the associated systemic exposure and side effects, leading to an improvement in overall sexual experience and response.

***DARE-BV1*** **(SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PHASE 3 TRIALS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS)**

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common type of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. In the U.S. alone, bacterial vaginosis is estimated to affect approximately 21 million women. While there are several orally and vaginally delivered therapeutic interventions indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, currently approved options in the U.S. have relatively insufficient clinical cure rates, require sequential daily administrations or can be otherwise inconvenient for women to use.

DARE-BV1 is a thermosetting vaginal gel formulated with clindamycin phosphate 2% designed for prolonged, localized release of the antibiotic.

**Upcoming Products:**

I'm going to be quite honest here, there are a TON of diverse products that this company is currently working on to counter sexual disorders and health complications involving sexual activity. They are additionally looking into contraceptives for Males as well. This company currently has many of these products in the pre-trials stage, but they are committed to continuing research for the benefit of people's health.

**Previous Drop in Price:**

One thing I think many people will look at and question is the 5-year chart for Daré; this stock used to trade at $33/share back in 2017. However, after the acquisition of another company known as Cerulean, Daré conducted a 10 to 1 reverse split which I think additionally scared off investors. Not to mention, COVID additionally further spiked the price down along with other stocks in 2020 as well.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

&#x200B;

1. On March 25th, Dare will announce their Q4 earnings (pre-market). Based on their positive phrase 3 clinical results, this is predicted to be a positive earnings call with further products hopefully entering phase 3 trials soon.
2. Dare is further participating in two upcoming conferences to debut their products to large investors.

&#x200B;

* Conference #1: **33rd Annual Roth Conference (March 15th)** \[This is the same conference that companies like *Assertio* will be presenting at.\]
* Conference #2: **M Vest and Maxim Group Inaugural Emerging Growth Virtual Conference (March 17 & 18)**
* Conference #3: **BIO-Europe Spring Digital (March 22 - 25)**

1. **Results for clinical trials on Ovaprene.**

&#x200B;

* \*\*Ovaprene is currently in the process to enter clinical trials which are already looking successful. The following is quoted from the DARE website: ""\*\*In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.""

Something to pull away from this is that they are spreading awareness continuously during this month about their successful trials and upcoming products. Partners and investors are their major concern at the moment, and this is a great opportunity for them to pull in potential partners/investors based on previous successes.

**My Take**

Dare is not only a short term investment for the month of March, but a long term investment under a Biden administration. Biden has stated multiple times that women's health is a priority with his focus on health care during his presidency. This backed by other democrats could be a major upside for women's health companies such as Dare. Obviously I recommend you all do your own DD, but this company has the potential to blow up over the course of 2021 with its price target being moved to the $5 - 9 range.

m3hspu,gqrh1fc,investing,comment,1615604600,"So I am a Dr

I'm terrible at analyzing stocks or individual companies.  Plenty of pharmaceutical manufacturers are big time risks, this one included.  So, while I can't comment on the company itself, I think I can talk a little about how successful a drug can be...

Ovaprene: this is basically a diaphragm.  This may be a hard sell for a few reasons...
For one, if someone is going to use a temporary implant, they want it to be out of the way, painless, and not to interfere with sex drive.  It sounds like it covers all of the above.  You listed the major competitors of this product with exception to the copper IUD.  Copper IUD's are the most effective contraceptive device on the market, AND they don't have hormones.  Like all IUD's they are initially painful when placing, but usually lasts a brief period of time.  The copper IUD can cause more painful or heavier cycles, but it rarely gets dislodged, as it is far past the cervix when placed.  The copper iud is more expensive than other IUD's, and honestly I don't know why.  So when I think of non-hormonal contraceptives that arent condoms or spermicides, I think of copper iud's.  This will likely be the biggest competitor.  IF it pans out that ovaprene passes trials, AND gets marketed correctly, AND proves to be effective, AND is more comfortable/less side-effects than copper, then I can see this product being a huge success.  But those are a lot of ifs...

And there's also nuvaring...  not sure how they are gonna sell against nuvaring.

Sildenafil cream: there are case reports here and there of women who accidentally took their husbands viagra.  short answer: its been prescribed as an off label use for hypoactive sex drive, but it is not FDA approved.  Flibanserin/Addyi was supposed to be the big one: viagra for women.  It had 2 rejections by the FDA because of serious side effects like low blood pressure worsened by alcohol and contraceptive pills.

sildenafil cream: If this works as well as it sounds - this may be the most profitable product you listed above. 


DARE BV-1: this product has too many competitors.  I am surprised they are pursuing this given how easy it is to treat BV.  We used to treat BV with a single day of antibiotics metronidazole.  And a lot of doctors still do this.  Its cheap, and effective, and yea, the side effects suck (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), but you will be hard pressed to convince docs to use a topical antibacterial for BV if it ends up being more expensive than the $5 worth of metronidazole.  ADDITIONALLY, we already have clindamycin cream out which has been used for BV.  It resulted in antibiotic resistance and increased rates of re-infection. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15507930/


I question the viability of all of these products except the topical sildenafil.  I worry that this is a pump and dump honestly...

m3cdt9,,investing,post,1615533365,"My 4 most anticipated IPO/DPO's for the rest of 2021New company listings are always exciting and I generally try to keep track of any big news surrounding unicorns. These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.


I made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I'd share the next 4 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren't too familiar with, so if you think you've got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!


Mine are as follows:


1.Applovin

1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. 


2.Vizio

2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn't have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We'll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. 


3.Nextdoor

Just going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There's not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. 

I am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. 

4.This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. 


There are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren't listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones that I'm personally bullish on and probably won't get as much attention.","['WMT', 'NDAQ', 'CRM']"

I'm passive investor with 5% of my portfolio in Emerging Markets (index). I've been thinking lately that it's not really worth it to invest in these stocks. Emerging market economies may indeed enjoy higher level of GDP growth than developed economies, but their corporate governance is substandard, corruption may be rampant, and the rule of law inconsistent. The result is that much of that growth is captured by insiders rather than by the public investors at large.

While the market is undoubtedly aware of the problems and presumably takes them into account when setting prices, I'm not confident the market can accurately price in unknown information (for example, we don't really know what goes on in China). Emerging Mkts is pehaps one of the few areas where active management makes sense. Indexing assumes the market is efficient, that assumption may not be true in some emerging markets.

I feel index investors are better off focusing exclusively on the US and other developed markets where we will get a fair shake. Large corporations like MCD and Coke already have exposure to emerging markets, and unlike locally traded shares, their financials are not suspect.",['MCD']

m339dm,gqmx055,investing,comment,1615508805,"Macro economics and politics matter more than valuations in EM, but don't write them off just due to political risk.

With valuations so high around the world, there really aren't any safe bets anymore. You are taking another type of risk by being entirely in developed market equities. 

A bet on EM is simply a bet that things will ""get better"" rather than get worse. If China can slowly grow to be 20% less crooked than they are today, then financial markets should reward them with higher multiples.

If you are okay with taking on the risk of investing in EM, here are some options besides a market index:

- DGS: One of the two EM ETFs I hold. It holds small companies only, so hopefully less political risk, and screens/weighs by dividends, because unlike financial statements you cannot easily fake a dividend. 

- AVEM: A relatively new ETF from Avantis that holds a smaller universe than VWO, with tilting towards quality/fundamentals.. without making big sector bets. Yes, fundamentals in EM can be cooked, but IMO this ETF will lean away from market bubbles that are common in that sphere. The team managing this ETF has a pretty good pedigree. 

- Actively managed funds: Vanguard has a good active fund. T Rowe does as well but I believe theirs is closed to new money. My advice is to pick a fund that checks these marks: fee under 1%, low turnover, less than 500 stocks, manager has skin in the game (you can verify via Morningstar), and I would avoid anything that leans too heavily towards growth/tech. All the above matter more than recent performance. 

For the record, I am heavily invested in EM but I also hold $1 in conflict hedge for every $5 of China exposure..so I am loaded up on LMT, NOC, LHX, and EAF. If China ever attacks Taiwan all global markets will crash anyway though, not just EM.

Edit: the reason to not hold the full index and instead hold a smaller universe...is because IMO successfully investing in EM is more about what you *don't* hold rather than what you hold. VWO is forced to hold every single Hong Kong listed stock, and I'd rather have a screen for fraud/bs/shenanigans. You can achieve that screen by using an active fund or an ETF that screens on dividends (DGS) or quality (AVEM).","['NOC', 'LMT', 'LHX']"

But choose LOVE in these tough times to you fellow redditors.Hey Reddit - can we all just step back for a second and appreciate how good things really are?  I think a lot of our reddit threads need some love and positivity, versus just memes and negative pressured news.

To that end, **I'm sending some good vibes, love, and true positivity your way on a Friday**. This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

To the entire stock market community - please know you're not alone. **Life is beautiful in so many ways, all you need to do is find the right places to look. Your loved ones, your family, and those in your circle love the positive you** \- so let's work together to foster a community beyond memes and tendies, but honest and open truth about how we're feeling.

**If anyone needs to chat - PLEASE MESSAGE ME.**  I'm here for you.  Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.",['ARKK']

Good morning Traders, Expiration day big move in store for today... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... [Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 3 19 21](https://youtu.be/YbIiDsZ7qKQ)

📷

Big move instore for today. Keys to today... first is expected move, which on the high end is 401.16 and low end is 386.96. More than not lately we have tagged one end of the expected move. Next is bonds and rates, will they back off enough to get a pop/rebound today. Bonds need to stay above 153’3, rates back off awhile not pushing sharply up thru 17.55. Third are internals: gaps or extreme opening prints will mean a pause for the moment in current downtrend but will be temporary. Forth and probably most important is understanding day structure and identifying that as early as possible. The different day structures are as follows; range day, trend day up, trend day down, and rounded reversal which I like to call trange day. Now the 3 outcomes to prepare for today are 1) we hold support at 388 area with a pause in rate and bond drama we get a pop today toward 393 area. The 393 area will hold another decision.2) we open with a gap down on both the spy and internals we try to retest yesterdays close of 391.41 and fail giving us a down trend day Hold on its going to be a long ride down.3) we consolidate between 391 and 388 areas before breaking higher or lower.

1. we hold support at 388 area with a pause in rate and bond drama we get a pop today toward 393 area. The 393 area will hold another decision. **40% probability**
2. we open with a gap down on both the spy and internals we try to retest yesterdays close of 391.41 and fail giving us a down trend day Hold on its going to be a long ride down. **50% probability**
3. we consolidate between 391 and 388 areas before breaking higher or lower. **10% probability**

Unless we get very extreme openings on internals, I will wait the first 20 to 30 min to identify day structure first before making any additional moves",['GPS']

It’s never really to late if you plan on a long term investment.

You always want to make sure that what you are putting your money towards is something that has a foreseeable future, or something that you believe has the potential to be something someday. Every coin, crypto, token, etc... has some sort of overall goal or game plan. Make sure that it is reputable. And MOST IMPORTANT....

why do bond yields matter? because the 10-year treasury is now more profitable than the S&P 500 overall dividend yield. this metric means that since april 2020 there was no alternative to investing money except in stocks or staying in cash - now there is an alternative in the fixed income market (even though these pathetically low interest rates still won't keep up with inflation). this is creating large fund changes and reallocations to begin. the most noticable effect is long term risky equities will be dumped first (why? their future earnings / profits are getting cut due to potentially higher costs of borrowing and inflation), and recovery play stocks will be held or pushed higher.",['SPGI']

I have a few questions for someone that is brand new to the stock market. I appreciate any and all of you that take time out of your busy and hopefully lucrative day to answer some of these questions.
 
First, I would just like to casually trade on my own without the help of a stock broker. Like, I want to look at a stock, click purchase, enter the amount I would like to purchase, then click submit, and now I own that amount of stock. Same with selling. I understand there may be fees involved at different levels and I am fine with that, but for the time being I don't want to have to tell a stock broker to purchase or sell for me. What is the best (and cheapest) platform for this?
 
Second, what are puts and calls? How do they differ from just buying the stock itself?
 
Next, I am sure someone has broached this subject before, but after the gamestop thing occurred why not get everybody on this sub (or others as well) together and agree to purchase another stock jointly? Like, a stock worth $50 or less per share and cause it to increase, just like with gamestop? Is it not easier and quicker to get a stock to go from say $5 to $100, than it is to get a stock to go from $100 to $150? And then just keep doing this after that new stock hits a pre-determined number. Like once it hits $100 or $150 per share, then a large portion of people get out and move on to the next stock.",

2. A call or put is an option. You buy the option to buy a stock (usually 100 shares at once) at a pre set price before the expiration date. The call or put price is based on the expiration date, underlying value, market volatility and the execution price. It's very different from a normal stock because it loses value because of time and you own the option to buy (or sell) not the company itself. Shares don't expire.
3. It's illegal... So it's a bad idea!",

I live in Western part of US, by the time i catch my first cup of coffee which is about 6:30 AM (9:30 EST), i see some stocks are already up by 30-40% and during rest of my day they are pretty flat with minimum curve. For example UPST was up by 58% already yesterday at 6:30 AM my time, by the time i caught the train it already left few stations (i still cashed in on the last 20+% by end of the day). I am curious how do i catch the start of the day, may be when its up 10%, do i need to get up early? i kept checking the stock price on [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) the price didn't change until may be its already 58% up. what gives?

what am i missing? do i need to check it on a different resource to catch the early bird? i use JP Morgan chase for trading, i am willing to switch if there is a better provider that lets me catch the early bird.

m8iq2y,grhuh6u,StockMarket,comment,1616171304,"I'm on the west coast also. Most days, I don't want to trade that early anyway, and I can get up later, see what happened, etc. Other times I set contingent market orders, so if something gaps up I can get the market rate. Usually the prices were already moving in extended-hours, so the movement isn't even at open, but before the open.

Other days I'm up and 6 making coffee so I can be ready. Especially if I think the market is generally going up, or sideways, but there was some bad news after the market closed that will cause a bit of rotation in the morning. Then I want to be up early to discount shop before it recovers.

It is often recommended for inexperienced traders not to trade in the first half hour anyway, because there is a lot of weird volatility. You only really want to be up for the open if you're specifically targeting that.👼",

m80b80,,StockMarket,post,1616100430,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021 

Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks.  Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

As of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control.

Her vision for this stock might not make sense to some people and I can understand why. They aren't making profits and if you consider their financials, their stock shouldn't even be valued at where it is now. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, came on CNBC and blatantly stated that if you are not in this company for the long run, it is not for you. I fully agree. You have to have vision when it comes to stocks like this, you have to understand it's potential. And jeez, Palantir has soo much potential for growth.

Palantir is a software company that deals with data. Data will be very important in the future; It will do so many things for companies and it's software is ahead of it's time. 17 years in the making. 17 fucking years in the making, endless amounts of funding by the government to make this technology happen. It really has no competitors that come close to what they are doing. It has happened. They are pushing their technology to the commercial market, they have already signed so many deals and made so many partnerships with BIG companies and government contracts. A lot of clients are actually INVESTING in the company. That speaks for it self. What I find interesting is that Palantir actually has no marketing team... crazy to think about, but it just reassures my conviction in this company. It is just the beginning for Palantir.

Palantir will lead many frontiers in the coming and near future, AI for one. AI is expected to reach 733.6 billion by 2027. If it leads in markets such as AI, imagine the growth Palantir will have. I believe it is going to be one of the few companies that will reach a 1 trillion valuation.

People really haven't realized what this company is doing, and once they do, liftoff ladies and gentlemen, buckle up.

Allied Energy Corporations (AGYP) is making rapid growth over the last 2 months, rising as much as 500%, which led them to make a huge move by hiring an extremely well-known member of the oil community, Curtis William Boyles. to execute their potential lead in the best way possible. It is known that when the oil prices rise, many companies will be looking to invest into expanding their oil production capacity, which will be affordable with the profit they will be making from the rise.

After AGYP rapid growth they decided to make a different kind of investment, to hire Curtis William Boyles, A man with more than 30+ years of experience that is highly respected within the oil sector as an Oil and Gas operations manager and consultant. He will be in looking after all necessary operations, drillings, and water well injection permits. Mr. Boyles will also the judge all potential acquisitions and joint-venture endeavors.

On top of that, AGYP will be rely on Mr. Boyles to manage all planning and operations of property evaluation projects to determine investment potential, development, exploratory findings, Manage infrastructure and property purchases.

On 4 march of 2021 AGYP has signed an agreement with a premier partner in the Texas oil industry to gain majority ownership of two producing oil wells in northern Texas. The company will be having 100% working interest and 80% Net Revenue interest ownership. By looking at Mr. Boyles overall reputation and expertise, it is safe to assume that these 2 wells with AGYP’s growth and huge future potential are in reliable hands.

I started investing/trading just a few months ago and the mental turmoil is a lot more that I expected, to be completely honest. Losing money in stocks you thought would take off just for them to go red and drain your account is very disheartening. I’ve seen a lot of tickets go up double digits, even triple, in percentage and have given in to FOMO more than I’d like to admit. Nothing is worse than seeing massive gains turn into massive loss. I’ve thought about giving up so many times. I’ll say it right now, I’ve been super disappointed in myself even if I’ve only lost a net few hundred dollars. In a crazy market like this, how are new investors supposed to keep up in this environment? 

This seems like a rant and doesn’t really fit here in an informative way, but it’s easy to dismiss the emotional and mental strength you need to participate in the market. To fellow new investors: you guys aren’t the only ones losing and you are not alone. Take a step back and analyze what you’re doing wrong and learn from your mistakes. Revaluate if you can handle the market and be real with yourself. Personally, I’m taking a break to get away from all of this. It has been eating me up everyday looking at my account and trying to catch tickers that aren’t going to absolutely wreck my account. For one, I need to work on patience and not expect instant gains/free money. If anyone can relate to my experiences, I hope this helps you out in any way and give you motivation to not give up.

If you're truly long on the company and believe it will continue to grow, innovate, and pivot with changing times, just buy and hold shares. On bad days, avg down your cost per share, or just hold if you can't afford to buy more. Just be patient & if you're nervous about a position don't take a loss, wait for your position to be neutral or positive then sell.

If not, here’s the written DD version:

USEI is a CBD, Green Energy and Cryptocurrency stock. I’m really excited and bullish on this stock since it has multiple things going for it. #1 they have assets worth way more than the stock price is trading at currently, #2 they are about to go pink current which is a huge catalyst, they’ve already filed their financials, now they just need to file the attorney letter, and #3 there are some possible catalysts coming which would be the revealing of 2 companies that they own.


https://usenergyinitiatives.com/

As we can see on their website, they’re focused on MJ, green energy and currencies as it goes forth in the coming years. 

Now, their new plan is what I’m really excited for and I’m sure this will really be the gamechanger for this company. They pivoted from being a primarily MJ focused business, but now they’re looking to focus on Green Energy and Crypto mining. 

Now, the last sentence is what’s really important here. They’re talking about how they have a significant amount of assets in certain currencies that they’ll use to grow their company in the future. 

I’ll talk about those assets in a second, but first, I did want to talk about their industries section, so the first one is Green Energy which they say they’ll be using wind and solar energy to help power their crypto currency operation. This basically means they’re able to provide electricity to their crypto miners for a very low cost, which is honestly pretty unique, having low margins when mining crypto is super important. One NASDAQ stock I’m invested in is CLSK, and they have micro grids that allow them to mine bitcoins at a 90% margin which is insanely high. I don’t know what margins USEI has for their mining operation, but I do like the fact that they’re using these resources to get their costs lower.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/05/1644764/0/en/USEI-Takes-Ownership-of-5-1-M-Sumcoin.html

So like I mentioned earlier, they said they have a significant amount of assets in certain currencies that they’ll use to grow their company in the future. So we see here they announced their ownership of 52.7k Sumcoins in exchange for 3.6million USEI shares. The value of SUMCOIN that they had acquired at the time was worth $5.1 million.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/USEI/profile


Right now, SUMCOIN is trading at $810, let’s use $800 for our calculations, but their SUMCOIN is now worth about 42 million dollars, when the market cap of the company itself is only 26 million dollars. So this stock is super cheap right now, in my opinion.

https://sec.report/otc/financial-report/274349

Now, I know you guys are probably wondering if they still have those coins. There’s another company out there named Coin Citadel, ticker symbol CCTL that’s been leading on its investors whether they still hold Bitcoin from several years ago, but this company on the other hand has their financials updated. This is their balance sheet for the calendar year of 2020, and we can see they have their SUMCOINs as an asset with a value of 5.1 million dollars. Now, that 5.1 million dollars figure is a bit confusing, if we scroll down in the balance sheet, we see that in 2016 they made the transaction to acquire those currencies and were valued at about 5 cents per share and at the time of writing the document they are trading over $400 per coin. NOtE: the overall value of this currency is continually noted at this $5 million evaluation value and will continually be priced at this value until it is sold.

Now, it’s confusing since they said it was worth 5 million dollars when the coin was trading at 5 cents per coin, but in the PR earlier, they said they acquired 52.7k, so I’m just going to assume the value 52.7k is correct.

So on their twitter, they’ve been talking about how they just filed the first of 5 OTC Market Reports and are in the process to getting back to pink current.

https://sec.report/Ticker/USEI

Now on the SEC filings, we can see that they have 3 quarterly reports and 1 annual report for 2020, meaning all their financials are up to date, and I believe we only need to wait for their attorney letter with respect to current information, which could come any day and is a huge catalyst, so I think that you guys should hop on this stock ASAP, but this is not financial advice.

https://twitter.com/USEnergyInit

Now if we go  on their twitter, there’s 2 interviews with the CEO, feel free to listen to them for yourself, there’s alot of insight that he gives, but I’ll try to give you guys some of the highlights of them. So in the Feb 21 interview, the CEO confirmed they have a significant holding of crypto still which is SUMCOIN, there’s a high possibility of a share buyback, there were some issues that USEI had over the past few years that have all been resolved, and there’s potentially another company that could be working with USEI. He also said that he’s really confident that USEI will do really well this year and there’s nothing stopping them, they said that they do not need any more financing. 

In the February 14 interview, he again confirmed they have their SUMCOINS, and the CEO talked about how they’ll be planning to coordinate with multiple companies and they actually own 2 companies in the crypto space, and possibly a 3rd one soon.

So as a recap of everything, CEO is super confident in the company, the company just changed their plans and is focusing on the Green Energy and Crypto mining industry recently, they have 52.7k SUMCOINS which is worth about $42 million, and they’re getting pink current very very soon. In my opinion, these are all very bullish signs and I personally will be buying this stock, but do your own research, anyways that’s going to be it for today’s DD if you guys liked it and want to hear more research on OTC stocks, feel free to subscribe to my youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHXRDSK_npOQYM0bjcLFhOQ , I’ll catch you guys in the next one, peace out.","['NDAQ', 'TWTR']"

m89rr5,,StockMarket,post,1616130192,"The 10 year and its effect on the marketIn light of recent events, can someone please clarify how the 10 year effects the markets? I seem to be a little confused.

From my understanding, the 10 year is the prime benchmark that measures investor sentiment across financial markets. If bond prices are down yields go up, that signals that investors feel they can make a higher return elsewhere ( i.e. confidence in the markets) if bond prices are higher and yields are trending downwards it would suggest the opposite. 

My question is this: why did a hike in the 10 year yield spook the market into a sell off today? Rising yield rates indicate that investor confidence in the market is high, right? So wouldn’t we only need to be concerned with lower yield rates? (i.e. low confidence in the market; investors feel that their money is better off in bonds rather than the stock market)",

m84dyk,,StockMarket,post,1616111970,"Interesting Ford Motors US$2B Convertible Note 

Ford Motors stock is getting beaten up this week. The stock closed last Friday (3/12/21) at US$13.36. The stock closed today at about US$12.49. I think that slide will end tomorrow (3/19/21). Ford Motors has 4B, more or less, common shares outstanding, partly owned (52% +/-) by about 1,300 institutional investors. Early this week Ford Motors announced a Private Placement Debt Convertible zero coupon Note offering for US$2B. The offering was priced about Wednesday and offered to its qualified institutional investors. The terms of the offering was for every US$1,000 Note, there would be zero interest paid, and it would be a five year convertible Note, all due March 15, 2016. The conversion rate is set at 57.1886 shares per US$1,000 principal amount of the Note, implying a conversion price of about US$17.49 per share. The Company expects to receive the funds from the offering tomorrow. The funds are being partly used to further develop the Company's future technology with regard to electric vehicles. Ford Motor Company is reinventing itself from a old-line automobile manufacturing company to a automotive electric technology company and self-driving transportation company. As the Company transforms itself, the stock will be re-priced.

So the stock has been beaten up. Is this convertible note a good deal for the Company, or not? Looking at it from the Company's point-of-view, as the CFO, another way to look at it is that the Company sold a Five-year Leap Option for $1,000 premium to the Buyer to purchase 57.1886 shares at $17.49 per share to be exercised before March 15, 2026, with the ""string"" that the Company would pay the US$1,000 back, without any interest, if the Note holder does not exercise the conversion privilege. If any dividend is declared to the common stock, these convertible Notes are not included in the dividend. So, the Company has the US$1,000 to work with now, and for the next five years, and maybe pay the principal back, without interest, or issue 57.1886 shares.

On the other side, the institutional investor has to make a few decisions: what is the expected rate of return on invested capital? At what price does the institution expect Ford common stock to be selling in five years. If the institution expects a seven percent return on this type of investment it would have to earn US$70.00 per year. Then, the stock would have to sell for more than US$17.49 plus $6.12 = US$23.61. ($70.00 X 5 years = $350 divided by 57.1886 = US$6.12 ). (These are, of course, back-of-the-envelope numbers, and there are other considerations, in addition to not receiving any recurring interest or return on investment, effects of inflation, and the institution turns the US$1,000 from a liquid asset to a non-liquid asset and the opportunity costs to invest the same money somewhere else at a higher return).

Looking at it from the point-of-view of a shareholder, the above rough number of US$23.61 is about twice what the stock is selling for today. If the stock doubled in value in five years, that would be a 14.4% per cent return per year. I personally think Ford will do much better than that over the next five years. I personally think Ford will double in 18-24 months. Lots going on with Ford, and a lot of new models, including the electric Ford-150, Bronco and Mustang.

This is how I see it with the information I have, what do you think? . . . I could be wrong . . . .",

# Summary

* With increasing demand for Lithium I wanted to find a Lithium producer that has strong reserves and upside in the medium to long term
* LAC has the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America and the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* These two assets are under development but are nearing completion. Price dipped recently but based on their existing assets and recent analyst price targets LAC seems like a decent investment

# Lithium Background

I wanted to understand how Lithium is extracted to make sure I could gauge the viability of the lithium mining companies I was looking at. I summarized my findings below if you are curious. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022. [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/lithium-production-2340123#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20extract%20lithium,increasingly%20high%20concentrations%20of%20lithium.)

Tpa = Tonnes Per Annum – essentially how much Lithium they can extract on a yearly basis

# Market Overview

To summarize – Lithium demand is expected to grow exponentially. 2 main factors:

1. Falling Lithium prices over the last 3 years reduce investment in Lithium production globally

2. Surging demand for EVs and shift to green energy

**Lithium prices continue to soar – up 88% in 2021** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/lithium-prices-continue-to-soar-up-88-in-2021/)

**Schlumberger unit to launch Nevada lithium plant as EV demand rises** [**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-schlumberger-energy-plans-lithium-134649877.html)

If you haven’t heard of Schlumberger check them out, they are the world’s largest oilfield service company. If they are shifting into the lithium production space then the leadership team sees value and growth here. Also from the article “Demand for battery-grade lithium is projected to grow exponentially, driven by growth in the electric vehicle market, and efficient production of the metal has become an important topic for regions, industries, and technology companies.”

**Battery grade lithium prices in China surge 68%** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/battery-grade-lithium-prices-in-china-surge-68/)

While lithium’s majors are beginning to reengage in expansion plans, three years of falling lithium prices have failed to incentivize sufficient investment into the supply chain, leading to greater risks of price volatility as battery demand ramps up.

The prices here are in yuan/tonne so if we use a conversion rate of 1 yuan = $0.15 USD. Assume price is around 80,000 yuan/tonne then it is about $12,000 USD/tonne

# Lithium Americas

Leadership is one of the key aspects I look at when considering an investment. Most of their leadership team has 20+ years in lithium or resource production. They have a CTO who has 1-\_ year of lithium processing experience and used to work for Tesla. Check out their investor [presentation](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf) for a bit of background, but essentially from what I’ve seen they have a strong management team.

2 Main sites under development for Lithium

**Caucharí-Olaroz, Argentina (Brine Extraction)**

* Caucharí-Olaroz is the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America
* Partnered with Ganfeng Lithium on the jointly owned operation in Jujuy, Argentina
* Average production 40,000 tpa battery-grade Li2CO3
* After-Tax NPV10% is  $1.5 billion
* Quick math: 40,000 tpa x $12,000 USD/tonne = $480M USD annually
* Note: Production doesn’t start until 2022
* Capital expenditures for the Project remain on budget with $477 million (84%) of the $565 million committed, including $388 million (69%) spent, as of December 31, 2020.

**THACKER PASS LITHIUM PROJECT (Clay Extraction)**

* Developing the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* 100% owned by Lithium Americas with offtake rights uncommitted
* On January 15, 2021, the US Bureau of Land Management issued the Record of Decision following completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process.
* All remaining state permits and water right transfers required to commence construction **are expected later this year.**
* Top ten biggest lithium mines in the world [here](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) **Thacker Pass Lithium Project is #2**

# Summary of March 2, 2021 Full Year and Q4 Report 

I highlighted some key points and provided commentary to their recent Annual report

* · As at December 31, 2020, the Company had $148 million in cash and cash equivalents ($518 million as at February 28, 2021).  **great position to be in, especially with heavy CAPEX projects, especially with amount that has been spend in Argentina**
* · On January 22, 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock and issued 18,181,818 common shares at a price of $22.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $400 million (approximately $377 million net proceeds). **This is big especially if you look at the current price**
* On November 30, 2020, Lithium Americas completed an at-the-market equity program (“ATM Program”) and issued a total of 9,266,587 common shares from treasury for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million ($97 million net proceeds). **Price was \~$10 a share at this point in time**

Link [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-reports-2020-full-122600429.html)

**Analyst Price Target (link** [**here**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lac/forecast)**)**

* High: $30.50
* Average: $21.42
* Low: $16.00

# Risks

* **Nevada Permits** – This is always an unknow, they expect to receive permits by mid to late 2021. The Biden administration has made it clear they want to secure supply of precious resources but this permitting is at the State Level so if there is an issue this could delay the project. 
* **Argentina and China Partnership**: Their Argentinian assets is a joint venture with a Chines Lithium producer. So far it seems like development of the site has gone smoothly but geopolitical issues could prove to be a risk

# TLDR

* Price of lithium is increasing due to increased demand and ramp down of production over last 3 years
* Current US administration is looking to support and secure supply chain of critical materials and production – LAC owns 100% of the largest known lithium resource in America
* Opportunity to buy the dip and hold medium to long term

Because this world is in a growing need of energy and personally i am convinced that in the near future our renewable/green energy sourches just will not cut our demand of power. The more technology keeps growing and evolving the more power we need and nuclear power is in my eyes the cleanest and best way to get that energy compared to other current available methods. In April 2007 the stock was worth over $200 and it curently sits at ~$6,50. 

$GME Gamestop, 
After GME went BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR and is available for anywhere under 800 I think it would still be a very valuable call, I believe in GME and will never stop believing in GME and r/GME. While I'm at it a special thanks to all the mods, u/Rensole and u/Heyitspixel !!!

$LTBR Lightbride
Because they suply very efficient uranium fuel and are trying to make Thorium a way a fueling Uranium reactors! Thorium being way way way better for the enviourment, I'm pretty sure that in the upcoming years Thorium reactors will be booming! 

Not any specific but WATER stock. 
I am fully with Michael Burry on this one, drinking water is scarce and with a growing world population the ask for clean drinking water will only keep increasing. 

$LMT Lockheed Martin 
Lockheed is working on fkcing fusion energy, they claim they will have a working, functional and operating fusion reactor in 5 years. ofc its pure speculation but if that is true they will be the first company to succesfully have created a fusion reactor. 

$IBM IBM, 
IBM has been on the decline for a while but they are working very hard on quantum computers and they have already released the IBM one a while ago, a quantum computer available for purchase. Personally I am very bullish on quantum computers because as we apes are not good at counting our need for computing power keep increasing. 

$CRSR Corsair Memory, 
A lot of people have very good DD's on Corsair and since I'm in a rush I will not further evaluate on this.

$AMD AMD 
Same goes for AMD as for Corsair. 

$GOOGL Google, 
Because Google, because AI, Quantum Computers and Cloud services.

Will make edits ""soon"" to further elaborate on things, if you have good suggestions please comment.

When a company’s stock goes down, it’s because a majority of people are selling it. So if someone like Elon Musk, or Warren Buffett, or some other über rich person, just decides to buy 10 billion dollars worth of shares, what would that do to the company’s stock? Would it just skyrocket similar to a short squeeze, then just stay? I know it would obviously do something, plus if something like Elon Musk announces he’s buying 10 billion dollars of GameStop stock, then tens or hundreds of million other people would also buy that stock. What would something like that do to a stock?",

They would have to acquire shares at the selling price from other holders. As more shares are purchased, the cost per share will increase since the other sellers see an opportunity. In the end, they would own shares with an average cost basis between the cheapest shares and most expensive.

This would drive the price up but for that stock to become more valuable someone would have to buy those shares back.

There are other factors at play but this would be the general gist. Depending on how many shares are available to purchase the situation would play out similar to a squeeze.

Edit: I forgot to add that if others did the same thing then they would be competing for shares at an increasing price.",

It would send it upwards. 

If someone bought $10B worth of company stock that was not already affiliated with the company, they'd have to file something with the Securities and Exchange Commission because they might be acquiring more than a 10% stake in the company.

Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advice. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis.

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures hit by another jump in Treasury yields

> * Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures fell Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 14-month high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

> * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

*****

> # 2. Bond traders continue to battle the Fed on rates

> * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

*****

> # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

> * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

> * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

*****

> # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

> * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

*****

> # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

> * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

m7q3sl,grcqhn8,StockMarket,comment,1616073333,"I an forever bullish on MRVI. One of the most interesting genomics stocks out there. Growth is obviously helped by the fact that they are a supplier for Pfizer-Biontech mRNA covid vaccine. They have good margins and they expect to have EPS around 0.8-0.9 for 2021, so that's a P/E of 40-45 with phenomenal growth. It seems at minimum they should hit these values for 2021 and they should have plenty of room to grow in the future. 

Also recent news that one of their sectors (Trilink) is exponentially increasing mRNA availability",['PFE']

If I join Latch with $100k RSU, how likely will its per-share price 10x during IPO, like some hot unicorns did, such as Roblox/ Coupang? How is the game rule different for SPACs?

If it’ll likely appreciate dramatically (e.g. 10x) in a few months, due to wall street arrangements, then I’ll likely apply; otherwise, if it’ll behave just like an existing public stock that fluctuates normally, then I’ll likely not apply.

Ps FWIW, Latch typically grants RSUs, vest in 4 years with 1 year cliff

m7xrn4,grefwh8,StockMarket,comment,1616097199,Extremely unlikely. It’s way more likely that the price will drop to the 10.50 range. I think the SPAC bubble burst about two weeks ago.,
m7xrn4,grearny,StockMarket,comment,1616094737,"0.000001%

With an IPO or DPO, you don't really know what the market price is going to be.

With a SPAC, you already know it is priced at $10, and they do a back-room deal to effect the merger with a small premium, usually it ends up being $11-12. If it shoots up, it is generally on news, and moves before the news is public. And comes back down. There is also usually a private placement at around $12-14, so it is very unlikely to settle higher than that unless good news comes out right after the merger. And the company doesn't really want that; the good news happening before the merger helps their insiders a lot more, because they get a better value for the private placement.

SPACs are not get-rich-quick vehicles, they're backroom fake-IPOs. The only way it helps the retail trader is that we can speculate at $10-11, sell on the peak after the merger is announced, and be gone before it settles back down to $14. With an IPO, it starts high, and then settles downwards, so they usually suck for swing traders. Coupang is the ""Korean Amazon"" though, it is a special case with serious investment potential regardless where it settles in the short term. Roblox is more like a typical IPO/DPO; it was worth the $45 reference price, and there is no reason for it to sustain higher valuations without some sort of major news.👼",['AMZN']

They did add 6 billion shares during this period which created a share dilution and the company did lose about $4.5 billion dollars in the last year due to COVID, but I am confident that it will rebound, here’s why. The company has been producing turbine engines and propulsion systems for military aircraft, civil aircraft (including engines for Boeing and several other aircraft companies) and for various other applications. Being that they are the largest manufacture of engines for the RAF (British Air Force), they are government backed so they are most likely here to stay. On top of that, Rolls-Royce is getting into electric planes and they are on track to create the fastest electric plane ever made. Not only that, but they are getting involved in the energy sector. They are looking to create solutions in energy consumption and efficiency. Analysts are estimating that within the next year, the price target is at the lowest estimate $2.18, Median is $4.38 and high is $6.25. To be honest, I’m fairly new to investing but I think that this is an opportunity. I am open to other ideas and a discussion, but I wanted to ask for your input! I have 3,000 shares and am already up 21% since I first purchased at $1.55 late February. I’m thinking of holding long term, but again, I want to know what you guys think!","['BA', 'TGT']"

m7pi43,,StockMarket,post,1616069724,"Why we are down in the futures today - Why the news from the FOMC meeting was actually bad for the marketsThe FOMC meeting was met with extreme optimism. At 2 pm est on wednesday the 17th we had a huge rally in all the indecies even putting SPX close to 4000 and QQQ above the daily 20SMA and 50SMA in one swoop. 

This was not the reaction that the news from the FOMC meeting deserved. It seems like the markets expected much worse news like the FED tampering asset purchases which was'nt realistic. In a post i made yesterday I had my realistic worst case scenario which was about what happened yesterday.   


1. **Real GDP projections skyrocketed from 4.2 to 6.5 for 2021**  
GDP can increase because of 2 things; economic growth & inflation. Even though USA has printed trillions of dollars they have not seen almost any growth. Instead money is flowing out of the country shown in the trade deficits. The main reason for the GDP projections are therefore not because of expectations of economic growth as some news media try to portray it as.   

2. **PCE inflation projections for 2021 rose from 1.8 to 2.4**   
This projection i did expect to rise but this is a really bad projection and it tells me that the FED either have no idea what is going on or the FED has become too politically motivated and is straight up lying to calm the bond- & stock markets. We should expect PCE inflation to increase alot more than 2.4% for 2021 because of all of this liquidity in the markets and the opening up of the economy, the PCE inflation will be much higher (Or already is much higher) around 5%.   

3. **The dot chart showed more economists at the FED projecting the federal funds rate to increase eariler than last projections.**   
This goes hand in hand with the PCE inflation projections. Because PCE inflation projections ticked up higher the projections for when the federal funds rate will increase should also be earlier.   

4. **The FED wont initiate yield curve control**  
The FED have no interest to initiate yield curve control which is understandable considering their amazing projections for the future. Jerome Powell did though wink to the bond holders that if yields rise too much they will step in.   
This is in my opinion the worst news coming out of this event. In a short period of time we have seen the 10 year treasury yield rally 240%, panic selling on the bond market like this has never been remotely close to happening since the 1970's and even then it's did'nt sell at the velocity of which it sells now. Even though we see bonds sell at this rate and record high trade deficits without notable economic growth the FED let it be. This tells me the FED either have a strategy they are not expressing or they have lost control of the bond market, meaning; the economy.   


After the event we saw a huge rally in everything. I attribute this to the great projections the FED made for the coming years. Sadly, reality hit and we see the futures market push the lows of yesterday, we see bond yields go up even faster than before now standing strong at 1.731%, the FED is about to lose this chicken race with the invisible hand. 

What I am going to do: I've had the bulk of my investments in the European markets. This is something that has been talked about by CNBC and so on since mid 2020. I will still keep a trading account to make risky trades on the US markets and for the coming 3 months i will trade it as a bear. (This is not financial advise, you make your own decisions)   


**TL;DR**   
Even though we saw a rally after the FOMC meeting it was actually a fakeout. The news from the FOMC meeting was bad and after the market has reflected on it, the selling begins.",['PM']

m7abva,,StockMarket,post,1616014270,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 17, 2021Stocks edged higher, rallying sharply in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) key monetary policy meeting and an upgraded economic outlook by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields rose again, with the 10-year benchmark at 1.646% at the time of writing.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak tomorrow.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Concerns continue to flare regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Germany, France, Italy, and Spain becoming the latest countries to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination efforts, which were already behind schedule. Studies are currently being conducted in the UK and other places. More information is needed.

As u kno options are not priced to move like a stock does. The person selling you the option around this time might charge you a higher premium to buy your calls. Where that comes from is something called implied volatility (IV). IV is probably higher around IPOs, if it has a ridiculously high IV like over 100% then maybe hold off and wait for that to go down. 

People can argue what they would consider high IV relative to a stocks potential to make big moves. There is no historical volatility to compare it to cus it's an IPO, but would you mind letting us know what the ticker is lol",

[Image is copied from one of u\/chayse1984's posts](https://preview.redd.it/j1sd6jde3yn61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d1d406b6d0ccc0b7b53c4f94f0cad9ee6d336a)

Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason, and it's not all *Brownian Motion* you stochastic cucks.

So we got two big fucking triangles up here, but do you even know *why*? Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday, dipshits? Okay... let me tell you a story.

It's 2002. Young high-flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck-you money wasn't enough for him. So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a **Market Maker**. This was the start of **Shitadel Securities**, the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet.

Almost immediately following its conception, Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket. Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time. And boy does Shitadel, **an options MM nonetheless,** have an appetite for risk. Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.

Devastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF. It's with a heavy heart that I tell you, **even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF**.

This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest **internalizer** in finance. ""Oh for fucks sakes, what the hell is an *internalizer* now?""

[At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zi54ada2jyn61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d47e4619234795a25b30a30a9c9a5af96167c)

In PFOF, your order is sent from whatever **discount brokerage** you're using to Shitadel Securities, who decides to either: A) pass your order onto the open market, where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B) to take the other side of your order (short whatever you long, or long whatever you short) **at which point the life of your order ends, never making it to the open market**.

You heard me right. **When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood, your order may never land on the open market.** But this is fine right?... Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.

*Okay, but in order for Shitadel to do this, they would need to be a monopoly, right?*

[From https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/](https://preview.redd.it/e9dxgz1npyn61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=27801bbcd469eda01dc0e172a6bccb9de6c2e96b)

*Okay, but if Shitadel were to do this, their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment, even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange, and drive the price up before Shitadel, right?*

[An obvious short attack. https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/gamestop-stock-price-trading-halts-volatility-spike-176-trading-range-2021-3-1030170445 ](https://preview.redd.it/ftjhzgexoyn61.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=1883bbf2e32492ca9614c4ec57b3a19fe1ad705b)

*Okay, okay. But why would Shitadel do this? Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of* ***Impact Cost?***

Remember how Shitadel Securities is an **options** MM? Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags? Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays? It's my opinion that **Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.** A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this. If the price jumps out of their control, not only do they lose money on all their shorts, they also lose money on all their options. If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS.

# Boom.

&#x200B;

\----- P.S. -----

Want to know what the stochastic cucks call this? **Max Pain Theory.**

Want to know my opinion on how to trades options on this? Buy leaps on Fridays like these, and ~~sell~~ not buy weeklies during bull flags like this.

&#x200B;

Tldr; Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.  If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS. 🚀🚀🚀s on  🚀🚀🚀s on  🚀🚀🚀s.

(Honestly, I was expecting the stimulus to put us back up on track, but oh well).

This is what I'm expecting to happen:

https://preview.redd.it/h3p9hjmg8zn61.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=70353b37e6121b5e1228446eaf8c7184fcb1126f

Notice we've been in that bearish funnel for a while now, and will probably test $150 before too long. After that's completed, I'm expecting to see a lot of support down there, but also intense volatility.

Now, if that holds, we're gonna try to swing up out of the channel; if it breaks, we're going down to test $115 as well.

Reason why I'm expecting us to be down is due options behavior around the next expiration dates:

https://preview.redd.it/z6kxv5zghzn61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4a36aeeedd475a77aa0989e6e767b8a592be55

&#x200B;

That's a huge short position expiring on April 1st. Also, notice how the calls/puts ratio drops from one expiration to another. To me this says people are waiting for the price to drop to get in cheaper.

But that's my take on it, what do you guys think?

m8ei9r,,wallstreetbets,post,1616150612,"Why AMC is a BUY - An Employee Perspective\*This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor\*

So to start this off, I used to be a manager for one of AMC's largest competitors, Cinemark (CNK). When covid happened, my stock portfolio took a major hit along with the market, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been. I started to look for the companies that got hit hard by the pandemic, but would bounce back stronger once the country opened back up. I immediately had movie theaters in mind for some sweet investment potential.

In the past year, CNK hit a low of $5.71 and AMC went down to $1.91 and I had to pick which horse to bet on. I opted to go all in on CNK because they were in a better financial situation, and maybe I was biased from having worked there, but it made the most sense to me until all of this came about.

As AMC climbed up to around $20 during that initial wave, my CNK went up by association, I sold, and then I turned my attention towards GME midway through the first climb and made a quick profit. Afterwards, I returned to my original movie theater plan, only this time, I was all in on AMC.

In my opinion, AMC now has the highest return potential out of all the movie theater chains, even without the short squeeze.

In early 2015 and late 2016/early 2017, both Cinemark and AMC had record breaking years. CNK stock was 1.9x higher at around $45 and AMC was 2.5x higher at around $35. Business was booming, but it wasn't really because the theaters were doing anything different, it was because the studios released A TON of record breaking movies during that time, which brought in massive revenue for theaters.

39 of the Top 50 highest grossing films were released in the last decade and 38 of those grossed over $1 billion in international box office revenue. With all the huge upcoming films, and the ones that got postponed from covid, and all the pent up demand to go to the movies, I am very confident that this trend will continue and that we'll see new record breaking films over the next few years and even the next decade.

Another concern that people were bringing up is that streaming services and VOD studio releases are going to kill movie theaters in the long run, and I think that this is completely wrong. As I just mentioned, 78% of the highest grossing films of all time came out in the last decade. While streaming services may have replaced brick and mortar video rental stores, they couldn't replace the experience of going to the movies and catching the latest film on the big screen and the increase in theater attendance over the last decade proves it.

During AMC's Q4 conference call, the CEO mentioned that over half of their customers were return customers and that they were able to track this through their AMC Stubs memberships and from my time working for their competition, I can confirm that this was the same case over at Cinemark. We had dedicated return customers that would see a movie \*at least\* once a week, seniors especially. Those seniors fucking loved a discount day and they also just liked to get out of the house.

With the country opening back up, restrictions lifted, vaccines expected to be available for all adults by May, and 98% of AMC theaters to be open by tomorrow, that brings back the regulars which made up over half their business and everything is looking green in the months to come.

I am 100% ALL IN on AMC and I have full confidence in the stock, but let's play devil's advocate:

Worst case scenario, the big squeeze doesn't happen (it will), the company struggles to pay off it's debt while accruing more debt and then they start to go under, in which case, they will more than likely get acquisitioned by another company. Amazon, Netflix, or maybe one of their competitors, and then the shareholders see a nice payday. This scenario would take the longest to play out, which is the only major downside.

Realistic Scenario, the big squeeze happens, \*possibly\* even breaking the quadruple digits, apes get tendies, the stock normalizes, and we have a party in the ruins of the hedgefunds that dared to bet against us.

Best cast scenario, the big squeeze is fucking ridiculous, we all get super rich and buy condos on the moon.

In any case, the only way to make money on AMC is to buy and hold.

Theatrical releases used to have long windows (periods of time) between theatrical release and any other release (digital, sell through, TV). In the 70s it would take years for a film like Star Wars to end up on CBS (there were only 4 channels at the time).

Since the mid 90s, these windows have been getting crushed and the future says Theatrical turnaround will be 3 weeks... 21 days.  Meaning, after 21 days in the theaters it will be available via Premium VOD, then Sell Through (not all, anymore), then, HBO, then streaming SVOD.

The reason I bring this up is because the theatrical $ take will likely no longer be what it use to, albeit strong.

I'm looking forward too seeing how else AMC adjusts (aside from taking more % of all 3 weekends).

This is in direct reference to the DD that gained some traction here earlier today. The volume for GME is low, but this does not show in any way that supply is low. In fact, there's no possible way to deduce that from graphs like these. You could draw the conclusion that the high price is leading to low volume, but not much more than that. It's fine to be optimistic, and I understand confirmation bias is nice, you always want to have accurate information on your investments.",['PSA']

m8n16n,,wallstreetbets,post,1616176712,"GME Elliott Wave Count - 3/19 Midday; Bulls Take Over, Wave iii underway**TL;DR** \- Bullish count (Primary) currently in control, with impulsive upside action; 5 waves complete at 227.00. Minor pullbacks expected as wave (1) of (iii) completes between $286 and $322. Breaking resistance at 231.02 confirms upside. Holding above support keeps further downside as alternate count.

Resistance (wave i): 231.02

Major Support (wave 4): 172.50 

Minor Support (wave ii): 183.58

**Discussion**

After watching GME pullback in corrective fashion in overlapping waves finally completing at 183.58 today, wave 1 of iii took off, and completed five waves quickly (which we would expect in a 3rd wave such as iii), extending beyond the standard .618 extension of i from ii, nearly hitting the .764 extension before turning down at 227. This completes 1 of iii of (1) of (iii). We now wait to see how far 2 retraces 1, and from 2 we can more accurately calculate these minute subwaves. However, with 1 extending beyond a standard fib target, each subsequent wave should also be lifted by the same number of fibs surpassed. In lifting these targets, we have the following regions: 3 \~ 264; iii \~286; (i) between 286 and 382.

**Conclusion:** As long as the minor support holds, we have room to run. Only a break of 183.58 forces us to consider today's upside as a new b wave of an incomplete ii. A break of 172.5 forces us to consider that the large green 4 has not yet completed. Alt yellow count remains, but as long as new supports are developed and held, we shouldn't worry about that for now. ENJOY the UPSIDE!

People are asking what I mean when I say RAMBO. spotrambo.com has a good explainer and I’ll be putting some more up over the weekend and a big batch Sunday. 

**Update 3/19 mid day:**

Forgot I keep seeing crazy OTM calls for PENN. [This one just came through today in fact](https://i.imgur.com/tTtzJNh.jpg) 

****

I realized the entire problem with last week's edition was that I forgt the fucking rocket emojis.  Never again. 🚀 🚀 🚀 

Doing this one early because your boy is heated.  To be fair, I **was pretty explicit about having low confidence in plays this week due to FOMC flukiness**--and that this was probably the closest I come to sitting shit out without sitting shit out--but still disappointed.  I don't like to let the people down!

**Word of caution**🐻 : Next week is **post-quad witching**, a historically volatile week for stocks.  For that reason I am still bagholding some VXX, choosing entries with caution, and keeping plenty of dry powder.  I don't care what Jerome says about inflation, this is not face-first YOLO time.

****

**Last week’s baggers:** Although the Tier 1 beating got most of the attention, **GPRO CS DB AAPL** all printed.  **VXX** on a ventilator but still (barely) in the game as of this writing.

**Last week’s lessons:** VIX is too unpredictable--SPY puts are the way if you have a bearish sentiment.  Also, **if you have as little confidence as I said I had last week, just sit it out**--there's no shame in kicking back. 

****

**Plays with RAMBO**

[GM](https://i.imgur.com/pLLrckZ.jpg) & 3/22 [Conference Event](https://i.imgur.com/Y8i7aE7.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

SUPER consistent OTM call buying over the past two weeks.  Unsure if this RAMBO on Monday is necessarily THE catalystbut it's worth finding out.  Either way, you're rolling with a ticker that has seen some of the most frenzied UOA for a boomer stock this quarter.  It couldn't hold above 60 after the first run, so anything lower than that may be worth getting in to see if it crosses and if 60 becomes support after the event Monday.

BUT WAIT! [There’s more....](https://i.imgur.com/zTXu6MU.jpg)

[DOCU](https://i.imgur.com/SWtoqGP.jpg)

DOCU has an investor day coming up with that peculiar post-ER timing that screams ""pump"".  They've really slid since ER, and are floating around that nice, easy benchmark 200 number.  Look to grab if it touches or dips below, and hold through the RAMBO.  This got me on board:

>Consider this: 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies and seven of the top 10 global tech companies all utilize DocuSign’s technology. In addition, 800 federal, state and local government agencies utilize the company’s platform.

Imagine them talking about that kinda shit for hours on end during an INVESTOR DAY.  Yum.

🐻: there is put buying around DOCU right now, could be hedging, could likely be during this week’s sell offs people dropped, but it’s there and subject to interpretation 

****

**Play, non-RAMBO**

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/Yn7IHJh.jpg) 🚀 🚀 
These two intriguing FB bets stood out to me as more than coincidental or tech flow.  Short dated, significantly outside the money, and one of them on the ask-side (a bullish sign).  I'm going to keep an eye on tech flow to ensure I like it, then probably test out a 4/9 290.  [Also, Zuckerberg is talking shit now like iOS priacy updates won't be the death of him.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/18/zuckerberg-facebook-may-be-in-stronger-position-after-apple-ios-14.html)

**Repeated call buying on both Unusual Whales and Unusual Options Activity that mean something to me but aren’t quite Tier 1:**

[VIAC](https://i.imgur.com/6Qw7H1r.jpg) 🚀 
[CCJ](https://i.imgur.com/cRfL0e8.jpg) 🚀 

Lots of bearish hedge activity on each of these too, which can be a good sign, but also may mean the expected catalyst is fragile. 

****

**Sector trends in whale bets/UOA I’ve picked up that mean something to me:**

1) **Chips**: It could be SEMICON, but all chip manufacturers are beginning to have more and more otm bets placed on them.  Chip shortage bla bla, but it could be time for them to make another run after getting snuffed out the past few times.

[AMD](https://i.imgur.com/hvbe8gi.jpg) [MU](https://i.imgur.com/1lEpm6e.jpg) [AMAT](https://i.imgur.com/u7oUKbg.jpg) [INTC](https://i.imgur.com/auM5FBs.jpg) 

**2) Steel and stuff**: Lots of activity around both [X](https://i.imgur.com/MzjfGZE.jpg) and [FCX](https://i.imgur.com/ywSP4kW.jpg) (including this X UOA way OTM), among other materials.  I'd venture that infrastructure is about to become a crucial frontier in the post-stimmy administration and now is the time to hop in.  I may follow some UOA on the X monthly, 30c.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR; For stock buyers(not call buyers) A Gamma squeeze might happen in a matter of minutes pushing the stock to 15$+ today!**

Institutional shorts were very ruthless last week. It's almost like they are willing to do anything to keep their hands on the 10$+ option premiums of 03/19/2021. While the short interest for this month isn't out yet, Below is the short volume of the last week and you can do the Math! : 

&#x200B;

[Last weeks  short volume! \(if you are on your phone click me to see it\)](https://preview.redd.it/klinj3jkz0o61.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a1044ef8960e9b2d6c7456e35b63ce13fd25d3f)

If you can't do the math, these numbers are insane! For comparison, yesterday $AMC (which is a heavily shorted stock too) had a short volume of only 14.23 and the day before it was 13.98!! **We were sitting at 32.09 yesterday!**

# For today, what might happen at market close you may ask?

One of two things, if a large number of Apes **buy a lot of shares(not calls because they are worthless in my opinion)**, and the stock is pushed and held over 10$, **approximately 4,598,600 shares million shares will print**(due to previous calls) and the **stock will moon** to the next mile stone 11$ where **approx 1,679,300 can print**, then another major mile stone 12.5$ where **4,952,200 shares can print** and we can go on and on until **15$.** **So, literally the stock could rise to 15$ in a matter of minutes if people buy shares not calls! (Gamma Squeeze)**

[$UWMC option chain.](https://preview.redd.it/64iuw7li41o61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c7f42683d46dd299c95b9bb21e3ec536379b6ce)

The other thing which might happen, **the shorts win for today because of greedy retards who literally gave their money away to call sellers**... But their win would be **temporary** for this week.(in my opinion)

# This part is more important than any catalyst for $UWMC!

I can go on and on about $UWMC catalysts and numbers indicating that it's undervalued, but I won't do it this time because it's too obvious. If a stock is undervalued it will remain undervalued until people(buyers) buy it for higher prices and make it reach to prices where they think the stock should be valued at. 

Take for example $AMC, it's literally a failed business and there's no denying that. Moreover, there isn't any upcoming catalysts or good news, infact it's more probable that the bad news will be more than the good news, and while people know that, they still value it at 25$+ because they believe in what they are buying. If it was up to WallStreet, it would be valued $AMC at 1$, but today it's 14$ because apes decided that it's worth more.

How did $AMC achieve that? In my opinion, a group of Apes banded together and bombarded all social media platforms promoting buying $AMC. Every single post matters and when people start seeing $AMC everywhere, they are more likely to buy it and follow the herd.

**(MOST IMPORTANT PART) If you write in WSB $UWMC right now, you will see a ton of posts everyday. It's starting to gain popularity and it's an actual value play not only a meme stock like the others. If you really believe in $UWMC, you can start posting $UWMC posts on any Social media platform, make your own DD, or share $UWMC posts to give this stock more exposure. If people believe in it as much as you do, they might buy it and we can hopefully all eat Tendies on the Moon(soon)🚀🌕**

**A big platform in my opinion that a lot of people are ignoring is StockTwits. I think if $UWMC trends there(from post volume), this stock can moon easily.**

Anyway, **My short term Price target is still 39$** 🚀🌕",['TGT']

Heres the scoop. 

1: UWMC is going to be included into the Russel 1000 and 3000 indexes on 3/22 (Monday)

2: Analyst EOY ratings range from $10.50 to $14. Average is $12.33.

3. They’re steadily growing, have a great track record and the industry is booming with no signs of stopping anytime soon.

m8odcj,,wallstreetbets,post,1616180402,"Please stop using IBorrowDesk as your only source of hedge funds borrowing sharesLike all of you, I've been looking at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) to keep an eye on the amount of shares remaining for hedge funds to borrow. However, about a week ago I decided that my brain was just a little too smooth (my wife's boyfriend told me to wrinkle up, whatever that means), and I took a look at the FAQ on the iborrowdesk website.

Link for the lazy [https://iborrowdesk.com/faq](https://iborrowdesk.com/faq)

At the very bottom, the FAQ says the following:

""It's also worth noting that IBorrowDesk only tracks Interactive Brokers data - it could be that other brokerages have many shares available. Professional or institutional investors have access to data sources far more sophisticated than this site - which can only track a single, albeit very large and active, brokerage.""

At first I was confused, and picked my nose with an axe. Then, I had a jimmy nerdtron brainblast, and realized this meant that IBorrowDesk does not showcase all of the available shares to borrow for shorting purposes. Investigating the amount of shares available to borrow from other brokers is key to monitoring what the hedge funds are up to. Relying solely on IBorrowDesk is incomplete data at best, and confirmation bias at worst.

I am not a financial advisor, but I want people to be aware that they're not looking at the full data.

And if you aren't a rapper, an athlete, or a Duke brother, you never even think of their product. But you can still make money. ($RYCEY)Hi all, NrdRage  here. Just FYI, today's DD was going to be $RKUNY, but they had a  massive pop earlier this week, and the trade is no longer interesting in  the short term.  Then I thought $VWAGY, but the same thing happened on Wednesday. So instead, I give you this flaming bag of dogshit  instead.

What if I told you that you had the opportunity to invest in a company that has been around since 1906.  And what if I told you that this company, which has been around for 115  years, loses spectacularly large amounts of money - in fact, only  having positive earnings in two quarters since 2018? Oh, and they make  amazingly bad products which are shockingly unreliable, to boot?  Products that you can't afford and will never own? And that they've  diluted themselves to 8.37 BILLION shares of stock, absolutely none of  which is really held by company insiders who have an opportunity to bet  on themselves? Pretty amazing, right?

Let's talk about Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY), cause you're probably gonna buy some by the time this is over.

# Let's get this shitshow started, shall we?

So  all of you know them from their ridiculously expensive vehicles, which I  wouldn't take over a Honda if the trip mattered because they break down  so often. But consumer automotives  isn't really where they ""make"" their money - to use the term very  loosely. As a matter of fact, this company doesn't even make those  pieces of shit anymore - BMW does. No, these fucktards have 4 different  divisions: Civil aeronautics (50% of their revenue), Defense systems  (25%), marine and aeronautic power systems (20%), and IT-pee aeronautics  (uhhhh, math for smoothbrain).  In short, they're a defense contractor who also bolts on pretty  unreliable engines onto passenger jets to try and get you to Vegas as  you try to spend 2 days pretending  you're not some basic bitch who's gone from raging against the machine  to raging against the washing machine. Except you're not nearly as hot  as Stacy's mom.

# Pretend  I'm saying shit about their story and any unique aspects about them or  that anything they do is remotely interesting here. They don't, so I'm  not going to try to make it happen, but usually this is where I put  that. Moving on....

# Looking under the hood...or inside the cowling, as it were.

The  financials of this company are, frankly, abominably bad. They lost over  7 billion dollars last year. They operate at a negative-40% profit  margin. They have less than 5 billion dollars in the bank. In the immortal words of Spose, this company has the swagger of a cripple.  Demand for  jet engines completely dried up by the time Nancy Pelosi was trying to  get you to go to Chinatown to celebrate Chairman Mao during CNY last  year, and it only got worse the longer this whole virus thing dragged  on. No flights not only means  no planes and no demand for engines but, more importantly, no demand  for expensive maintenance contracts to keep those engines from blowing  up. 50% of their revenue comes from consumer air travel. Their forward guidance was some of the worst damp-handed beta cuckery I've heard in a long time.  They've already  come out and said they'll be LUCKY if they generate 50% of the revenue  they generated pre pandemic even after we get back to normal because of  the obliteration of business travel. They've diluted themselves into  oblivion, so they have to borrow money rather than raise it. And  countries not named United States of America have largely decided to  make up for their deficits in revenue as a result of completely  obliterating their economies by reducing spend in the military space, so  the Royal Navy ain't  exactly buying a bunch of their engines, either. The only thing less  sexy about this company is your wife in a negligee. Seriously, I get  that even ugly girls need love, but can't you put a bag over her head or  something? And one for your whole body too, you fat fuck. Oh, and did I  mention that they make mostly widebody engines in a world in which most  airplanes are going narrow body? So there's that.

More  importantly, even though the vast majority of the industry of the world  has kind of recovered their stock prices, RYCEY is presently at a  whopping $1.76, down from their pre-virus highs of about 12.50

# This is a joke, right? You're fucking clowning us to see how much you can get away with, aren't you you sick fuck?

Not  even remotely a joke. I mean, you are a clown, but I'm not clowning  you. I'm dead serious. Buying this company is a good idea.

Why?

Because  the saving grace their shitty products have is that their competition  ($GE, Pratt & Whitney - aka $RTX) make an even SHITTIER product.  P&W, in particular, has gotten under the microscope recently because  the 4077 engines they slapped on UAL's 777's started falling apart.  Remember this?

[Look out below!](https://preview.redd.it/7m9slpqjwzn61.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca799f0bbb649cf9c5b4448e52fe935994d35292)

$RYCEY  might be able to start putting their products on those beasts. $GE  slaps a GE90 on that same plane and, though thankfully none of those  have exploded yet (well, I mean, except for that one that got shot with a  rocket near Russia...but I digress...well, and I'm sure that Malaysian one that is chilling with Amelia Earhart probably exploded on impact), they're a maintenance headache.  On and on down the line we go, they've all got their quirks. Rolls, for  their credit, hangs its hat on their Trent 1000 engine, which is what  keeps the Dreamliners  in the air. Course, they're famous for fatigue cracking and have to be  inspected every 80 flights (down from an average of about 200 for the  industry) because they're so unreliable. Their one home run engine got  slapped on the A380, and then that whole plane got canceled like it had made an at-the-time milquetoast insensitive Tweet 15 years ago even though  it's the best bird in the sky.

This  is all a long way of saying they all have issues, but RR has slightly  fewer issues. Thankfully for them, airlines, not wanting to be sued, are  willing to pay up lots of money for service agreements, and that makes  up an insane amount of their revenue. You know, when the planes are  flying. One positive thing they have going for them is the A350 is going  to exclusively be using their engines, so they've got that going for  them. Matter of fact, they just recently locked down an exclusive  agreement to be the provider of that bird's engines until 2030 at the  earliest, which is a huge win. Plus it gives them time to figure out why their Ultrafan engines (which are supposed to replace the Trents) are such miserable piles of garbage.

# So why are they a good investment (and price targets)?

Well,  in practicality, they're not really, but in a market that is strongly  indicating it's way overbought, this is one of the very few companies  that hasn't had its turn at the recovery wheel on the stonk markets. With a 52 week  low of 1.31, they're presently only sitting about 40 cents off that  mark, and most of that has happened in the last couple of weeks. We've  seen the airline stocks start to fly recently, and $BA has been on an  absolute tear, so logically speaking, $RYCEY is kind of next soyboy up. Quick, name 5 stocks trading anywhere near their 52 week lows? Do I think they're going to get back to their pre-virus valuation of 12-16 a share? Fuuuuuck  no. They're really badly managed and air travel is forever changed,  which is going to really put a dent in their forward revenues

BUT....there's  not a doubt in my mind that they're going to see $3.40 in the VERY near future, $4 in the slightly near future and I would be positively shocked if they aren't at 8 by the end  of the year, which means you can catch a 4-bagger on these guys while  you laugh about how the absolute worst company in your portfolio is, on a  share basis, one of your best performers. Because laughing about that  is easier than crying about how your wife's boyfriend recently informed  you that he was upgrading to a 3.

Stupidly, my price targets are actually below that of most analysts, and those guys always undersell.

# Technical analysis:

There  is none! All my charts were for $RKUNY, and I'm not going to spend 20  minutes creating charts showing this thing's price action, especially  since the charts are ugly as fuck due to the fact that the stock only  moves in increments of fractional pennies in spite of having a 14 billion dollar market cap.

&#x200B;

OK ok, ONE chart.  This is a daily going back to last July.  Teal is the XMA and the dark blue line is the SMA. The nude line is a 200 SMA and not relevant to this discussion.  You can see it recovered a little (off chart) and then when ""wave 2"" hit, fell off a cliff again, and then gapped down hard at the end of November.  Since that point, it has largely been consolidating, but has tested the 1.31 low no fewer than 10 times, holding that support each time.  Since mid February, it's been on a slow but steady climb to fill that gap created in November at 3.40.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?

Simple: SHARES! It's the only way you CAN play it, because there's no options chain for this dog.

Ya  know, the longer I write this, the more it seems like I'm kind of  phoning this one in, but given the subject matter, I think that's  entirely appropriate. If you're asking yourself why, well, this one is  about to start making its climb upwards as more people start packing  into planes. Plus, until this whole Gamestop thing is over with, those fucking apes keep downvoting anything that's not Gamestop.

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* Shitty company....
* with even shittier competitors
* Didn't get to take part in the economic recovery in the markets; still trading a lot closer to 52 week lows than highs
* Has some guaranteed gubmint money, and is doing Playstation-like exclusives with certain planes for their engines
* Shares only
* Gives you the bragging rights of saying you're such a good investor that you made money on the dollar general of the Aerospace world

# Position Disclaimers:

\-500,000  shares at $1.72. Up until very recently, I was actually underwater on  this one (Edit:  As of this morning, I'm flat on it again). It dropped 11 cents yesterday and that was actually  significant enough to where it put a huge dent in the price. I have  absolutely no intention of buying more. This position represents less  than 1% of my fun money portfolio, so I'm not terribly interested in it,  but I know it's going to make me money, and that's all I care about.

All my love

m8oppv,,wallstreetbets,post,1616181339,"Cries of ""Gamification"" = Narcissism (from big market players) and Scapegoating (from officials)Disclaimer: first post to WSB. I'm not a stock wiz, just an aging ape. I started watching the market mid-2000s as a Project Manager at a company that did big data UI/UX for Goldman Sachs and many of their ""competitors"". 

I also completely avoided the markets for a long time after I left that job in 2009 (going back to internet tech companies). 

Plenty of us here already know this stuff. But WSB is seen outside Reddit these days. There is value in stating the following propagate the idea. 

...

In this weeks hearings we heard a many cries about the market being ""gamified"". No doubt this term was even more effective because of the name of the biggest stock in the ""meme stock"" movement (another term used to scapegoat WSB). 

Most of us here know the market was ""gamified"" a long time ago. Deregulation of the markets goes back at least to the 1980s. The governing bodies never revisited this in a meaningful way. Yes, Dodd-Frank and similar tried to bolster the market fundamentals but at higher levels all sorts of shennanigans were allowed. And the on-going defenestration of the SEC and related agencies allowed things to get worse over time. 

The big funds were able to ""game"" the system LONG before the masses caught on. The public has been suspicious the market was rigged for a long time but it was a vague ""feeling"" until recently. There weren't big examples of how ONLY the big funds could do it in the public's consciousness (aside from crap like ""too big to fail""). 

The big market players tried to ""game"" GME and the other ""meme stocks"". They got caught. Retail reacted. 

And now Retail gets constantly griped at for ""gamification"". But we're just taking the open seat to play chess as Black versus the big player who got seated first. 

...

Things are changing, but, only in the sense that retail is *starting* to catch up. 

The retail side is finally getting tools to figure obscure things out. New tools come out weekly. One recent example is Tiblio (note: I have zero connection to them and don't sub to theirs or any other service, I just wanted a recent example). And we have a ton of worthy DD coming in to various subs and Discords on a daily basis that even the big market players are paying attention to. 

But the big boys? 

They had these tools not years but ***decades*** ago. 

I helped build a few of these tools in the mid-2000s (see my disclaimer above about my work history). All my projects there were to update *existing tools and data* (ie, we were converting them to Web2.0 APIs). These tools had been around and available since the first financial web sites went up and grew into HUGE databases. 

90% of our data was never accessible to the general public. What was available was made available at the discretion of the big trading companies since it was hosted on their sites. 

The biggest tool I worked on was never a public-facing tool. It was a massive collation tool that combined data from dozens of databases to help visualize and predict future trends (never really worked well because the data from so many sources needed to be rationalized and it was a brutal task). It was only ever available for the internal use of those trading companies. And it involved petabytes of data back when a petabyte was considered amazing. 

Side note: for a little extra perspective I was working at this company through 2008. I got to watch the Volkswagen squeeze as well as the market crash from this really weird perspective (most of us were employed by an independent subsidiary of Goldman but our top management had more direct ties ... and some of them were VERY stressed on Bear Stearns day). 

My point? 

The market has been gamified for a long time. We just weren't allowed to see the rules and the plays. 

... 

To get back to the title (should be a TLDR but I type too much):

It's different depending on who it comes from for this reason:

* Big market players ...  are tossing out the word ""gamification"" because they know it is *what they've been doing* and because it gets a rise out of the politicians. This is a power-play common to Narcissistic Sociopaths. 

How do you notice that is what is happening? Because you say to yourself ""no, that's not what I've done ... that's what *you've* done ... you're deflecting blame"". 

* Politicians ... latch on to the word. They know somewhere inside that they've been seeing this ""gamification"" happen for a long time but have been too intimidated to attach that word to the big market players that started it. 

Calling out the big boys is dangerous to politicians. But soon as retail has access to the ""game"" the politicians can 'tsk-tsk' and wag their fingers at us saying it's wrong. Having a scapegoat gives them a way to look like they are being proactive while protecting the big market players. 

Note: I'm quite happy with some of the politicians that have been willing to *at least* call out both sides. I'm not saying ""all"" officials are like this.

... 

In the end are we playing the game? Only because we have to, otherwise we like the stock. The stock *wouldn't be a power play if the game hadn't been set up*. 

We didn't create the game. If we'd been given the option to play equal to our financial state in a fair market for the last 15 years vs. having to find things like GME shorts ... I am pretty confident the majority here would have picked the fair markets. WSB might not even exist and if it did it would be in the thousands, not millions, of subscribers. 

Politicians need to grok this. They need to focus on core market problems. Big market players will always do what is in their interests, so I don't ever expect them to quit trying to deflect. 

People who make the rules need to keep their eyes open about where the problems are really coming from.",

I hope you're all doing great and have popcorn nearby for tomorrow.

Like last time, I am going to explain you what you can see on the different pictures step by step, or picture by picture in this case.



PICTURE 1:

https://preview.redd.it/wgfpkk1s4tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf17c0c0a7c6164dbd996fadbb783719340a079

In the first picture, we don't really see a difference compared to my last screenshots. We see a decline in sellers, which is obviously good, and a small increase of institutional involvement, also good. No negative data.



PICTURE 2:

https://preview.redd.it/hzvspcs66tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed4244b5cd2bcc90c1140300a0a0b9de9d3ac0ef

I find it quite funny, that we can see a spanish asset manager buying call options which also expire tomorrow. Just like the idea, that some of the hedgies want other hedgies to be smashed. They don't really have a huge position and won't have any big impact on the price of GME. All other options you can see are outdated and the accuracy of these options cannot be granted. Don't try to speculate, since you cannot tell whether they're still in or not.

For all of you who don't know what call options are, the spanish asset manager bets that the price of GME will be above 200$ tomorrow, which would definitely be amazing for us apes. I am explaining in the following pictures why exactly.



PICTURE 3:

https://preview.redd.it/opnh5k177tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bede88f52d218976b6f0cff114ba4ce8fa52d1b1

Okay so, this is where the important stuff is displayed. We can see that 11,681 options are expiring tomorrow if the price hits 250$, which is currently not the case. (GME at 211$ while I'm writing this DD). This would mean at this point over 2509 call options COULD, not have to, execute tomorrow ~ 250k shares COULD be bought. Keep in mind, that most people don't execute their calls, but rather just sell them.

Important info: I am only taking into account call options from 160$ - 250$ as you can see, since I didnt want to add all the amounts from 100$ to idk where. So you can expect that there are at least over 1000 options expiring aswell at the strike price of 100$. But I know some would argue about this, and this is why I am just calculating with the options shown in the screenshot.



SO: If GME hits 250$ by tomorrow over 1,2 mio shares COULD be bought, assuming that all people execute the calls, but this doesn't really has a huge importance since marketmakers begin to buy shares already in case of someone executes his options. 1,2 mio shares being bought at the same point, or even half of it -> huge price jump. But also 100k or 200k shares would create a price jump and therefore COULD lead to the so-called gamma squeeze (hitting higher stock prices, causing other options to be in the money, and so on). I don't say that it for sure will cause a gamma squeeze. It just could end up in the situation we're all striving for.



PICTURE 4:

https://preview.redd.it/t7m7flh59tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f98da6a0969261cbe0dc220bc4a1ef24ffb4b21b

Okay so, now we come to the point where you can clearly see why it's kind of important for GME to be over 200$ by tomorrow. If GME is UNDER 200$ TOMORROW, over 12k put options (1,2 mio shares) CAN be executed, which would cause a price drop. That doesn't automatically mean that the gamma squeeze possibility is non-existent anymore, but it would definitely mean that we would have to wait for the next expiration date to let it happen. It also doesn't mean that everyone really executes his options, since like I said, most of them never get executed.



Now we come to the huge BUT part:

IF GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW, WE HAVE NEARLY NO PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE OF ANY IMPORTANCE ANYMORE. This means, that there would really be no huge downward pressure on the price, outgoing from options, if it starts to rise. You can check this by yourself on other platforms. There are not a lot put calls on GME over the strike price of 200$.





Picture 5:

https://preview.redd.it/ofxur2biatn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=681866a6b46249f775ac5ddefd2c900cb4135d64

This is again very interesting imo, since we can clearly see, that the ETF objectives increased their positions by over 10%. OVER 10% !!! Since Blackrock owns almost 10mio shares which are mostly in ETFs (I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN BLOOMBERG RESEARCH BUT YOU CAN OFC JUST DONT TRUST ME. THEN IGNORE THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE) , I ASSUME that BLACKROCK (LARGEST ASSET MANAGER IN THE WORLD) is on our side and wants GME to skyrocket. Very good information, so do I think. We also see an overall increase in positions, except from one fund objective, the value fund objective (betting on stocks that are in their opinion undervalued). I know there were a lot of posts about Blackrock being on Citadels site. Which is just as likely. I don't have more information than you have. But Blackrock is the biggest shareholder of GME and has most of its stocks in ETFS.

The ETF increase could also just mean that another Hedgefund, not called Blackrock, increased their position in ETFs. Everything is possible.



Last picture:

https://preview.redd.it/7mlji2q9btn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=947b90a1993cf426da98ee679e8732a10dfd82e7

This really contains no helpful information, but I just want to show you that all short sellers stopped reporting short interest since the 02/26/2021 (When GME started to rise from 40$ on february 22nd to 265$ on march 10th.). Although short interest usually got reported on the 15th each month, we still have no recent reports. Seems a bit sketchy, imo. But this could also just mean nothing.



I don't want to get anybody buy GME due to my posts, since I am mostly making assumptions here and personally just find it really suspicious. I know we all find the situation really suspicious.



I THANK EVERYBODY FOR READING THIS AND WHICH ALL OF US GOOD LUCK IN THE WAR! I AM HYPED FOR POWER HOUR AND IF GME IS ABLE TO STAY ABOVE 200$. but keep in mind, we have many evidences, that other HFs are on our side, besides from my assumptions that Blackrock wants GME to skyrocket. Please read other DD's if you want to have more info about this topic particularly. I can recommend DD's by u/HeyItsPixel about this topic.



HAVE A NICE EVENING EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOU ALL.



PS: Holy shit this really took me an hour to make.



EDIT: GME DOES NOT HAVE TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW! THIS ALSO DOESNT MEAN THAT ""GME IS OVER"" OR SOME SH** IF IT CLOSES UNDER 200. I WILL HOLD MY SHARES UNTIL GME HITS 1 MIL. I DONT CARE IF IT IS TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR. PLEASE DONT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT I SAID THAT GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE A SPECIFIC RANGE**. I WANTED TO SAY THE GAMMA SQUEEZE IS MOST LIKELY TO EXPECT TOMORROW OR MONDAY WHEN GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW SINCE MOST OPTIONS EXPIRE ON MARCH 19th which is information we already had a long time ago. I held my shares while being at -90% and I will hold them until they're at +69,420%. My personal opinion.**

EDIT 2 : My main goal is not to motivate you, promise you anything or predict anything. My intention of my every two-day Bloomberg updates are to show you how the market does and if retail is selling or anything. That’s all. If you’re not interested in my text, don’t read it and just look at the screenshots and make your own opinions. I know, that not all options have to be executed and most of them probably are not being executed.

EDIT 3: I also did not say that Blackrock IS FOR SURE ON OUR SIDE, but Blackrock is the one having most shares embedded in ETFs. And as you can see, the positions in ETFs increased by 10%. This also COULD MEAN THAT ANOTHER HEDGEFUND OR ASSET MANAGER JUST INCREASED THEIR POSITION!! Don't get me wrong, PLEASE!

For real, it just makes me sad that so many people misunderstand me and think ""I am one of them"", ""trying to say that GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ tomorrow or it crashes"" or say that I said ""all options are for sure being exectued"". I never said such things and that was never my intention. I am not going to make any more updates.

TL;DR:

IF GME ABOVE 200$ PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF. IF UNDER: GET YOUR MONEY TOGETHER CUZ ITS A FIRE SALE

We're missing about 20 minutes.

""Ahh, you crayon-eating poop-brain, they edited out all the cuts, breaks and stuff like that"" I hear you saying. Yep! But also, CNBC fucks also did some extra shillwork on it.

At 02:38:19 (original video) - French Hill comes on and during his 5 minutes, he has doubts about separation of Citadel's businesses. In the CNBC version THERE IS NO FRENCH HILL. ERASED.

At 02:45:59 (original video) - Cindy Axne comes on and during her 5 minutes asks about RH and Citadel's spreads, business practices. CNBC keeps about 5% of her time in their version of the video, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS CUT.

You can go check it out yourselves, it's there for everybody to see.

We already knew they weren't clean, but tampering with a congressional hearing video? Is it just me or do you also smell desperation?

We all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much money, who wouldn't?

We all look and wonder if we'll ever make so much money in our lives, probably not, we think to ourselves.

But DFV was just a regular user of Reddit two years ago.

He was convinced of his ideas, had some cash, and fell in love with this company, as we all have.

Sure, he bought in at a much lower price, but that's not really what sets this man apart from most of us.

One of the secrets to his success was... his diamond hands and balls.

He was ridiculed for such a ""stupid"" investment - who would yolo his money in a ""failing brick and mortar company""?

He was subjected to FUD daily, he lived through some horrible earnings reports, and yet

he **held.**

He held because when a strong man/woman is convinced of his ideas nothing can distract him  - nothing can destroy him.

And that is what I also want to be. That is what I am going to be.

I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I'm here today.

I won't let myself down just because I see some red days (or green days!).

No matter how things will turn out to be. No matter how red a day / week / month will be.

I will **hold.**

This is why these companies will eventually have constant dividend and not reinvest back into the company expansion. Makes for good retirement investment where you want constant income. On the other hand, tech companies need to have either a new technology/product or have some way to digitally transform the industry that can quickly scale.

RKT has spent billions of dollars creating their own broker tools that's customizable, as well as investing in data analytics and AI-assisted automation. They have a 2500-strong software team in Detroit. RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app (although I've heard their app is pretty good). Just look at their acquisitions and some of their other businesses:

1. Nexsys Technologies makes a platform for mortgage lenders that automate homeowner insurance verification, and is being integrated with Lemonade
2. Lendesk, a Canadian aquisition that makes end-to-end digital mortgage solutions
3. forsalebyowner is a property listing site, kinda like zillow and redfin
4. Finally, their flagship rocket mortgage/quicken loans is the first digital mortgage experience - they are the ones who brought on the digital revolution of the mortgage industry. They are the real OGs and are continuing to innovate.

If you think Lemonade is a tech company (it is), then RKT is a tech company. Even more, it's a tech company that has succeeded in its own field and is rapidly expanding/acquiring. 

On the other hand, everyone is familiar with the feud between RKT and UWMC, and arguments for which is a better company. While I think UWMC has done well in recent year in terms of rapidly expanding in the broker channel, I don' think they are a tech company and thus shouldn't have a long term high forward valuation. Their flagship platform for brokers, Blink+, is a third party software that they pay per use (see their [S1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-016729/)). So here they save the initial investment that makes the finances look better for IPO, but will eat into their margins later.",

m8olrf,grikmuy,wallstreetbets,comment,1616182868,"Watching people *actually shill* for companies like this warms my heart. You did your research, too.

Most WSB ""meme stocks"" are meant to be bought low and sold high. You see Rocket Mortgage as an *actual investment* that will grow in the future.

As you are taking this as a real investment, here is the advice I can give:

1. **Reinvest the dividends.** Not all stocks do this, but if they do, make sure you ask your broker (or the  ""Robin Hood"" App, etc.) to do this automatically. This accrues stock without spending more money.

2. ***""Diamond Hands"" is NOT just a meme!*** **Prepare to buy and hold for decades.** Resisting the urge to fold and panic sell when stocks fall is something that Mauldin Economics says takes discipline that few men have. Having true Diamond Hands is extremely rare, especially when bubbles pop. It is easy to say it and hard to do it. A man that bought a few hundred shares of Johnson-Johnson when it first went public in the forties would have tens of millions of dollars today, and even more if he followed the previous point. Maybe Rocket Mortgage could be your Johnson-Johnson? Only time and Diamond Hands will tell.

3. One of my favorite economists said that if you are a really savvy investor AND an investor with Diamond Hands, **you should not need to check you portfolio every day, or even every week**. You should not constantly obsess over your long-term investments. You are in it for the long run; Diamond Hands pay the best over MANY years! Ideally, you don't intensely follow it until you are very old.

4. **Start saving for retirement the day you get your first job. Do not put your life savings in stock alone.** With hardcore Diamond Hands and reinvesting the dividends, stocks can legitimately be a real source of wealth. That doesn't mean you should not diversify into other stocks and stable investments like real estate.

5. **If your job ever offers stock options, take them.** A stock option is a contract guaranteeing a certain price at which you are allowed to purchase a set number of shares. There is no better deal than this if you think your employer is going somewhere.

6. **You WILL lose money in some investments. Stock markets are casinoes: as with any gambling,** ***NEVER invest money you cannot afford to completely lose,*** **and never, EVER take loans to invest in stocks.**

7. **Buy bonds.** Bonds are boring and make small interest payments, but they always work. They don't give much money, but unless you're into ""bonks"" and not good bonds (AKA junk bonds and insolvent corporations' bonds), you will ALWAYS turn a profit.


You are taking this very seriously and I LOVE to see such optimism and enthusiasm in investing. I LOVE watching other people make money! You already demonstrated your research and are probably going to expand on it. Take this advice to heart and invest prudently.

I hope that, one day, when you've worked all your life and you finally retire, you will look back at WSB and your choices and relish in the fact that you put your money to work.

Happy investing! May your fortunes fly to the moon and may your hands never fold!",

m7ya85,,wallstreetbets,post,1616094452,"Why I think $GME is still bullish and going to moonFellow apes, I know many of you, me included, have been through some tough days and hours. Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. 

I want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I'm talking about - I'm really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. 

But still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that's basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. 

So when you're looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we're pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a support and we're not letting it fall below my fellow apes!

Furthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. 

Last but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be soon! 

As you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I'm stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won't sell before we reach at least four digits! 

TL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement soon. I like the stock and you should like it too.

Edit: Some of you have pointed out we shouldn't put dates on our analysis and I must say I agree. Although I see a very good chance of upward movement soon, we shouldn't link this to today or Monday. This might be a long time play, just see when DFV started posting about his YOLOs, this wasn't for the short term.",['DOW']

**my smallstreetbets positions along with account rollercoaster**: https://imgur.com/a/kE402fQ



**Week of January 15th**

1. Gotten broken up with by a long time girlfriend of mine two weeks before GME exploded the first time. Had come right on the heels of a trip we took together to Fresno. Was absolutely crushed and still am, probably the worst pain of my life. Mentioning this just for timing sake.

2. Have to give my young cat away because I wasn't able to provide a proper situation for him. Was a call I made on my own and I think it was the right one, but was devastating nonetheless. “Man up you fucking pussy!” Yeah I get it, but I raised that fucker from 4 weeks to a year old and he had my entire heart. His name was Shrimp.

3. Have been dealing with a rampant roach infestation at my apartment that has been unaddressed by my landlord. My apartment is pretty spotless and still these demons roam every crevice of my apartment. I've had exterminators come out 3 times, and each time the roaches return like my faith in GME. I live in Koreatown LA, paying $1600 a month which is fucking retarded for Koreatown. I am a musician/music producer full-time, so money is already tight and I signed this lease thinking I was getting a steal – I'm gonna say this a lot throughout this post but I'm a fucking idiot. I also had forced entry into my apartment twice in one week during this period. This has gone completely unaddressed by my landlord and they haven't replied to any of my calls or emails about it. I still get crazy anxiety about that situation, something about your door getting unlocked with a key in the wee-hours of the morning and having no explanation for who it was is super unnerving. Both times I was mid-sleep so I didn't see who or what the fuck was going on. I don't have the money to fight a legal battle so I'm just thugging it out in this fucking shitbox until further notice.

GME starts to explode two weeks later, rode that shit from my cost basis of $60 all the way up to $500 and didn't sell – the true sign of my retardation; I should've stopped here. The most money I've ever had in my possession was about $7,000 – my account skyrocketed to almost 50k at its peak. Ended up riding it all the way back down and selling most of my shares between $90 and $60. Still made out with a little profit which was huge for me at the time so even though I was fucking gutted I tried to look on the bright side. But those weeks from January 15th to early February were an absolute roller-coaster of emotion.  pretty much spent the entirety of february getting stoned out of my fucking mind and doing jack shit.  i was down BAD. silver linings however though, i've been smoking weed pretty much daily since i was 14, i just turned 27 early march.  this whole ordeal got me to completely quit smoking, and i'm 3 weeks clean as of now! thats fucking huge for me.

**End of February / Early March**

I decide to get back in as I see GME start to creep up. Fuck YES, it's happening again and this time I know not to be greedy, I know to take profit and scale out where I feel comfortable; and hold what I think could go further. Well, I ended up making a decent little profit on that run from around $140-280. I didn't play everything correctly and paper-handed a bit along the way, but overall I was happy I made out with a small profit again. Keep in mind I am going full ape through all this shit, literally putting every bit of money I have into $GME. I'm collecting unemployment benefits, but I'm putting every dime into the stock during these periods. This whole time I've also only been paying 25% of the rent each month because I'm able to with the COVID situation, so I have payments to catch up on spanning all the way back to December. In my mind if I was able to keep more of my cash in the market I stood the chance to make much more, right? I'm a fucking idiot, you see where this is going.

**March 10th – Now**

I cashed out and sold at $280 on March 10th (I could be wrong about the timing/date) Hooray! I timed it perfectly. I had about 6k to my name total and I was super proud of myself, I didn't get greedy, I made a little money and although I probably disappointed some apes I was ready to buy back in whenever the bottom came. The catalysts were there and I genuinely believed in it, so I was strapped in. So I did – I YOLO'd all the money I had besides what I needed for food + gas. I believe I bought back in at $260 or so thinking the stock would stick around that area with all the catalysts and potential news around the corner. Then shit started dropping, so I sold for a loss. I bought back in again, thinking THIS was the bottom. NOPE. Once a diamond handed autist, turned to a paper-handed bitch. I had taken a big loss and I needed to find a way to get it back, plus I assumed the stock was going to keep dropping and I wanted to have a good chance to pickup cheap shares so I bought some short dated puts hoping to regain some of my account and have more rocket fuel for when the ACTUAL bottom hit. This is probably my biggest fuckup throughout this entire thing. I lost around $4500 in 2 days. Timed it completely fucking wrong and saw all my GME gains and more wiped away, everything. Your probably wondering how the fuck I managed to lose that much on puts when the stock has been dropping steadily the past few days. I have no fucking clue either, just pure autism I guess. I'm a fucking idiot.

So as it stands, I have pretty much the remainder of my cash in GME AGAIN, my current cost average is $225 and $220 between the two brokerage accounts I have. I put my stimmy in on Wednesday (despite promising myself I'd put it towards a new computer that I need to keep my music alive) and have continued to watch it drop. Stockholm Syndrome + a gambling addiction at its finest. I'm completely fucked. I don't have money to pay rent, I don't have any job prospects that I can see, and because I'm completely self-employed I have an enormous tax bill coming up. I have never been this crushed in my entire life. I am preparing for homelessness as soon as I get out of this roach den, and I'm not sure what the future will hold for me. I haven't contemplated ending it, but its taken every bit of my strength to wake-up everyday realizing how bad of a hole I've gotten myself into.

**WHY I MADE THIS POST** :

If you made it this far, congratulations! You might be as retarded as I am. The reason I made this post was to address what WSB and the apes have meant to me throughout this entire thing.

Since I moved to LA last October I've struggled to make real friends out here and develop a sense of community. It has been a bit of a struggle on that end. But throughout the crushing times of the last two months, I don't think I've **EVER** laughed as hard or as frequently as I have while engaging with you guys in the GME daily threads, the memes you guys make, the high-production value videos, etc. Holy fuck you guys are a hilarious, determined, generous and loving bunch of apes. From donating to the children's hospitals to sponsoring endangered species – the things I've seen here are incredible and truly heartwarming. One could argue this subs blind love for GME is part of why I fucked myself this hard but that's bullshit, I take full ownership of my decisions. You guys and girls have made this easier for me. I cannot express how important the laughter was for me during this time because obviously even aside from GME I've been going through it - as I'm sure a lot of us have. I don't know who the fuck I've turned into, but I'm sitting here a bit teary eyed thinking about what this sub has meant to me and how you people have kept me going in the most uncertain time of my life. I'm still HODLing my shares like the demonic autist I am but whatever happens, I do not regret joining this place for one second. There are people out there with (obviously) much more awful situations than me, so I'm trying to keep things in perspective. Hoping someday soon I can post gain porn and deliver Nintendo Switches to kids in need, maybe even adopt an ape or two. I may stay off this board for the next couple of weeks, but I'm praying each and every one of us lands on the moon in time.",

FB is the mall. PINS is Costco. Google+ created the wrong product.  


Pinterest 100B Marketcap by 2023. Think about who the customers are, what they’re doing, and why they do it.

# Purpose

Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(DD in Draft Mode)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Fastly DD in Progress)**
* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

## Investing in Internet Forums

Let’s keep one question in mind:

>Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

[Pinterest-as-a-Search-Service](https://preview.redd.it/are6a4e5hxn61.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=a547a926696fc0a7cc5fb3f7bdcaf78be4f7d684)

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

* Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
* Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
* Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways in an attention-economy (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok, Roblox). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming. I also believe that its physical network advantage is growing thinner.

## Searching

Consider this economic relationship.

>What are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Women. Why?

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in product education, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than a local-friendgroup site. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced **interests**, which we will touch on shortly.

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers regardless of culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

\- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)

\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)

\- Skincare ideas (Target, Hims & Hers)

\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)

\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)

\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. **That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.**

[Pinterest users have an incredibly high “willingness to engage” as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else.](https://preview.redd.it/au1vvhl1ixn61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a149db0fd2a541da14c0b813b66b37ee661439)

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

# The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security & Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

[Progressing Web Standards](https://preview.redd.it/fitjijovixn61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fca3cb23f577904e044b7ec996fdfd2bdb87cfc)

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, DDash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities. 

## Summary

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces; as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

Just to add: The bear case is that PINS growth exploded due to pandemic and people sitting at home. In particular there was a shift of consumer spending to home furnishings/ remodeling which are some of PINS most popular uses. Same with things like recipes driven by home cooking. 
Bull counter is that it’s a permanent shift in consumer behavior and PINS users will continue to visit the app, looking for different things (maybe travel ideas in 2021 for instance). And it’s an advertisers dream thus PINS can charge premium prices for space.",
