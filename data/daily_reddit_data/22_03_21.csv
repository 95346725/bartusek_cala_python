mauium,,stocks,post,1616437919,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-unveils-industrys-first-unified-120000258.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-unveils-industrys-first-unified-120000258.html).
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Ai**
   * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD**
   * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD**
   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $ 15.3 billion. Adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

mb52jz,,stocks,post,1616468640,"Why Microsoft would want to acquire Discord, which is reportedly exploring a $10B-plus salehttps://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-want-acquire-discord-reportedly-exploring-10b-plus-sale/

Discord is a popular app used by millions of gamers for low-latency voice chat and other communication. Due to social distancing measures and the general growth of the video game industry, Discord nearly doubled its userbase and saw revenue spike to $130 million in 2020. It was valued at $7 billion in December, and is reportedly is not yet profitable.

That would seem to leave Microsoft as the last real domestic contender here. It has pre-existing ties to Discord, as you can already link your Xbox account directly to the service; it’s certainly got the money, with $131 billion in total cash as of Dec. 31; and it’s reportedly still in the market for more gaming-focused acquisitions, even after finalizing its purchase of ZeniMax Media earlier this month.

This is a positive move to acquire discord. It will make msft more competitive and improve social media business, which might make it able to compete with facebook. It will definitely help the gaming business as well as msft putting more effort to improve the gaming revenue.","['MSFT', 'FB']"

mb14ej,,stocks,post,1616456207,"The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market MakersAs more retail investors become interested in investing in the financial markets, the more information available to the general public, the better.

Recently, there have been some [Congressional hearings in the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html) in the wake of the ongoing Gamestop saga in which questions have been  raised over the practice of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which has become more common and a core part of the business model for no commission trading pioneered by Robinhood.

While  PFOF is not a new practice, it is seemingly becoming more common as  more brokerages follow Robinhood's model in order to compete for the burgeoning retail trading business.  At least in the US, it appears fewer brokerages are now offering the traditional commission based trading structure:  Fidelity, Merrill Edge, Interactive Brokers (but not their newer ""IBKR Lite"" platform) are some examples (are there more?).

PFOF is banned in at least two other jurisdictions: the UK and Canada.

Rightly maligned for his prior fradulent behaviour in his pump and dump ""boiler-room"" schemes where he took up to $200 million from investors, the infamous ""Wolf of Wall Street"" recently gave an interview in which  he discussed the topic at hand, shedding a bit more light on the practice:

[Fortune interview with Jordan Belfort, the ""Wolf of Wall Street""](https://fortune.com/2021/03/21/bitcoin-stock-market-jordan-belfort-small-investors-wolf-of-wall-street-interview/)

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising  how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive  window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information    disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""  
>  
>..  
>  
>In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and  keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

[Bloomberg Opinion Article on Payment for Order Flow](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow)

[Investopedia Article: What is Payment for Order Flow?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp)

>..payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp)—the same Madoff of Ponzi scheme notoriety.  
>  
>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, in a [special study](https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ordpay.htm) on PFOF published in December 2000, “Payment for order flow is a method of transferring some of the trading profits from market making to the brokers that route customer orders to specialists for execution.” 

[Payment for Order Flow is banned in the UK](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/payment-for-order-flow-in-the-united-kingdom)

[Payment for Order Flow is also prohibited in Canada](https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/market-insights/etf/october/2019-10-02-Free-Trading.pdf)

The SEC ultimately decided against banning the practice in the US, citing the potential benefit to investors in encouraging competition that would presumably increase execution quality.

One last link: [the SEC charged Robinhood in 2020 for misleading customers about revenue sources and failing to satisfy the duty of best execution (fining them $65 million).](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

Thanks!",
mb68oo,grwga7k,stocks,comment,1616480094,"I would argue that these are NOT ideal investment for most retail investors. Aside from being an accredited investor (minimum networth/income criteria), there are several practical challenges. 

1. you must pay an inflated premium on valuation from most recent funding. this would also include additional fee from these websites.

2. You dont own the shares directly and cant really see how they are appreciating/depreciating. 

3. Liquidating your shares will be extremely difficult if not impossible. These websites will not buyback the stock from you but try to find another buyer. (Timeshare model anyone?)

4. You dont know when and if the company will ever be public. You lose all of your money if company folds.

5. You dont have any control/visibility on dilution if company decides to raise cash from investors or offer equity to new employee. 

In short, this is NOT for everybody. I would say get into this only if you can invest in multiple pre-ipo companies so that you can make money even if one of them shoots up. But if you can afford to do all that, try being an angel investor and invest in early stage companies where you can get better bang for the buck.",

mb68oo,grwgjbz,stocks,comment,1616480312,"Things in private equity/venture capital do not work the same way as public markets. There is no standard of reporting and “accredited investor” is a proxy for financial literacy. Projections can be extremely rosy and the assumption is you have the ability to dig into things enough to test their projections and push back. 

You’re going to need to understand exactly what you’re buying. Are you buying into a fund (partnership) that owns the company stock? If so, what are the costs, incentives and rights the GP have (could they keep the partnership open even if the stock goes public so you never actually get the shares)? If you’re getting shares directly, where do you sit in the cap structure? Employees are typically granted common stock but each VC round is typically a class of preferred equity that has a liquidation preference above each previous round and all are above the common. If things go well, all the preferred gets converted to common so you need to understand how the dilution works. If things don’t go well or even just ok. The VC firms could potentially sell the company for a value that leaves little to no value for the common equity. 

How do these platforms make their money? Is it a fee to broker the transaction or are they also making a spread (they bought the shares from the employees at $10 and you’re buying from them at $15)?

What information rights do you have? Will you get a financial statement or just a capital account statement (basically just one line of here’s how much money you gave us and here’s its value today with no additional info or context)? Who is providing that statement? How are they arriving at the valuation of what you bought?",
mb68oo,grwejvt,stocks,comment,1616478646,"I’ve gotten close to taking some deals on the platform. 


The problem is that they charge a hefty fee (usually 5%), and the valuation you are offered shares at tends to be very bloated compared to a recent fundraising round. 

I think it’s a fine investment if you really truly believe in the company for the long term, but you certainly aren’t getting any bargains and are taking on tremendous risk.

With the fees and high valuation, you basically need the company to be a true winner long term and end up with it being a blockbuster IPO.",
mb5yst,,stocks,post,1616471700,"How's Your Mind?I was a full-time trader for 7.5 years.  I did it for myself and 3 other investors, we had an LLC formed and I was considered an exempted registered adviser to do what I did.  I had days where I made $5,000 in an hour or two and days I lost not quite that amount but definitely more than most people make in a 2-week paycheck, maybe a month.

I don't say that to brag or anything, simply wanted to say that my POV here might be unique from others as I never worked for a bank/firm but handled individually a rather large account.  From that experience, I realized a few things:

&#x200B;

One, dealing with money is never enough.  The highs and lows go away and soon you're having to go deeper just to get the same feeling as before.  Like an alcoholic who once enjoyed a sip and now needs the bottle, so is someone who's at it only to make or lose more than ever.  Enough is never enough and that ends very very badly for most.

&#x200B;

Two, it's not easy.  Not by a mile.  Every FURU out there tries to make it look easy but they all come with a monthly fee or special course.  If all these people were that good, they wouldn't have to sell a course or charge a fee to make money, they'd just make it in the market.  And please don't get me started about just wanting to have extra sources of income, that's BS and we both know it.

&#x200B;

Three, and most importantly, the mind is everything.  I stopped enjoying myself around year 6 but didn't call it quits till 7.5 years in.  I love the markets but hated the highs and lows.  The money was good but the internet is powerful, there's an infinite number of ways to make money.  So I started selling some of the artwork I had commissioned for my own office and a side hustle took off.

I love it because it helps other traders/investors while keeping my mind in check.  For now, this is enough, but the market's always there to go back when I'm ready.  **To all those out there in the trenches, I implore you to take a deep look into your mind**.  If you're not at 100%, you can't expect your results to be anywhere close.  

One of the main reasons I initially wanted the art was to redecorate my own office, to see myself as a stronger trader.  **Art is powerful for the mind.**  I have a blog post on my site that you can [read here that](https://wallstreetprints.com/blogs/lessonslearned/the-benefits-of-artwork-in-a-home-or-office) takes this a step further with proven studies that show just how powerful it can be for the mind, anxiety, and even depression.

If you're not interested, not a problem.  Just take a look inside and make sure you're 100%.  There are a million people all buying the same breakout zone or trading at resistance, but the outcomes are vastly different over a few weeks to months.  There's a reason for that, and it has nothing to do with who studied the pattern better or had the better stop to survive...it's the mindset of the winning trader or investor vs the rest.

&#x200B;

So...how's your mind?",

I think the true way for most people is to put most of your money into diversified ETFs.

But if the bulk of your money is in that kind of investment then you can rest easy.  As your portfolio grows, the gains will come, and it will take little effort.

If you want to trade then use a small portion of your overall portfolio.  Treat it like a hobby.  It can be challenging and fun.  If you are stressed out then you are trading with more money than you should be.",

mashqk,,stocks,post,1616432653,"AT&T - Juiced the dividend this quarter by $0.3493Following advice on this forum I initiated a variation on the selling of covered calls on the AT&T stock I own to juice the income above what the stock earns in dividends.

&#x200B;

My strategy is when the AT&T dividends are paid into my account I buy more AT&T stock with the cash then sell covered calls against all my AT&T stock that expires the week before earnings.

&#x200B;

Doing this on 2/1 I was able to buy more AT&T shares at $28.79 and sell ""T Apr 16 2021 CALL 31.0"" for $0.49 which is near what the dividend is. If the stock would have been called at $31 I would have made $2.21 a share gain and pocketed the $0.49 for the call.

&#x200B;

As of today with the earnings call happening on 4/22, the dividend date announcement happening soon and the ex-dividend date in early April I decided to close my covered calls at $0.11.

&#x200B;

I netted $3423.56 in gains on the covered call options or $0.3493 per share.

&#x200B;

Adding the $0.52 dividend to the $0.3493 will give me 0.8693 of income for my 9800 shares of AT&T this quarter which is a 3% return or 12% annually.

max8nb,,stocks,post,1616445163,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 22, 2021Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

From Yahoo. March 2nd - Sweden-based Havre Global said Feb. 24 that it will list its stock. Investors waiting on the sidelines for further IPO details and confirmation of the true market size for milk substitutes may have had their questions answered.

Starbucks confirmed Monday that all of its stores nationwide will offer guests the option of adding Oatly's non-dairy milk substitute product as of Tuesday. The oat-based milk can be included in all of Starbucks' spring menu options.

Oatly's IPO details will likely be presented to the public in the coming weeks. The company could be seeking a $10-billion valuation in an eventual listing.
————————————————————————
Also:

 PRNewsWire included Oatly among its top oat milk brands, with other competitors in the market being Happy Planet Foods Inc., Danone (Silk), and Earth’s Own Food Company. In 2019, the global oat milk market size was $360.5 million. By 2027, that figure is projected to grow to $995.3 million. 

 One reason for oat milk’s increase in popularity is that it is often fortified with calcium and vitamin D, helping create a balanced diet for vegans and those with lactose intolerance. A greater acceptance of vegan lifestyles is also a factor. Oat-based dairy replacements have also grown in popularity because data suggest they have a lower environmental impact than some other plant-based milks, such as almond and cashew milk.",['SBUX']

I'm a new passive investor who buys only ETFs.
So what I know about current market situation is that bond yield is increasing which is bad for the market because that would mean investors will be more interested in buying bonds as it's safer.
My question is has the yield already increased or things are still in process?
Does this change your guys decision to buy stocks right now? I know timing the market doesn't work but I saw comments on this sub saying that they're refraining from buying growth stocks until the there's more news about bond yield.

The problem is that a ton of people are leveraged into speculative plays that are not profitable (which is why there is a bunch of negative sentiment). These companies have to borrow money in the debt market to continue operating - they do this through corporate bond offerings (or share dilution in the equity market), this comes with the promise that the company will pay their creditors back in a few years at a certain APR. If interest rates in the medium/long-term go up, then it becomes more difficult for these companies to grow, since they’ll have to pay more of their income in interest payments, rather than continued growth. They can avoid this by writing shorter dated bonds, but they’ll have to be able to repay the entirety of the loan sooner, rather than later, which has it’s own slew of issues.

The bond yields also affect a lot more than just what companies can borrow money it, it also affects - student loans, mortgages, savings accounts, margin loans, basically any loan you can get in the US.",

The bond market is dynamic, in the long run, the yield will obviously rise. In the short run though, the yield may experience a pullback and this may trigger another tech run.

You see, fed signaled no rate increase til 2024, even with our fast economic recovery. But the bond vililantes (yes that's an actual term, go look it up) protested by selling bonds and FORCED the yield to rise. They protested because when economy recovers, you are supposed to signal increase in rates (Econ 101). But fed didn't do that. However, as the yield rise, many bonds investors, such as the Japanese gov, will jump in and buy the bonds, which will lower the yield. 

Fed can also jump in and buy bonds but it may not work because in order to buy bonds they have to print even more money, which is obviously inflationary (ie, fed losing control of the bond market). Nasty stuff.

mb8wv8,grwm7nj,stocks,comment,1616485382,"Inflation doesn’t occur simultaneously and instantly. For example, every year, let’s say inflation is 2%. Apple is not raising its iPhone price 2% every year. Sometimes they raise by more, sometimes not at all. People expect the 2% inflation raise yearly. If all the sudden were on pace for 4%, but Apple has already released their phones and isn’t going to randomly raise prices mid cycle, they are now making 2% less than expected (4% actual minus 2% expected). 

In a nutshell, inflation causes the value of money to go down right? so when inflation occurs, if a company is bringing in the same nominal dollar amount but inflation is rising (and outpacing expectations that have been accounted for) the “real” or “true” revenue is less than expected. 

Inflation lowers future real earnings. 

To counter this, the fed raises interests rates, but doing so means it costs more money for companies to borrow money. For a tech company that may not be as profitable now but expects to be in the future so they rely on loans (think Uber, Doordash, lots of EV companies and SPACs), rising interests rates means needing to make more money to pay off debt. 

So inflation bad but so is the solution to inflation. 

To take advantage, a lot of people are rotating into value stocks (tech stocks are hit the hardest by inflation/raising interest rate) since these companies rely less on loans. Further consumer staples and retailers like Walmart etc continue to do well since interest rates rising isn’t that bad for them + inflation isn’t as much as a factor since they sell goods (like bread, eggs) that can fluctuate with the economy.

Personally, I think tech stocks will see a nice little run now that the fed has committed to not raising rates till 2023 and we’ve already had our big scare.

maqgm6,,stocks,post,1616427446,"The Telehealth Underdog: AMWL Announcing Q4 Earnings This WeekIt’s the season for Q4 earnings announcements. One that I haven’t heard much hype about yet is Amwell, which is weird to me because it’s one of the country’s largest telehealth companies. I’ve had my eye on AMWL since it’s IPO in September of 2020. The stock debuted at $18, where it issued 41.2 million shares and raised $742 million. It’s had a 52-week high of $43. So, like most stocks in recent weeks, it’s dipped a bit as COVID vaccines increase and the long-awaited stimulus checks hit our accounts. I don’t know about you guys, but *all* of my tickers have seen some hella red the last few weeks. Okay, maybe not GME and AMC… but that’s not what this post is about (for once). Most of us anticipate the market picking up, so here’s an overview of AMWL’s performance last quarter and what I’m expecting to see in Wednesday’s Q4 earnings call. 

AMWL’s first earnings announcement since going public came out last year in September. The company reported $62.6 million in revenue for the third quarter—an 80% increase year over year from $34.7 million. The pandemic driving millions of Americans to telehealth caused revenue to nearly double from 2019. Revenue directly from visits totalled $28.5 million, a nearly 300% increase from last year. Total visits also increased 455% from Q3 of 2019, coming in at more than 1.4 million. This is a decent chunk of the market considering the millions of Americans that have used telehealth in 2020. I know I have. Research shows that telehealth visits were up 154% the last week of March 2020 compared to the same period the previous year.

Now that the hard numbers are out of the way, here’s qualitative data that makes AMWL appealing. On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Keith Richards said he expected to see the upward trend continue for the healthcare company. This is due to a few things: A $100 million investment from Google, the expected continued use of telehealth after the pandemic ends and a plan to develop innovative technologies for the healthcare industry. Already, AMWL has launched new solutions to integrate in provider’s systems, making telehealth easier and more accessible. These include Amwell Now, Touchpoint Tablet software, and the C500 telemedicine cart. This could poise AMWL as a leader in the healthcare technology industry at the perfect time. 

So, what do the analysts think? Currently, analyst ratings show 4 buy and 7 hold. However, with AMWL hitting one of the lowest dips right now since its IPO, I’m thinking now is the best time to buy. I am in no way a financial analyst, but IMO, it can only go up from here. The stock price target shows a high of $45, median of $33, and low of $27, indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. At $20, this stock is an absolute steal. Let’s consider the potential growth here. With analysts predicting these numbers, even the median estimate represents a more than 60% increase from the current price of $20.15. At their high prediction of $45 a share, it would be more than a 120% growth in the next 12 months. Researchers say that the financial value of telemedicine visits is expected to reach $106 billion by 2023, with up to $250 billion of the current U.S. healthcare spending eventually shifting to virtual. This is why I’m talking about it, so why isn’t anyone else?

Earnings and sales forecasts predict $54.6M in sales and $-0.25 earnings per share. Now, should we be alarmed by this? Maybe in other industries, but telehealth as a whole has struggled to be profitable. Telehealth beast Teledoc hasn’t yet turned a profit either, with both companies posting a net loss in Q3 of 2020. I think this is the nature of the game. Telehealth is a relatively new and innovative industry, which sees the ups and downs anticipated from disruptive stocks. 

TLDR. Though the industry struggles to be profitable yet, telehealth is the way of the future. The pandemic may end soon, but this will not be the end of innovative healthcare technology that provides greater access to healthcare for millions of Americans. TDOC isn’t the only big player here. AMWL is the underdog we all need to be looking at before Q4 earnings are announced on Wednesday.",['UPS']

mayizi,,stocks,post,1616448682,"I think im experiencing FOMO. Can I get your guys' opinion on my thought process?Hi all!

I'm a 19 year old who has had his money in the market for around 2 years now.

Recently, as I've been finding out more and more about my passions, I've decided to major in an area in business, most likely finance or accounting. Because of this I've been learning more and more about investing and about the economy as a whole. I'm a big believer in the investing philosophies of people such as Munger, Buffet, and Lynch (but I'm also learning more about other famous investors).

One of the biggest lessons I've been discovering is that I don't know jack shit about investing and business. After reading Beating the Street by Peter Lynch, I've been thinking about my own investments and realized that I don't know near enough to support my individual stock purchases.

Last week, I made the decision to sell all my shares in all the companies I own, roughly 15,000$ on the basis that I need to learn much more before I can justify making intelligent stock purchases. I had shares in relatively riskier equities such as WFC, CCL, CHWY, and IPOE.

I think my decision to make that choice was a good idea, because the future of all these companies are pretty uncertain for one reason or another, and so I should be very well educated about the industries and business models of these companies to justify owning shares in them.

Another thing I've learned is that it's always better to invest than to let your cash sit around and do nothing. Therefore, I was considering the following investment strategy until I feel educated enough to make smart investments:

25-40% SPY

25-40% VOO

20%-50% 3-5 well known respectable blue chips stocks such as (JPM,COST,JNJ,DIS).

SPY and VOO are obviously extremely diversified and are great for less knowledgeable investors because they follow the market. Blue chip stocks are much less volatile that my previous holdings and many investors consider them safe but with positive future outlook.

Is this a decent idea? Or am I facing FOMO and wanting to have money invested to not miss out on a possible bull market in 2021? I've actually had great returns over the past year, but I know that it's easy to make money in a bull market. I don't want to be naïve and continue to invest without having strong reasoning or financial education. Thanks for reading and all input and advice will be appreciated.","['DIS', 'JPM', 'CCL', 'JNJ', 'WFC']"

How your portfolio should look like is up to you. How much risk do you want to take? If you feel you know too little to make self justified individual stock purchases, go for a global fund, or spy if you just want US exposure.

maysyv,,stocks,post,1616449463,"(NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio DD(NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio Inc DD

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders.

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley. Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1. Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth.
2. Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin.

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue.

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR.

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to.

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded.

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million.

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season.

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

Id stay away from this one personally. Wine sales were up last year due to the pandemic, Id guess they will be flat or shrink slightly for the sector this year. Wineries reopening for tasting is not really a huge factor in overall profit or revenue. 

This is at a low multiple for a reason, where is the growth going to come from? Are they acquiring other vineyards? Buying other peoples grapes? If that's the case its more than likely just for the wholesale type wines with low margin.

maxpg1,,stocks,post,1616446430,"A Bull Case DD: $NGMS NeoGames the $DKNG of iLottery 

So I've been waiting to share this DD on $NGMS until it hit a 1B market cap. Which, it did so today.

First, I know iLottery feels like such a boomer idea, but let's face it. We've all bought a powerball, played mega millions, scratched some $2 stocking stuffers at Christmas, played a little Keno at the bar, etc. This industry is essentially what the online sport gambling industry was 2-3 years ago. In my opinion this stock could make me super rich. Why, because $NGMS is the pure play here!

**Who is NeoGames ($NGMS)?**

NeoGames is a technology-driven innovator and a global provider of iLottery solutions for national and state-regulated lotteries. Their full-service solution combines proprietary technology platforms with the experience and expertise required for successful iLottery operations.

**Some DD**

iLottery in 2020 was 2.7% of the total US lottery market. In 2 quarters, Va's iLottery went from 0% to 25%. Michigan's iLottery market share has grown to 40% of total lottery sales. In Europe, iLottery is 25-50+% of the total lottery market depending on the country. In 10 years, when the total U.S. lottery market is 120B, iLottery could be 50% assuming all states are online. $NGMS is in a joint venture with Pollard Banknote under the name of NPI (Pollard is a big player in the lottery printing business). NPI's cut of ilottery is 15%. Neo's cut is 7.5%. 7.5% of 60B is 4.5B. Profit margin is roughly 40%, or 1.8B and $70/sh. Put a 15X multiple on it, and you have a $1,000 stock. It currently trades at around $40/sh today at a 1B cap. And iLottery could reach 50% sooner than 10 years if Va's experience is any indication.

$NGMS is currently contracted with 50% of the states that allow iLottery; and has 70% of the market share (total $).

Just wait until CA, NY, FL, and TX join the party. NY just legalized online sports gambling, and unless they want to lose market share, they'll put the lottery online, too. Online sports gambling provides a MUCH lesser cut for the government. Lottery is a HUGE revenue driver for state governments, so they will not sit idle on iLottery for long once online sports gambling is legal.

Here is the kicker. $NGMS is also teasing getting into online sports gambling. My valuation on them is purely based on iLottery potential. If they were to get into sports gambling, look out... their technology is incredible and they could add a some serious disruption to that market as well. They are also an international business... I only included the upside from the US market alone. They have also gained contracts with entire European countries in recent weeks.

Do your own DD I am an idiot. Good Luck to all.",

mb3y4s,,stocks,post,1616464964,"Tesla (TSLA) could be worth $2.9 Trillion USD by 2025. The Next Tesla? At least $1.1 Trillion USD. (More DD Valuation Re. VOW and VWAGY)Today, ARK's Cathie Wood declared that Tesla could be worth $2.9 trillion USD by 2025, when setting a $3,000 price target.

What about the Next Tesla?

Thanks to guidance from Deutsche Bank, the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, should be worth at least $1.1 trillion USD, or over €0.9 trillion, by 2025.

[As of yesterday, Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should have been worth €181.2 billion.  Its consumer EV business proper should have been worth between €195.0 billion to €479.1 billion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ma2gyz/dd_valuation_of_the_next_tesla_grossly/)

So, how does the grossly undervalued Volkswagen get to €0.9 trillion by 2025?

The easier part is achieving and maintaining a valuation of €181.2 billion for its ICE and hybrid business.

As for the more ambitious part, management released this Investor Presentation:

[Leading the Transformation](https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/publications/presentations/2021/03/2021-03-16_Deep_Dive_Dahlheim.pdf)

Its 231,600 consumer EVs sold in 2020 constituted approximately 3% of its sales mix.  This achievement surpassed management estimates.

Next year, the company intends to increase this by at least two-fold, such that the sales mix is 6%.  Expect anywhere between 463,200 and 500,000 EVs.  [Deutsche Bank's conservative valuation of €195.0 billion for the consumer EV business today](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/) is surely based on lower numbers.

By 2025, the company intends to achieve a consumer EV sales mix of approximately 20%.  Expect approximately 1,544,000 EVs, or between 1.5 million and 1.6 million EVs.

Without taking into account inflation, consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €36.98 billion.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Even Deutsche Bank has conceded this distinguished multiple for the likes of Nio, despite that pure play EV maker having lower gross margin percentages than Tesla.  **Therefore, the consumer EV business should be worth at least €739.7 billion by 2025.**

All this is how the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, can reach a value of at least €920.9 billion, or over $1.1 trillion USD, by 2025.

I am bullish on the Score and hold 33 shares at a 32.59 CAD AVG. I intend on adding more once my swings either pay me out or inevitably hit my stop loss. I am not even remotely close to a financial advisor, I just started trading recently, so it is not a wise idea to buy or sell anything because of me.

Ticker:SCR

Marketcap:1.3bil USD

Shares outstanding:50 mil The Float:28mil

AVG Volume:330,000

All numbers from FINVIZ

CEO:John Levy 

Also the SCR just wen through an aggressive 10 to 1 r/S to get listed on the NASDAQ so institutional investors would take them seriously, which can explain why some of your charts may look funky. The r/S initially had the $SCR jump up to 54 CAD but then went down to like 26 CAD, now it seems to be consolidating in the low 30s.

The Bull Case

TheScore media is a Canadian based media company which is looking to get into the online gambling industry. The Score is the third biggest sports app in North America and biggest in Canada. The familiarity with the brand should be massive in Canada, and some experts have predicted Ontario itself to have 2-3 billion in annual revenue from sports betting (probably thanks to the Leafs sucking ass when it counts). Online gambling has been a craze with legalization becoming more imminent, and governments wanting to rake in that extra tax revenue.

Canada has just recently passed bill C-218, which aims to legalizes all single game sports betting. There is another reading tomorrow, where John Levy will be present to speak. Trudeau and his liberals also seems super pumped about passing this bill, as it can be a way to pay back CERB and other covid related debts.

PENN owns a 4.1% stake in the SCR and there have been buyout rumours from DKNG. Both want the brand that the Score owns. TheScore also has a partnership with PENN, where theScore bet app can be in states that PENN is in, as theScore is currently operating in Colorado, Iowa, Indiana and, New Jersey. As other states are set to legalize, theScore is hoping to get a piece of the American pie. Canada it will be much less complicated to operate.

PENN's market cap is 16.89 billion and Draftkings (DKNG) is 26.79 billion. Although I do not think $SCR will reach that anytime soon, it demonstrates the room for improvement.

SCR also just closed the 186 million IPO in the USA. They have lots of cash to throw at ads and others things a sports books will need.

They are also doing aggressive promos, like a $500 first bet risk-free. I have not used the app as I am Canadian and it is not available yet, but looking at videos and pictures, it looks clean. [https://www.thescore.bet](https://www.thescore.bet/)

Macquarie today initiated coverage on $SCR with an outperform rating and a $44 price target, and they are known for giving pretty conservative ratings. It is exciting that the score is getting the attention it deserves.

My PT is $70ish EOY and $150ish by 2025, but I also pulled these numbers out of my ass so don't base anything off of them.

BEARISH CASE

I am afraid of off-shore sports books already taking away a lot of the revenue of people who are already betting. Before I got into investing I used to bet with Betway and was confused why my money was being converted into pounds and it was always advertising soccer. I didn't realize what I was doing was illegal and many others don't. Also I don't think a ton of people would change apps unless the government tried to ban them or something. I am not very knowledgeable in the offshore sports books world.

Also DKNG and PENN are such monsters that they could just smother us with there promos and ads.

TLDR:$SCR is a media company which is turning to online gambling for sports. There is a lot of room for improvement. IANAFA. Do your own DD.

Any feedback on my first DD would be greatly appreciated. I know this isn't super complex with TA or financials, as I am still learning.",['NDAQ']

I've been posting these every week over in [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) which some people actually enjoy so I thought this would be beneficial here for some of you. I'm SUPER LATE compared to when I usually post this, but below you'll find the watchlist notes for potential plays this week!

I usually do a livestream every Sunday and do the charting so people can watch and learn, but I couldn't do it yesterday. However, I had the Discord members send me their tickers so that I could chart them when I had time. Below is my technical analysis with targets for what they sent me. If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing).

Last week was rough for everyone (although I'm sure everyone will agree that the Powell pump on Wed was AMAZING) so I hope this week is a lot better for you!

\-Davin

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 6 // Targets Hit = 2 // Success Rate: 33%**

**$RIDE**\----No targets hit. Held the support we identified, but couldn’t fill the gap up to $18. Slowly bled off the rest of the week down to a low of $12.60

**$AQB**\----first target hit on Monday. It was $0.01 away from reaching our second target. Been choppy all week, but still holding above support line that it was resting on the prior Friday during AH

**$UBER**\----no targets hit. Highest it reached was $61.02 on Tuesday, but that was still $0.28 away from our first target. Fell all throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, stayed above 200 EMA on 4hr chart from Wednesday to Friday. Now back above 23.6% fib level so could be a potential play heading into this new week

**$AM**\----no targets hit. Uptrend support didn’t hold and slowly trended down throughout the week.

**$PLTR**\----no targets hit. First target was missed by $0.28 which was during premarket on Monday. PLTR took a doodoo throughout the rest of the week and hit a low of $23.39

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*** \- denotes the plays from the members that I really like and will be watching as well

**$FUBO:** seems to be holding support along the 61.8% fib level which is plotted as $29.55. If that holds and volume comes through we could see a gap fill up to $35.77. It’s holding support really well AND showing low volume the past two weeks, which is great to see if you’re wanting to go long because it shows strength even with decreased trading.

PT if $29.55 holds: $33 (conservative) > high $35’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*$SPCE:** Looking at the daily chart, I’m thinking it’ll fall down instead of head up, but we’ll have to see what happens during PM and Monday. If it can reclaim the downtrend resistance as support, then we can focus on the resistances as our targets. But, I’ll focus on the downside for now with how the chart is looking unless something shows me otherwise.

PT: $30 (low of prior trading day candles) > $28 (200 ema) > $24 (0% fib level from drawing on downtrend)

&#x200B;

**$TME:** Has earnings coming up later this morning, which is likely why it had a small run the past three trading days. Looks to have made new highs, so it’s a bit risky getting in now. I personally hate trading things when it’s at new highs until it starts consolidating and making new levels, but that’s not to say there’s no money to be made. I drew a fib extension to see what we’re dealing with and it looks like it already made it to the 100% extension level and is holding it as support on the 4hr. Hard to make a prediction where this could go ahead of earnings as I haven’t done any DD on the company, but I’ll give targets shown with the support/resistance levels below.

PT (upside): low $31’s > high $32’s

PT (downside): $30 > $29 > mid $28’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*NFLX:** Pretty much trading sideways the past two weeks. Hopefully that changes this week since the earnings report is coming up in about a month. Need to watch and wait to see if it breaks out of the consolidation it’s doing right now. More importantly, it needs to get above that $511 level and hold it as support to push up. If it fails that, we could see it drop towards the 200 EMA and uptrend support line, but I’m leaning more towards the upside due to earnings.

PT (upside): $516 > $530 > $542

&#x200B;

**\*\*$AMD:** Great looking chart as far as a buying opportunity goes. It’s near the key support level ($73.71) of the consolidation channel it’s been in since July of last year. Price is sitting on top of the 200 EMA on the daily chart as support, but if that gives we could see it falling to the uptrend support/key support in consolidation channel at what point I’d definitely want to take a position either shares or options a few weeks to a few months away.

PT (upside): high $81’s > high $84’s > $87 > $89

PT (downside): high $77’s > high $75’s > $74

&#x200B;

**\*\*$RBLX:** Bounced off the support at $67.17 and now trading real tight along the 200 EMA on the 4hr. Will need more trading time to see which way we’re heading because we’re also trading within a symmetrical triangle. Could break up towards resistance (which I’m leaning toward the most) or down towards support at which point I’d pay attention for a bounce.

PT (upside): $72 > $76

&#x200B;

**$AAPL:** Will be paying attention to this as we have a current call option in play, but looks to be heading up from support (both the uptrend and downtrend) which is great!

PT: mid $121’s > mid $122’s > $124 > $125

&#x200B;

**$SBBP:** Currently charting this as PM opened up and it took the hell off (LOL). If it holds this level at $4.63 we could see a gap fill to the high of PM of $5.46.

PT (upside): $5.46 > $6.33 > $6.82 > $7.00

&#x200B;

Pro: poor situation in Europe will increase demand for the bonds, lowering yield

Con: removal of bank SLR rule will lower banks interest in purchasing bonds, lowering demand from banks, increasing yield

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on what will happen? Article from the street:

&#x200B;

U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower Monday, providing early support for tech stocks that could extend throughout the week as the government looks to unload nearly $330 billion in new debt onto a cautious and unsteady bond market.

&#x200B;

Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the country's central bank chief, Naci Agba, over the weekend, just days after he had approved an 200 basis point interest rate hike designed to blunt the impact of inflation in the struggling economy. 

&#x200B;

""The new political interference from Erdogan, who has long railed against hiking interest rates because he thinks they cause inflation, send the lira into a tailspin on fears that international investors will pull their money from the country on concerns of new rate cuts the would undermine the orthodox “'bitter medicine' of further interest rate hikes to stabilize and strengthen the currency,"" said Saxo Bank strategists. ""The country is already low on reserves and could, in extremis have to implement capital controls if capital flight, whether domestic or foreign, becomes a deepening problem.""

&#x200B;

The move sent the Turkish lira down 15% against the U.S. dollar, the steepest decline in nearly three years, and triggered a rush to safe-have assets in Europe and elsewhere, including U.S. Treasury bonds, with benchmark 10-year notes falling to 1.68% from the 1.75% peak, the highest since January 2020, they reached during the height of last -week's sell off.

&#x200B;

Ironically, much of what Governor Agba said with respect to rate hikes -- which he linked to shift in global investor appetite, loose central bank policies around the world, rising commodity prices and near-term inflation risks -- are concerns that have triggered the longest rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields in eight years and corresponding pullback in tech and growth stocks.

&#x200B;

Further upward pressure followed last week when the Federal Reserve, fresh off its March policy meeting that pledge to keep rates at record lows for at least the next two years -- even as the economy looks set to grow at its fastest pace since 1984 -- ended a capital break for domestic banks that could lead to further Treasury bond sales, and thus higher yields, in the months ahead.

&#x200B;

Normally, that would have investors exceedingly nervous heading into a hectic week of bond auctions, which includes a $60 billion sale of benchmark 2-year notes on Tuesday and another $62 billion in 7-year notes on Thursday, as inflation signals hot up and deficit hawks renew their criticisms of the Biden Administration's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Act.

&#x200B;

Turkey's brewing currency crisis, however, alongside the sputtering vaccine rollout efforts in Europe that are likely to delay the region's post-pandemic re-opening, are likely to boost demand from international investors for the U.S. assets on sale this week, keeping prices high and borrowing costs low.

&#x200B;

A $38 billion sale of benchmark 10-year notes earlier this month, in fact, drew solid international demand, with foreign investors taking up 57% of the overall total. 

&#x200B;

That said, analysts at JPMorgan caution that the Fed's removal of the SLR benefit, just as primary dealers are likely needed to take-up a greater share of the $209 billion in coupon paper on sale this week, could lead to another leg higher in Treasury yields -- and corresponding pressures on U.S. stocks -- in the days ahead.

&#x200B;

""While valuations are supportive of increased demand from foreign investors ... foreign demand alone is unlikely to stabilize Treasury yields,"" JPMorgan said. ""Moreover, over the very near term, liquidity conditions lend upside risk to yields ahead of (this) week’s supply process.""",['LEG']

(NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI), more details have emerged.

What Happened: Nio is availing the services of Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley for assisting with its Hong Kong listing, an IFR report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Nio is reportedly looking to offload a 5% stake, valued at around $3.4 billion, in a secondary listing.

The valuation is calculated based on Friday's closing price of Nio's ADS listed on the NYSE.

matr63,,stocks,post,1616435925,"I’m planning on opening a 529 for my nephew named after me. What strategies I should consider?My nephew is 1 at the moment, so there is an abundant amount of time for a 529 to mature by the time he reaches college age.

I’m wondering what some low to moderate risk strategies may be. I feel like a goal of 100k is achievable.

Should I set a 75/25 stocks to bonds for instance? What ETFs should I consider?

I’d also like it to be a set and mostly forget sort of strategy with minimal trading.

Thanks!",
matr63,gru553p,stocks,comment,1616436180,I’d just buy 100% VOO for set and forget tbh,
matr63,grv08pr,stocks,comment,1616450390,"I would shy away from a 529 and just use a generic brokerage account and then pay it out to him when he turns of age on a semester to semester basis. The reasons why are:

It varies state to state on what the rules are for 529’s. Some states allow you to take tax deductions for the contributions you make. If your state offers no tax deduction, I would definitely not use a 529. There are no federal tax deductions currently for contributing to 529’s. 

Additionally, some state sponsored plans allow you to use the money at whatever college you choose, even out of state colleges, which is nice, but other prepaid plans do not. I would not use a prepaid 529 because of this.

There are penalties if you do not use the funds for education expenses (10% + ordinary income tax rate) unless the beneficiary received a scholarship. If that were the case, you can take out the scholarship amount.

You may be subject to gift tax if you deposit more than the gift amount allowed in a single year, which is currently $15k.

If you invest too much into the 529 plan it’s theoretically locked up and will be subject to the penalty (10%) plus ordinary income tax rate to withdrawal.

The major reason though is you don’t know the future cost of college or if it will be free one day. Although I don’t agree with it, a lot of politicians are pushing for free college.

Also, with a brokerage account you can use margin funds to leverage yourself to have even more returns. I don’t believe you can do any margining with a 529 plan.

*Opinions are my own and shall not be taken as financial advice.",
matr63,gruhujj,stocks,comment,1616441867,"Just put it in a separate account screw the 529 what happens if they decide they don’t want to go to college, you could use it for a house down payment or something else instead, maybe they want to start a business. Or maybe they grow up and turn into a total A-hole you can just keep your money. Lol  I have a couple 529 for my kids but quickly stopped funding them and changed to just setting up custodial accounts for them instead. Sure I don’t get the tax savings but I’m not limited to what they can spend it on personally I hope they save it so they have a big jump on a retirement fund.  Not advice, good luck either way sounds like a lucky nephew",

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-22.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq futures rise as 10-year Treasury yield retreats

> * The Nasdaq on Monday was set to build on Friday’s nearly 0.8% increase as the 10-year Treasury yield started the new week retreating from last week’s 14-month high. The rapid rise in Treasury yields this year have been pressuring growth stocks, many of them tech names, tech stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, which lost ground Friday, joined the Nasdaq in negative territory for the week. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs Wednesday, while the Nasdaq last closed at a record in February.

*****

> # 2. AstraZeneca vaccine found to be 79% effective in U.S. trial

> * AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness, according to data published Monday from a 32,000-plus person Phase 3 trial in the U.S. The two-shot vaccine also showed a 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. AstraZeneca plans to file with the FDA for emergency use authorization in April. The U.S. trial data comes as a number of European nations temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. AstraZeneca said in a release Monday that an independent board identified no safety concerns related to its inoculation.

*****

> # 3. Covid cases are rising in 21 states as governors relax restrictions

> * Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates in the U.S., Covid cases are increasing in 21 states and highly infectious variants are spreading as governors relax restrictions on businesses. Public health officials warn that while roughly 2.5 million people around the country are receiving shots every day, infection levels have plateaued this month. Nationwide, new infections are holding around 54,000 on average in the past seven days. That’s a dramatic drop from January’s peak. While deaths are much lower as well, an average of 1,000 people were still dying from Covid each day over the past seven days.

*****

> # 4. Canadian Pacific Railway to buy Kansas City Southern

> * Canadian Pacific Railway has agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The combination would create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Following Sunday’s announcement, shares of Kansas City Southern rose about 17% in the premarket, while shares of Canadian Pacific Railway dropped about 2.5%. The deal comes as hopes that U.S.-Mexico trade will pick up now that Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as U.S. president.

*****

> # 5. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sees Tesla reaching $3,000 per share by 2025

> * Shares of Tesla rose 4% in Monday’s premarket after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made a long-awaited, bold call, projecting the Elon Musk-led electric auto maker would more than quadruple by 2025. Last year, Ark Invest estimated Tesla would hit $1,400 adjusted for its five-for-one stock split by 2024. The firm now sees the stock reaching $3,000 per share by 2025 in its base case, and reaching $4,000 per share in its bull case. Wood’s bear case still sees hit hitting $1,500 by 2025. Tesla, which closed at $654 per share Friday, soared 665% in the past 12 months. However, the stock over the past month and year-to-date hit a rough patch.

mamqll,grt0ea5,stocks,comment,1616417519,Did Cathie lick her finger and hold it in the air prior to that prediction? Feels like a dubiously round number way too far out for anyone to remember later. Is this just a sad attempt at market manipulation? I like ARK (particularly F) but come on...,
mamqll,gru007w,stocks,comment,1616433941,And the market again drops hot around 10am and stocks go on sale.. dammit. I saw green in the premarket so I avoided.,
matflz,,stocks,post,1616435082,"Is there value in only buying a few shares of a stock?I keep finding new companies to invest in but sometimes only buy 1-5 shares, which ultimately  might not amount to a large increase in money over the course of 5+ years (assuming it goes up at all).

For example, I bought one share of chewy for $80 cause I like the company and I think they have a nice future. I don’t necessarily think the stock will reach $500, but I feel confident of it hitting $160 someday. So only a profit of $80 over the course of a few years. 

Another example, I bought 2 shares in Costco at $330. I don’t think it’ll “go to the moon” but maybe it’ll reach 400. Again, not a lot of money to ultimately cash out on someday. 

I’ve taken this approach with 15+ stocks I want to hold because I think they’ll do well but I don’t necessarily want to drop thousands of dollars in each. So far I’ve invested about 40k.

TLDR: is there value in only buying a few shares of the average performing stock? Or do I need to up my percentage? For arguments sake let’s ignore using the extremely rare Amazon or apple example that someone bought for $5 and it has turned them into a millionaire) I’m talking about the average performing stock.","['AMZN', 'AAPL']"

If you had 1k then yeah buying a share here or a share there is what you could afford to do. 40k I would probably at least stick to 500-1000$ investments, but thats just me. The expensive shares are a little different. Like I have 3 shares of GOOGL...I can't afford 40 shares...so I have 3 because thats still a decent percentage of the money I use for individual shares (the bulk of my investments are in funds). 330 for costco I could see only having a couple shares with 40k to invest.",['GOOGL']

maxqjl,,stocks,post,1616446514,"New, Stupid, and Trying to make Sense of EverythingSo I got a major income hike last year and decided to celebrate my first paycheck at the new salary with a baby investment of $200. That was around September. I'm sitting at $325 now, so I feel like for being a noob with no idea what I'm doing that I have been doing pretty okay so far. I've just been running off what seems like common sense so far, but I want to actually know what I am doing a little better.

It's rough though. I don't want to trust major websites because they lie about so much else. I've started lurking some of the stock related subs here, but everything is so loaded with jargon no one explains that it feels like I'm trying to read a foreign language. Even the rare 'beginners' post I manage to come across every blue moon is nigh incomprehensible.

I don't want to invest any more than I have in stocks now until I'm more knowledgeable. The initial $200 was a crazy whim that's been working so far, but a gamble is a gamble and you don't play big if you don't know the strategies inside and out. At this point even a general overview of those is an improvement over the common sense ""sell high, buy low, diversify"" I came in with.

Can anyone point me in the right direction for trustworthy info given in layman's terms? Is there a lexicon or something with the definitions for all the acronyms and terminology someone can link me to? Should I just take my gains thus far and back out until I actually know what I'm doing?",

mb4edg,,stocks,post,1616466425,"Thoughts on European telecom diversification plays.So this is going to serve as a bit of DD and Discussion but I’m wanting to hear others opinions on these companies and hear what y’all’s outlooks are on them vs mine. 

So first up is Vodafone Group PLC (VOD); a company that pays semiannual dividends with a 5.7% yield, a current price around $18.65, a PT between $22.60-$25.48, an average PT of $24.04 and a P/B ratio of only .76. Looking at these numbers alone it seems like VOD is undervalued and when you look at their expansion into Africa and India as well as cementing their status as Europe’s discount cell service for all backpackers/tourists/Americans stationed overseas (they actually have contracts with the US military to sell their phones and chips directly to Americans on base in the military’s PX’s and BX’s)/students studying abroad you can see how qualitatively they also have a lot going for them. Personally I’m looking to begin dollar cost averaging in to VOD as I find both their yield and growth prospects attractive. Not to mention I used them while I was living in Germany and so did every single kid in my school. 

The second company I would like to discuss with y’all is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE) or for those of us in the states (DTEGY). DTEGY pays only a yearly dividend with a 3.47% yield and trades around $19.65 with a PT range between $15.53-$29.82, an average TP of $23.85 and a much more average P/B ratio of 2.16. While these numbers aren’t as great as VOD it is still the largest telecommunication provider in all of Europe, and also owns like 45% of T-mobile so they are getting a large amount of revenue from America’s 3rd largest cellular network. While I haven’t found anything on them expanding into emerging markets I have seen their recent huge investments into 5G and how they are making moves to solidify their 5G network to maintain their largest in Europe status. 

So do y’all have any thoughts on VOD and DTEGY? Personally I’m going to be buying a few shares of both and just watch how 5G continues to roll out. I also like them as they offer me some international exposure and diversification. Personally I hate AT&T due to dealing with them for years as a customer and as such don’t want to invest in them but still want some more communication sector diversification outside of VZ and DIS that still pays a decent dividend.

Margin requirement is the proportion of the security value that can be purchased and/or must be maintained over time using your own margin equity (meaning cash or security value). If you have $1000 in cash, then you can purchase up to $1250 of an 80% margin requirement ETF. $1000 (80% of $1250) of it is purchased with your funds and $250 on a margin loan.

mamzv4,,stocks,post,1616418045,"Is the double bottom a bullish sign because it signals the short sellers have covered?APT and VSQTF ([VST.C](https://VST.CA)N) are very different stocks that are in the very same situation.

APT has been profitable for a long time. VST became profitable last year.

APT has a lot of cash from selling covid masks. VST has a lot of cash from selling covid tests.

Both have share buyback programs.

Both are regular targets for short sellers.

Both were being shorted in the recent downturn.

Both thought good news would protect their shareholders from the dramatic drop in price. Both were wrong.

It appears that the short sellers took the price below the price point the companies wanted to maintain. The companies then started buying back their stock and raised the price, possibly to where the short sellers aren't profitable.

Is it possible the short sellers didn't have time to cover? Is that why the double bottom happens?

If so, both companies are limited to the number of shares they can repurchase in a month. That would mean the short sellers will win. It also means we have a hint as to the short sellers' target prices.

Add in FANFF ([FANS.CN](https://FANS.CN)) . This is a portfolio company of VST so VST has an interest in protecting the share price. FANS also looks like it's headed to a double bottom.

This DD will be dedicated to the long term growth potential of AMC and why I believe it is undervalued. As I was writing this, a lot has happened as such I will going through the mathematics and speculative valuation as well as in my opinion suspicious price action, as relevant to the long term potential of AMC currently; as well as try to reassure investors by clearing up a lot of the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) regarding the stock moving forward. All of this is my opinion, and my opinion alone of course, and not financial advice.

With that being stated; lets dive in:

This DD will be composed of the following sections:

i) Fundamentals

ii) Sentiment

iii) Momentum

iv) Consolidation

v) Future potential

vi) Bonus section: Connection to the Short Squeeze

\----FUNDAMENTALS----

So, let's begin with AMC's history:

AMC is a 100 year old company that is deeply embedded into American culture. Entertainment, movies and outings with friends and family has always been a top priority for people (globally). Making an investment into the nations largest theater chain is a bullish and potentially a highly profitable investment. Founded in the 1920s, out of Kansas, AMC offered its first IPO in the 80s which kick-started its growth to become Americas largest theater chain to this day. The price for AMC began to become undervalued in 2012, and as such sensing an opportunity Wanda ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Group)) bought a majority stake in AMC, making Wanda the largest theater chain in the world. As such, AMC became a very stable company with a natural bullish outlook with major blue chip investors having large stakes in the company. Furthermore in 2016, Adam Aron was appointed the CEO in January and by May made moves to successfully acquire AMC's largest competitor Carmike Cinemas, successfully integrating it into the company and thereby cementing it at America's largest theater chain. In September of 2018, Silver Lakes Investments made a 600 mill investment into AMC, buying back approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class B common stock. Wanda continues to this day to hold the majority on the board of directors though. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC\_Theatres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres))

In October of 2019 AMC began its streaming service to compete with Netflix and co by starting to rent out films and even offering digital purchases via AMC Theatres On Demand. Just shortly after the premiere rumors of a new virus began to circulate in Wuhan in late November. The plague then hit America during February with the first cases, and by March the country was shut down and AMC had 0 in income coming from all theaters. Despite their core business grinding to a halt AMC raised almost over 2.2 billion dollars to my knowledge to date to stave off bankruptcy, as confirmed by the CEO ([http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC)).

Additional sources, documenting cash raising throughout the year are given below:

([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html),

[https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/](https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/),

[https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/))

AMC has completely avoided bankruptcy which should conclude its all-time low share price phase. Furthermore, it must be noted the CEO Adam Aron, has been quite skilled at handling crisis after crisis for AMC, whether its keeping AMC relevant despite pressure from streaming services or surviving a pandemic. The current CEO is a big part of why I believe AMC has immense growth potential. In addition to that the potential revenue from postponed blockbuster like Top Gun Maverick or Marvel movie releases from the beginning of 2020 up until now offers great potential for a post-covid recovery play. Even now relatively small releases such as Tom and Jerry see theatres filled to the legal capacity.

Due to my findings, I believe AMC has rock solid fundamentals of being profitable in addition to a time tested historical track record of being at minimum self sustaining regardless of negative historical events. Like America, it can bounce back from multiple crises better than before.

At the time of writing, AMC has become a favorite of the average retail investor and the wallstreetbets ""movement"", as such the buying pressure on AMC is quite high; this can be seen from AMCs buy to sell ratio, which sits right now at 92:8. It usually fluctuates from 98:2 to 90:10 at any given time, depending on the volatility of the stock ([https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price](https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price)). Over the past two months, AMC shareholders refused to sell despite high volatility, which usually indicates strong belief in the fundamentals. Furthermore, institutional ownership has been skyrocketing with the quarterly inflow of this year being 98M compared to 1.51M in outflow ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)).

Current public sentiment is that AMC is a sure-fire hit, just waiting for launch on both retail and institutional side with Vanguard and BlackRock being the most prominent recent investors. As traditional long-term investors, both companies likely believe that the stock is undervalued, making it an excellent time to take a stake for long-term value increase. ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the\_institutional\_investors\_in\_both\_gme\_and\_amc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the_institutional_investors_in_both_gme_and_amc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)).

The compounding effect of higher and higher prices contributes to the bullish sentiment supported by brokerages like fidelity which predict AMC could go up to 1.1k by September ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)). The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

\-----MOMENTUM-----

The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

Furthermore if we look at AMC's competition like Cinemark [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/)), and Marcus ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/)), both of which are smaller companies by both market cap and market share, have a higher share price even if you account for the total amount of outstanding shares; thus indicating higher growth potential for AMC increasing the bullish momentum we've already seen.

As such to end this section off, I believe have proven that AMC's current share price is undervalued and if the projections of fidelity are to believed and the predicted share price is 1.1k+ with the current momentum and buying power ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)), this stock is heavily undervalued, which has been reflected in the recent price action. I believe will continue to rise until the free market finds the correct price again, continuing the bullish momentum.

\-----CONSOLIDATION-----

I'd argue the most important part of a stocks price movement is consolidation. The price consolidation of a stock is defined by the share price effectively finding support at a price point, where in which the price of the stock doesn't easily fall under for a certain period of time. The longer the floor lasts, the stronger the consolidation is generally speaking. In contrast a quick consolidation may indicate a bull run with the price dropping back down afterwards. Quick is of course relative to the volatility of the stock in question, with AMC being one of the most volatile of stocks over the last couple of months a steady increase in share price over the last couple of months could be considered a slow consolidation.

As the definition for consolidation has been established now, lets apply it to the price action for AMC. Using the last 3 sections of fundamentals, momentum and sentiment we can establish that AMC is currently looking for it's ""fair value"" on the stock market. The more consolidation occurs at higher and higher prices, the quicker the share price will rise and find new floors, as the free market tries to find the price for the stock and in my personal opinion it's not stopping anytime soon.

Furthermore, as more retail investors buy the stock, price volatility and volume will increase. With higher volume comes price consolidation which in turn increases the stock price over time. This increasing level of support also directly affects options as more options will expire in the money with each new price consolidation floor. With this additional buying pressure comes volatility that drives the price up, causing more options to expire in the money, shooting the price to new heights. This process will repeat in a positive feedback loop, until the free market/shareholders determines the price of the stock to be fairly valued.

Several companies experienced the same phenomenon like Tesla, Volkswagen and now AMC is currently in the middle of a comparable aggressive price growth feedback cycle.

\-----FUTURE POTENTIAL-----

Now lets cover the rumors of AMC being acquired by either Amazon, or Netflix ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1), [https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain)). Lets start with Netflix:

A Netflix acquisition would be different in my opinion from Amazon. Netflix would turn into an extension of its movie network. Netflix has several storylines in development such as ""The Witcher"", ""The dark crystal: Age of resistance"", and ""the The Queen’s Gambit"" have quite high expectations; a more exhaustive list can be seen here: [https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit).

Additionally, Netflix has multiple storylines in development such as Bombay Rose, Dealer, multiple Kdrama's, Get the Goat and other storylines ([https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021), [https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix)) which will affect Netflix's market value in a positive manner.

Now, that the value of Netflix has been established, I'd like to run a thought experiment regarding the value of Netflix if it acquires AMC, and how the value of Netflix would increase and how if a retail investor (this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just a speculative case study) took a position in AMC currently at its undervalued state, how the retail investor could have the value of his/her position increase overtime in the event of a Netflix acquisition.

Netflix's valuation will increase if they had the largest American cinema chain on top of their entertainment production business. This provides a bigger platform for their entertainment to not only a larger audience, but also adding value to their existing customer base. This in turn, increases the position value of their shareholders. As such, in the case where AMC is acquired by Netflix, I believe the value of the positions in AMC/NFLX will increase. In the context of this thought experiment, as such the result of this thought experiment would be that AMC is currently undervalued in this hypothetical scenario. The value addition to AMC would handsomely reward AMC shareholders and thus would be a good investment (This is not financial advice).

Secondly, let's address the other scenario of acquisition, the Amazon deal. My understanding, many of Amazon's institutional buyers have bought into this; I'll post the source for verification: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/). As such rumors on an Amazon acquisition are not unfounded. I believe this deal will be similar to the deal with ""Whole Foods Market"" ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html)), and AMC will become a part of the Amazon ecosystem, with Amazon Prime members having value added to their existing plans. As we've seen with Whole Foods, prior to the acquisition,

Whole Foods Market was receding in a bad market position, losing market share left and right to competitors. However, after the deal with Amazon, Whole Foods Market went through a mini-financial revolution where it was able to re-acquire its original market share. This was done by Whole Foods Market getting access to 2 things Amazon brought to the table: its internet infrastructure and its customer base, as well as immense liquidity of Amazon. This allowed Whole Foods Market to quickly gain back market share; as well as innovate their business. This was done by utilizing Amazon's platforms to increase cost effectiveness. In relation to their business model they increased profits, which allowed them to expand their business, and take back market share at the expense of their competitors. Furthermore, this allowed Whole Foods Market to go from a regional distributor of organic produce to a national grocery chain specializing in organic foods.

This was done, in my opinion, by utilizing Amazon's data-centric business model. Whole Foods Market was quickly able to identify market inefficiencies and use them to gain back market share, while increasing value provided to the customer. This was accomplished through innovation and new business practices, such as faster and more centralized delivery, data intensive business planning, etc. Lastly, Whole Foods Market was able to prove there was a market place for organic fresh foods within an extremely competitive market environment by effectively using the Amazon playbook in the grocery space. In doing so, they took back their market share at the expense of profit.

I believe if AMC were to be acquired by Amazon, it would be a comparable play from there on; i.e. the gaining of market share at the expense of their competitors. They would be introducing new business methods to add value to their customers and shareholders using big data. This can be done in several ways: Amazon may utilize the Netflix model as previously proposed. This can be done by simply substituting Netflix production, development and licensed storylines model with an Amazon Prime one. Amazon Prime has original shows like ""The Expanse"" as well, as well as licensed, developing content like ""Vinland Saga"", ""Attack on Titan"" and ""The Boys"". Sources for Prime video shows are as follows:

i) [https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon](https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon)

ii) [https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked)

iii) [https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/](https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/)

Furthermore, as shown with Whole Foods Market, Amazon likes to integrate new acquisition into its ecosystem. In addition to the Netflix replacement deal, AMC customers will be offered further value that will enhance AMC's products such as family and friend bonding time as well as entertainment. This could be done in several ways, in addition to Amazon 5 star restaurants being set up within the cinemas, additional merchandizing rights, prime member discounts, centralization of merchandize and concession stands resulting in, I dare say, cheaper popcorn perhaps; the possibilities for growth are endless. As such, the Amazon scenario can, and I believe, have as much growth potential as the Netflix scenario.

The third scenario; is AMC rebuilding itself to compete with streaming services and offer a better service to its customers. This is also another profitable scenario. Right now AMC is the largest cinema chain in the country; with multiple accredited investors like BlackRock and Vanguard. Furthermore, they have 2.2 Billion cash as stated above; as such they have the ability to innovate without incurring debt. They also have a highly supportive shareholder and customer base, which means there will be strong and perpetual buying pressure. An increase in interest allows them to raise further capital as time progresses as the need arises for innovations. These innovations could be exploring Virtual Reality, or going with a hybrid formula similar to both Amazon's and Netflix's plan is completely up to AMC's shareholders and AMC's board of directors.

However, the purpose of this section was to show how AMC is not just a meme stock (it is, but it also in my opinion an undervalued stock, allowing potential buyers to generate value in their positions, at the current ask price); but an excellent long term hold. As such, I'd like to end this section by saying the following:

Throughout this section I explored the future growth potential of AMC; as such I believe whether it's acquired by a larger company, or forges its future itself, the stock is highly undervalued. The value of this stock will be not determined by any narratives; but by shareholders of AMC, as well as the business itself as it continues to generate revenue for its customers and shareholders.

\----Connection to the Short Squeeze----

This topic is unavoidable; as such I believe it should be addressed head on. As stated in the beginning of this article, this article has been dedicated to discussing the long-term growth prospects of AMC, and why I believe it has immense growth potential. This has been directly shown using mathematics, price and sentiment analysis, why this stock should grow naturally regardless of a short squeeze (to an extremely high price too according to fidelity). As such, this article is to help people who may be doubting their investment in AMC, due to all the fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the stock; as such this article presents a long-term outlook on the hypothetical price action of AMC regardless of the squeeze.

Thus, hopefully, allows people to sleep better at night if they are holding AMC.

Now, lets talk about the squeeze that I know many of you may have on your minds; I stand by my words written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the\_inevitability\_of\_amc\_2k\_based\_on\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the_inevitability_of_amc_2k_based_on_current/), I still believe the price floor for AMC being 2k, especially after the last 2 week's suspicious price actions. To say the least, we have cemented the floor more than ever (plus I said there will be massive FUD from AMC shorters and the Media going forward; one that comes to mind is Motley Fool for instance). However, I'm starting to lean towards the fact that the price floor must be much higher, due to this stock being manipulated at a higher rate (similar to synthetic CDO's back in 07/08 when the housing market exploded). This is still being researched, but I'll leave you guys with a couple sources in relation to GME;

Comments on GME trading halt and the hypothetical price if it wasn't halted:

Here's some proof that GME did almost hit 10k right before trading halts:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc\_robinhood\_hodlers\_you\_must\_turn\_off\_instant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc_robinhood_hodlers_you_must_turn_off_instant/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short\_mr\_on\_amc\_200\_in\_questrade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short_mr_on_amc_200_in_questrade/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did\_we\_break\_gme\_9999\_on\_the\_ask\_and\_frozen\_on\_td/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did_we_break_gme_9999_on_the_ask_and_frozen_on_td/reddit)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme\_bidask\_hits\_limit\_in\_tda\_2509999/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme_bidask_hits_limit_in_tda_2509999/)

Now within those links it shows that the margin requirement to short AMC is 200%, and GME was only at 120%; just based on the math, AMC can match if not exceed GME's initial non-halted squeeze of roughly 10k. However, I'm still working out all the math if 10k AMC is viable (I'm leaning to a yes so far though, but I'll keep you guys posted). So I'll be conservative and put the floor at 5k for now upon initial observations. Now, there still must be a lot of math to be worked out guys, so don't take it as straight facts. This is just initial speculation, but I believe the floor may be much higher in the case of a short squeeze at $5k ish. In addition, Fidelity's charts agree long-term this could be a $1.1k+ stock. So it's more than mathematically viable, as I have demonstrated in this article.

\-----Summation----

So to wrap it all up in a pretty bow, I believe the fundamentals, sentiment, momentum, consolidation and future potential of AMC, make it a very strong buy in my opinion.

This has not only been reflected by recent price action and an increase in buy volume, but also accompanied by main street sentiment towards AMC.

I believe this will continue until shareholders determine the value of AMC; thus satisfying the free markets quest to find the true price.

Finally, as customary within my articles, I'd like to leave an appropriate quote or two to summarize the article. Since this article is dedicated to the long-term price action and value of AMC, let's take today's quotes from the ancient past:

""Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed""- Heraclitus of Ephesus.

""It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light"" - Aristotle.

As the wise men of the past have indicated, value is not created over night, it takes patient and protracted effort to create and reward value, however the fruit of the labor is usually sweet; so I believe whenever the price is found for AMC, the shareholders will be rewarded by their patience and effort with sweet profit.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on the price action of AMC, and its future prospects. I hope the rest of your day goes well and you are successful in your endeavors.

This of course is solely my opinion, and not financial advice.

\---TLDR---

For people who don't feel like reading, and apes; the article shows long-term you'll get profit/tendies of a price floor according to Fidelity of $1k+ minimum long-term, as such, if you continue to buy and hold; mathematically you will not only reach tendieland (high profit for those who don't speak wsb), but your tendies (profits) will be nice and crisp.","['CL', 'BLK', 'NFLX', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']"

Hello everyone, I have managed retirement funds, but I have personally never purchased or sold a stock. I have about $3500 to play around with and thought I might enjoy doing some trading in my free time. I've spent the last few weeks looking at a variety of different stocks and have honed into Scholastic (SCHL) as a potential buy. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I am curious about your thoughts.

Both my wife and I are teachers and so we've been thinking about companies that have suffered during COVID that may rebound with the return of in-person learning. Many of those companies are already at, or approaching 5-year highs, and so I see no value in those particular stocks. However, Scholastic is currently trading around $29 which appears to be near 1-year highs, but still far from pre COVID averages. I'm thinking it will level out around $38 in the next year, and perhaps reach highs of $45.

That being said, I'm simply looking at historic charts. I've done very little DD and I haven't found much info in the news. The little I've seen says to sell. But why? Many of the school-based stocks seem to be recovering rapidly, why wouldn't Scholastic? What do you all know that I am failing to understand?

So I went to [https://www.similarweb.com/](https://www.similarweb.com/) to see the traffic history comparing the two sites, and there are some major differences.

Looking at some  Engagement basics for February:

Total Visits:  DraftKings- 12.35M     PNGaming- 112.49K

This is huge.  PENN really doesn't even show up on the graph comparing the two.

Avg. Visit duration: DraftKings- 13:19       PNGaming- 01:06

DKNG is longer than the average YouTube video, while PENN shows people are visiting and leaving faster than it probably took you to read this far.

Pages per Visit: DraftKings-  9.13             PNGaming-  2.52

ma3xz0,grqhu1p,stocks,comment,1616357473,"They’re pivoting. I don’t think it’s fair to compare revenues for anything in 2020 - their core business was basically shuttered the entire year (casinos).

They’re now spending to expand into sports betting in many states. They are poised for a huge surge in revenue once more states open up to sports betting and their regional physical casinos can open to the old normal. 

They’ve also been wildly successful with their online sports book compared to others in the states they’re in. December 2020 they had a 19% hold (profit from all bets; [source](https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1351636718437490688?s=21)). Industry “normal” is between 5-10%, with anything above 10% is seen as an unreal profit.

Their differentiation between them an DKNG, FD, MGM, etc - is they aren’t spending millions on promos and advertising. Penn’s purchase of a portion of Barstool has allowed them to have a built in marketing army that doesn’t need to offer $500 play credit with initial deposits or needs to run advertisement during nationwide sporting events (disclosure - I don’t live in a state where Penn operates an online sports book - they very well may be advertising hard in those states). Barstool does their shtick, makes money for themselves through their sponsors with their streams, shows, blogs, events (launch weekend in Chicago this weekend for example) and makes money for PENN through their droves of fans using Barstool Sportsbook as their online interface. 

They’re only operating in 5 states or so (no research but I think it’s just NJ, PA, MI, IL for now - I’m sure I’m missing somewhere). I think the price is reflective of the inevitability of it coming to 20, 30, eventually 50 states plus territories.

While I think they’re probably overvalued on today’s metrics - I see the appeal long term with the projection they can duplicate their current success in the states they’re operating in when then add other states (note: currently not in FL, CA, NY, TX, OH, GA, NC - 7 of the top 10 states in terms of population). 

Disclosure - I am long in DKNG and think the TAM for online sports betting is HUGE and will be eventually legalized in all 50 states in one form or another.","['TWTR', 'MGM']"

After the 5 years are up, the industry is already disrupted. It can’t be disrupted again (by the same tech or business model). The growth for the company has slowed now that they have their advantage in the market. Or the patents on the disruptive tech expire or whatever else.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/tesla-in-a-bubble-and-its-going-down-fund-manager-says.html

What bears don't understand is the very real possibility of bubble recoveries.

Just a few years ago, one currency-related bubble hyped hard and crashed hard.  Guess what?  It's back, folks!

Just a couple of years ago, the pot stock bubble hyped hard and crashed hard.  Guess what?  It's back, folks!

The Tesla and other EV bears are saying that *now* is the time for the stock to crash 80%.

This morning, Cathie Wood gave a $3,000 price target for Tesla (TSLA) to hit by 2025.

Reality is probably in between both of these two arguments.

I think Tesla can hit $3,000 *before* 2025.

I also think that the stock and other hyped EV stocks *will* crash 80% afterwards.

I also think that the stock and other hyped EV stocks will recover and break past pre-crash levels within just a couple of years after their crashes.

Why is that?

Tesla and other hyped EV stocks are not Cisco (CSCO).  They are not up against 6% yields on 10-year US treasuries.  Bond yields have trended downward for decades.  Despite the howling and screaming of conservative bond vigilantes, negative interest rates could come by the time the economy takes the next big hit.

maixu3,grudict,investing,comment,1616439908," 

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['JPM', 'ADI']"

Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). 

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic.

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['HD', 'NDAQ']"

Canadian Pacific is buying Kansas City Southern in a ~$25B deal - ~22% premium to Friday's closeKansas City Southern ($KSU) was the last class 1 railroad after the big 6 (BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific, and Canadian National) that had not yet been acquired or taken private. There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)  
Here is the [powerpoint presentation](https://ssl.lvl3.on24.com/event/30/20/89/4/rt/1/documents/resourceList1616341384560/cpkcsannouncementdeck32110amfinal1616341383050.pdf) being shown in this conference call

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['UNP', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'KSU']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

ma29dn,grsamuq,investing,comment,1616394655,"Perhaps my story can be instructive. I am 55 years old. I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

Is it possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify incorrectly priced stocks? Sure, if they have non-public information about that company.

They might have a leg up in feeling the sentiment of the market, but I think even there, social media scrapers are probably more effective.

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above.",

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

m9dmdf,,investing,post,1616266670,"Financial Market PessimismFinancial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

m9i525,,investing,post,1616280238,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

Furthermore, taking a quick glance at their financial statements, marketing is by far the largest expense item on their P&L. A potential green flag is their marketing expenses are much lower for the T9Ms in FY20 vs FY19. But, has Management indicated they are going to cut back on that spending and think they are starting to get some stickiness in their user base?

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",

The WSJ used to have an ""arbitrage"" portion in their paper to describe the cost of common goods like a cup of coffee or a BMW X5 (which was massive exported from the US market to the Chinese market for gain due to demand and currency price differences)  to let people know how much they're getting here, and abroad.",

- PBOC and other finance folks are the smart ones in the room.

- Military is filled with war mongers who don't understand economics. 

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0. US will fall back to Latin America for cheap labor, etc. 

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity. The island itself is worthless. You take Taiwan by force and you gain nothing but a small piece of land. Taiwanese will leave en masse.",

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

m8o362,,investing,post,1616179606,"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )  

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m8o362,grjfujb,investing,comment,1616198653,"I live in Colombia and there are some key points worth knowing before entering this move:

1. **The regulation is volatile.** The government party does not support completely medicinal cannabis. President only supported it with the condition on being more strict on licenses (benefiting big producers as Clever) because his hated predecesor had a more progressive agenda on cannabis. Two years ago there were rumors about an official request looking for a reduction in our global quota. Never happened.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['UPS', 'PGR']"
m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

32 years old

Wait in the market strategy, I am in it for the long run. Intent to invest as much as possible, as I am frugal for the most part.

No debt

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

I am looking for more options, perhaps 5% in Crypto currency? More single stocks like Tesla? Another index fund? I was looking at the home/landlord market, but the capital needed to get in is pretty high with the current house market, but it has a lot of gains too.

m8ugyr,,investing,post,1616197509,"GAW (Warhammer) & Cineworld Group DD# ***Disclaimer, positions and reasoning for post.***

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know. 

**Positions:**

I have a handful of shares in Cineworld Group (CWD/CNNWF) and am considering investing in both Games Workshop Group (GAW/GMWKF) and Brewdog, when it eventually IPOs.

[Games workshop annual reports and half-year results](https://investor.games-workshop.com/annual-reports-and-half-year-results/) 

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

m8ugyr,grmpuy8,investing,comment,1616274792,"I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

m8ugyr,grlkrn9,investing,comment,1616255601,"Interesting, love the outside the box picks.

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

It also appears they may not be able to meet upcoming long term debt covenants. It requires Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of below 5.5x by June. To me, they’re not going to meet this.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway. 

I don’t think theatres will be able to operate back at normal capacity for years with the move to streaming platforms and lack of big blockbuster productions during the pandemic year. It’ll be a steep uphill climb ... or a drop off the cliff.",

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance.

However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too. 

Otherwise I believe its a good buy in the short term",['AMZN']
m7ptq2,,investing,post,1616070867,"Jobless claims: Another 770,000 Americans filed new unemployment claimsU.S. new weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 770,000 last week even amid a wave of abating social distancing restrictions and improving weather.

The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

   Continuing claims, week ended March 6: 4.124 million vs. 4.034 million expected and 4.144 million during the prior week

Initial unemployment claims were expected to hold below 800,000 for a fourth consecutive week. Still, initial jobless claims remain above the Great Recession-era high of 665,000 from 2009. And new claims still need to fall significantly further to return to 2019 levels, when new claims averaged just over 200,000 per week.

Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between [Visa](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE) and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?   


Supporting this idea, [Apple](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ) is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, [Facebook](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FB:NASDAQ?window=1Y) is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak.   


What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech? Will small and medium Tech and Financial stocks see any boost relative to those with massive market capitalization? Or is this all not having much of a market impact at all, and we'll see even Visa's and Apple's stocks jump back up later in the year?","['SPGI', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'NDAQ']"

But what people forget is you also don’t want to buy long-duration equities,” Bernstein, CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC’s “[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/)” on Wednesday. “What’s a long-duration equity? Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

**The narrative**

1. Chinese   energy production by source: Coal 58% Petro 20% Hydro 8% LNG 8%   Renewable 5%  Nuclear 2%. Renewables have had an amazing 10 years with   explosive growth, Liquids and Nuclear growth is more modest but Nuclear   curve is steeper. The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)

Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal. "" full  article [here](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210312A0AAON00)
2. The  stock is slightly overvalued and I have a hard time comparing it to  other stocks or indexes. (data source yahoo finance)Trailing P/E 	16.15   Price/Sales (ttm)	1.94  Price/Book (mrq)	1.46  Enterprise Value/Revenue  7.28  Enterprise Value/EBITDA  11.38

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?  


My  background: New to the channel and to reddit, I was brought here by  crypto.I  am looking into subject company, considering that the net-0  emissions  targets are only possible by nuclear energy. I have always  admired the clean and cheap features of nuclear energy, I always  supported it and I anticipate it's golden era.Now, on investing, I would  like your take on  this company, and to initiate discussions which will  circle knowledge  through.Bear in mind that there are some restrictions  to investing in  this company if you are an American at the time of  writing.Last, I  want to avoid the trap of replicating the returns i got  from crypto. My  thinking is long term >5 years and I give weight  both on the  narrative and on fundamentals.",

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much, it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

Since this post, numerous people have messaged me with more information around FTFT. I personally found it very insightful and thought this community would as well. I've looked deeper into those comments and this is what I've found.

This is not financial advice.

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

---

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grd5s0u,investing,comment,1616078801,Incredible.  I already posted this below your original post: it reads like the script for a Netflix docuseries.,['NFLX']
m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat. 

Looking forward to seeing the stock price go to less than a $1.",['TWTR']

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['ETSY', 'AMZN', 'PYPL', 'EBAY']"

It's a sinking ship currently, and they need a really big idea to plug a lot of holes. 

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['AMZN', 'FB', 'EBAY']"

m6yvdo,,investing,post,1615982617,"Fed Set To Reaffirm Dovish Stance With Powell Likely To Urge PatienceBolstered by the impact of fiscal and Covid-19 stimulus packages, the US Federal Reserve is expected to forecast an improving economic outlook with the labour market and inflation to rebound faster than anticipated in December.

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

m71yzd,,investing,post,1615992262,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

With the massive influx of people into ""reddit investing"" I assume a significant percentage to be novice (I'm trying to keep it polite). 

That being said, the less sophisticated the  investor, the more likely they would be to act ""later"" and with less regard to risk and volatility. And yet I believed they WOULD act. 

I really feel as if the last 2 months has created a FOMO phenomenon and that there is significant, traditionally irrational buying. 

I just could not figure out a way to quantify and then be able to act on it.

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.","['WMT', 'AMZN']"

m7c1ig,grbowud,investing,comment,1616046384,It may not be physical... but I know an ass whoopin when I see one. Great fucking points and $Tusk has my complete and undivided attention.,
m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['ED', 'PWR']"
m6w7uv,,investing,post,1615972004,"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.As I see it:

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

In the current environment, with so much liquidity pouring into the markets, sure, inflation is a great concern. But truth is, every country in the world is spending like there is no tomorrow due to the pandemic, and they have to finance that spending with either taxes (not really an option short term due to the anemic economy) or debt.

2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter","['NDAQ', 'MSFT', 'SBUX', 'GOOGL']"

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['PGR', 'GPS']"

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['TXN', 'ARKK', 'MMM', 'QCOM', 'IBM', 'INTC', 'NVDA', 'BA', 'TER']"

m7c6gf,,investing,post,1616019296,"Apple (fruit) stock analogySo many people are talking about stocks this year, which is similar to the past times when stocks are shooting up and the majority of people are generally winning for now, and feeling good about it, and eager to talk about it, for all sorts of reasons.  

That includes everyone from novice investors to advanced and sophisticated investors, and everyone in between.

One of the most concerning things I hear is this.  

""You should by X.""

""Why?""

""Oh, it was 300 dollars yesterday.  It's 250 now.  So it's cheap.  It's going to go back up"".

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

Good luck out there, be careful, and have fun.",['AAPL']

The only thing I care about is buying securities at better than a 20% to 50% discount to their fair value vis-à-vis discounted cash flow analysis.  That is an objective metric... it doesn't matter who performs the math.  The math is the math.

I don't get excited.  I don't get depressed.  I don't get impatient.

This is the method of Benjamin Graham, whose star pupil was Warren Buffett.  Others include Walter Schloss, Stan Perlmeter, Bill Ruane.  They did just fine for themselves.

Don't care.  I could be losing x times more too, and every dollar lost today is 160 future dollars gone forever.

""But you could be missing out on the next Tesla.""

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

Is there a Vanguard index fund that encompasses his description of Asian/Chinese emerging markets?

 I check the reason UC browser got deleted from app store is they advertise fake medicines(the drug promise lower blood sugar, or losing weight but it's all bullshit) and that's illegal in China. Not only BABA's app got deleted they are many other app got warning. Including 360(a big cyber security company), multiple job searching app, ford(transmission problem), Infiniti(transmission problem), Kohler, Max Mara(install face recognition camera in their store to analyze customer), and many other companies.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM.

m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.  The once mighty Grand Met is no more.","['AAPL', 'FB', 'KO', 'AMZN', 'BRK.B']"
m6lakz,,investing,post,1615933928,"Plug power - unravelling the jargonI do love having a go at deciphering the management bullsh8t when they have dodgy accounts (sorry if you own it). Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.


Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

m69ifj,,investing,post,1615902668,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['BLK', 'UPS', 'NDAQ']"

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.
Looking forward to discussing potential supports and counterarguments to this thesis.","['CHD', 'MOS', 'CF', 'CTVA']"

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

Q4 earnings miss GAAP EPS off by 7.7%.  FCF analysis puts fair value at $134.  DCF EPS even lower.

It doesn't matter that they had a strong quarter.  What matters is that they set an expectation with investors and missed it by almost 8% or 11.7 cents per share (~$311 million total) in a year where they had been beating earnings by double digit percentages and hadn't had an EPS miss since Q4 2020.  Prices were moving on that expectation and when it failed to materialize, investors penalized WMT.

This continues to further Graham and Buffett's view that stocks trading in excess of their fair value are more susceptible to downward pressure particularly when the market is pricing in earnings that don't materialize as expected.   It should be noted that Buffett doesn't ""buy the ... dip"".... He looks for securities that are trading well below their fair value, typically 30 to 50% below fair value rather than right on the cusp of it, regardless of price movements in relation to near-term highs.",['WMT']

m60b98,,investing,post,1615866531,"I have to be missing something about the EV spaceI have been in the markets since college, about 6 years ago. I am not an expert and have my fair share of misses. This isnt a typical ""doomsday"" post. In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players.","['GM', 'ICE', 'TSLA']"

(*Disclaimer:* I could be defined as a mega-bull on the what I'll call broadly the 'electrification' opportunity that faces the world in the 1-2 coming **decades,** EVs being a big part of that). I'll start with my thoughts and then answer your questions. I also work in the space, and have been following it as an energy nerd for...a long time).

I would say **I am very concerned** about the 'EV froth' right now. With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

I know its been long, but I hope it was worthy of the read. I can always write and share more if there are specific questions.

Edit: And answering your high level question about what you are missing, its that in my view and what I've seen, TSLA has been the one that has derisked a lot of the market and made the manufacturing progress (turning clearly cash flow positive forward looking as of January 2020....hmm) where they have crossed the chasm and are now on, a product manufacturing driven rocket ship. These other companies and the space have enjoyed the rising tides, hype, capital, and knowledge that it is possible. Then comes, the greed, the frauds, the bubble, and the damage. When the tide goes out, who will have no clothes? That is the core of what I think you might be missing about the space.","['ICE', 'TSLA']"

m6iaod,,investing,post,1615925770,"Dividends and performanceI had a question about dividends. If a company performs very well then their stock price will increase over the quarter. So when they give you dividends that means you are able to re-invest in less shares than if they would have given you the same dividends and they had performed less well. 

Am I understanding this correctly? I know that dividends are tied to performance so does that end up balancing out my scenario? I was specifically looking at some of the high dividend yield ETFs and this question popped up

m6iaod,gr68so0,investing,comment,1615932832,"short answer: yes you are right.

&#x200B;

you buy 100 shares at $10 with 10% dividend and market cap of 10 thousand( and the outstanding shares are 1000) that means 

the dividend is is $1 per share with it you can buy 10 shares

if the price goes up to  $20 what would change?

well the market cap would change to 20 thousand but the outstanding shares stayed the same :(

but your dividend percentage would also change :( to 5%

so your dividend would be the (market cap \* the percentage) / the number of shares 1000) \* the amount of shares you own would be still be $100  woot same money!

but your purchasing power went down so now you can only buy 5 shares.",
m6iaod,gr5wuro,investing,comment,1615927239,"

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",
m6iaod,gr68t4c,investing,comment,1615932838,"The company decides what to do with their budget.   

Some spend all their money (wisely or not).  The goal is to grow the business,  build another factory, or buy more trucks or whatever.   Sometimes that means buy a smaller company.   If they grow wisely,  the value of the stock goes up.

Some try to grow, but slowly,  maybe there aren't any good opportunities at the time so they could buy back their stock with the extra cash.  This makes the value of the stock go up. 

Some return the money to the shareholders as dividends. 

You can find different combinations of these.  Some growing companies may periodically pay a one off special dividend. Others pay a small but routine dividend, and grow or buy back shares depending on opportunities.   Others just keep stable and pay most of the profits as dividends, and as the years roll on with inflation they will try to raise the dividend every year. 

Each of the attract different types of investors so they try to stick with a strategy. For example, retired people like to count on dividends as income so you see utilities finance growth with bonds and maintain the dividend because if they cut the dividend those people would all sell.  Cyclical companies pay dividends in good times and cut it in down cycles.",

**Introduction** 

During a casual scroll through the dregs of Robinhood, I stumbled upon a listing that caught my eye: Future Fintech ($FTFT), a China-based “blockchain e-commerce financial technology company” that’s up an impressive 455% over the past year. Featuring a market cap of \~$500m and share price of \~$5.50 (at the time of discovery), it appeared at first glance to be a player in a hot sector with plenty of room to run. I decided to do a deep-dive into their history, products, and SEC filings as an exercise in due diligence.  

What I found was bewildering – and a great lesson in why doing your own thorough research before investing is vital. Let’s take a look at what I found. 

**A Brief Company History** 

$FTFT wasn’t always a pioneer in one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. Before pivoting to blockchain, e-commerce and crypto in 2018, $FTFT produced and sold fruit juice - yes, seriously - as SkyPeople Foods Holding Ltd. (“SkyPeople”). The carcass of the company dates all the way back to 1998, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on their recent history. 

SkyPeople was brought onto the NASDAQ via secondary offering through underwriters Rodman & Renshaw (featured in the documentary *The China Hustle*), who have a history of bringing sketchy Chinese microcap companies to market and [violating Finra rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/finra-fines-rodman-renshaw-for-analysts-actions.html). Interestingly, SkyPeople settled a [$2.2m class action lawsuit](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf) (.pdf link) in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1,000%** and failing to disclose a **related-party transaction** involving their former CFO, Yongke Xue (now board chairman), to shareholders. 

According to their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm), the transition to their latest business focus hasn’t been going so well: “The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised **substantial doubts about its ability to continue** as a going concern” (pg. 7). As of September 30, 2020, positive operating cashflows were predominantly related to stock compensation and discontinued operations – not their stated core business (pg. 3). The quick ratio for their 3Q2020 financials (0.057) indicates that the company doesn’t have adequate liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities. 

  
Compounding their troubles is a **subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement** issued on February 21, 2020, addressing their accounting practices, management oversight, and the sale of one of their subsidiaries (pg. 16). Note that this critical piece of information is missing from their website’s [news page](http://ftft.top/en/news.html). 

Their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm) \- the last one filed with the SEC - details their routine, schizophrenic changes in name and business focus since 1998, as well as their suspiciously complicated and web-like organizational structure, portrayed on a [chart](https://imgur.com/PNFqHLj) (pg. 4) featuring font so small that it’s impossible to read.  

In addition to being an industry leader in juice production and blockchain technology, $FTFT is also an innovator in taking out loans, leases, and service contracts, defaulting on them, and getting slapped with judgements in court, boasting an impressive record of [**20 defaults and lawsuits**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006) in six years (2014-2019, pgs. 42-45).  Furthermore, they’ve regularly been in danger of being delisted by NASDAQ due to their **persistent failure to file reports on time** (pg. 40). 

Now that we’ve scratched the surface of this industry heavyweight’s complex history, let’s examine $FTFT’s products and services. 

**Blockchain, E-Commerce, and Crypto – Oh My!** 

According to $FTFT’s website, [www.ftft.top](http://www.ftft.top/), their core revenue generators revolve around blockchain-enabled e-commerce. We’ll take a brief, critical look at each of them below. 

**“Chain Cloud Mall”,** AKA “GK Shared Mall” ([www.gksharedmall.com](http://www.gksharedmall.com/)), is described on their website as an “...innovative B2B2C e-commerce platform created by well-known investment bankers, e-commerce and blockchain technology industry elites, financial technology experts, and sharing economy scholars."" In reality, it appears to be a standard, boring retail platform, absent of any evidence whatsoever that blockchain & fintech “experts” and “scholars” were involved in its creation, or that blockchain technology is even in place at all. It’s replete with dead links and has seemingly little engagement. In fact, according to their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm), it generated an abysmal **$0.54m** in revenue from a total of **6,401 users**. 

**“NONOGIRL”** is a “cross-border e-commerce platform” that, in reality, appears to be a standard-web auction site that was seemingly [abandoned 7 months ago](https://imgur.com/aH4B94h) according to the NONOGIRL LinkedIn page. It’s unclear if the site was ever launched; searches on [www.baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com/) and the Google Play Store return no direct results to the platform. 

**“DCON”** is a “blockchain-based application incubator and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets” that appears to be dead in the water, as [the associated coin never appears to have been released](https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R). No development updates are available on $FTFT’s website for either the “incubator” project or the DCON platform itself. 

**Conclusion** 

All publicly available evidence points toward this name being an incredibly risky investment with a hefty amount of downside looming overhead. Major red flags abound – and to those holding long positions in this company: **invest with caution**.

m5kkxa,,investing,post,1615814594,"Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

m58453,,investing,post,1615767209,"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely workedhttps://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",

mb5emp,,StockMarket,post,1616469763,"CRSR DD**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at it's current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

^(7) [^(https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)](https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering it's growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

mb4pen,,StockMarket,post,1616467419,"An update on the site I built that combines stock posts across social media For those unfamiliar with this project I basically built a site that takes posts from 24 different subreddits on reddit as well as from thousands of popular investing twitter, YouTube, and tiktok users and places them into one searchable and organized place all the while collecting data on popularity, sentiment, and price movement. Since the official release, I have built tools to help analyze that data and the result are pretty cool if I don't say so myself. Here are some of the features:

**CUSTOM STOCK ALERTS**

You can build your own email alert notifications to find trending stocks based off a range of parameters including; top number of stocks you want to check, social media/subreddits you want to check, time frame you want to check, and what sentiment you want to check. For example: Email me every time a ticker symbol enters the top 10 most talked about tickers across the subreddit(s): [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) and the social media site(s): twitter, tiktok that has not trended over the last 7 day(s) and has bullish sentiment.

**ADVANCED TRENDING**

You can see the trending stocks based off any investing subreddit/social media you choose, as well as pick how many days you want to check (up to 30) and the amount of trending stocks you want to see (up to 50). The site will then return: the amount of posts containing that stock as well as the overall sentiment for all the posts containing that stock. For example: Show me the top 25 most talked about stocks on the subreddits [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the social media site(s): youtube over the last 24 hours.

**Past Alerts**

Here you see your most recent trending stock alerts including: date/time, price at time of alert, sentiment at time of alert, current price, current sentiment, price change since alert, and sentiment change since the alert. At the top you can also see the overall price % change from alerts with bullish/bearish sentiment. This allows you to see which custom alerts give the best returns and help you build a winning strategy.

**STOCK/SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

This tool takes in a stock ticker and a time frame (1 day, 1 week, or 1 month). The site will then return:

1. The current stats of the stock: current price/price percent change, current sentiment, and amount of posts the stock has appeared in over the past day.
2. The overall change stats: This is the percent change in price, sentiment, and mentions over the time period specific by the user.
3. Day by day analysis: This will show the the day by day statistics of price, sentiment, and mentions over the time period specific by the user.
4. Posts by social media: This will show the total number of posts within the time period specified by the user and what social media those posts came from.

There are a few other features but these are the biggest ones that have the most value in my opinion. This site has grown to be the end all be all of analyzing social media trends and stock prices and has been an extremely fun project to work on. I wanted to share with you all and believe this could serve as useful of a tool for you guys as it has been for me :)

max8zy,,StockMarket,post,1616445191,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 22, 2021Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

mb4twb,,StockMarket,post,1616467839,"Thoughts on European telecom diversification plays.So this is going to serve as a bit of DD and Discussion but I’m wanting to hear others opinions on these companies and hear what y’all’s outlooks are on them vs mine. 

So first up is Vodafone Group PLC (VOD); a company that pays semiannual dividends with a 5.7% yield, a current price around $18.65, a PT between $22.60-$25.48, an average PT of $24.04 and a P/B ratio of only .76. Looking at these numbers alone it seems like VOD is undervalued and when you look at their expansion into Africa and India as well as cementing their status as Europe’s discount cell service for all backpackers/tourists/Americans stationed overseas (they actually have contracts with the US military to sell their phones and chips directly to Americans on base in the military’s PX’s and BX’s)/students studying abroad you can see how qualitatively they also have a lot going for them. Personally I’m looking to begin dollar cost averaging in to VOD as I find both their yield and growth prospects attractive. Not to mention I used them while I was living in Germany and so did every single kid in my school. 

The second company I would like to discuss with y’all is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE) or for those of us in the states (DTEGY). DTEGY pays only a yearly dividend with a 3.47% yield and trades around $19.65 with a PT range between $15.53-$29.82, an average TP of $23.85 and a much more average P/B ratio of 2.16. While these numbers aren’t as great as VOD it is still the largest telecommunication provider in all of Europe, and also owns like 45% of T-mobile so they are getting a large amount of revenue from America’s 3rd largest cellular network. While I haven’t found anything on them expanding into emerging markets I have seen their recent huge investments into 5G and how they are making moves to solidify their 5G network to maintain their largest in Europe status. 

So do y’all have any thoughts on VOD and DTEGY? Personally I’m going to be buying a few shares of both and just watch how 5G continues to roll out. I also like them as they offer me some international exposure and diversification. Personally I hate AT&T due to dealing with them for years as a customer and as such don’t want to invest in them but still want some more communication sector diversification outside of VZ and DIS that still pays a decent dividend.

maus2g,,StockMarket,post,1616438599,"I built a program that spots buzzing stocks on Reddit & Twitter. Here are the resultsHello all, I have built a python program that scrapes Reddit & twitter to identify emerging stocks.

# How does it work?

It does this by assessing the amount a stock is mentioned, the sentiment of the chatter surrounding that stock (how positive or negative that chatter is) and the interactions surrounding that chatter (upvotes, likes, retweets etc.)

The algorithm surfaces emerging stocks by looking at which stocks have seen a regular, non-spiky increase in chatter surrounding a stock.

The algorithm tries to remove pump and dump stocks by filtering out the short interest group of stocks (BB, NOK, GME, AMC etc), removing stocks that have seen a single spike in chatter, and ignoring chatter by newly created accounts.

# How to use this?

The tool is meant to be used as a way to identify stocks early, enabling you to perform research and enter into a stock at an early stage. It has allowed me to identify opportunities such as PLUG, SRNE, PLTR and MGNA.

*Just because something appears here does not mean you should purchase it. Please do your own research beforehand!*

# Results

There are two sets of results, showing the stocks with the biggest movement in chatter, and the stocks that were talked about the most.

maytmx,,StockMarket,post,1616449513,"(NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio DD (NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio Inc DD

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders.

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley. Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1. Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth.
2. Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin.

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue.

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR.

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to.

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded.

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million.

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season.

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-22.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq futures rise as 10-year Treasury yield retreats

> * The Nasdaq on Monday was set to build on Friday’s nearly 0.8% increase as the 10-year Treasury yield started the new week retreating from last week’s 14-month high. The rapid rise in Treasury yields this year have been pressuring growth stocks, many of them tech names, tech stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, which lost ground Friday, joined the Nasdaq in negative territory for the week. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs Wednesday, while the Nasdaq last closed at a record in February.

> # 2. AstraZeneca vaccine found to be 79% effective in U.S. trial

> * AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness, according to data published Monday from a 32,000-plus person Phase 3 trial in the U.S. The two-shot vaccine also showed a 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. AstraZeneca plans to file with the FDA for emergency use authorization in April. The U.S. trial data comes as a number of European nations temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. AstraZeneca said in a release Monday that an independent board identified no safety concerns related to its inoculation.

> # 3. Covid cases are rising in 21 states as governors relax restrictions

> * Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates in the U.S., Covid cases are increasing in 21 states and highly infectious variants are spreading as governors relax restrictions on businesses. Public health officials warn that while roughly 2.5 million people around the country are receiving shots every day, infection levels have plateaued this month. Nationwide, new infections are holding around 54,000 on average in the past seven days. That’s a dramatic drop from January’s peak. While deaths are much lower as well, an average of 1,000 people were still dying from Covid each day over the past seven days.

*****

> # 4. Canadian Pacific Railway to buy Kansas City Southern

> * Canadian Pacific Railway has agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The combination would create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Following Sunday’s announcement, shares of Kansas City Southern rose about 17% in the premarket, while shares of Canadian Pacific Railway dropped about 2.5%. The deal comes as hopes that U.S.-Mexico trade will pick up now that Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as U.S. president.

*****

> # 5. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sees Tesla reaching $3,000 per share by 2025

> * Shares of Tesla rose 4% in Monday’s premarket after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made a long-awaited, bold call, projecting the Elon Musk-led electric auto maker would more than quadruple by 2025. Last year, Ark Invest estimated Tesla would hit $1,400 adjusted for its five-for-one stock split by 2024. The firm now sees the stock reaching $3,000 per share by 2025 in its base case, and reaching $4,000 per share in its bull case. Wood’s bear case still sees hit hitting $1,500 by 2025. Tesla, which closed at $654 per share Friday, soared 665% in the past 12 months. However, the stock over the past month and year-to-date hit a rough patch.

📷

New Week same old worries... Can we keep the music playing and start walking back up the stairs or will this week be more like walking on a tread mill, a lot of energy spent but end up in the same place we started. Continue to keep your eyes on Bonds and Rates for any sharp moves that will anger the overall market.  Also Continue to focus on understanding day structure and identifying that as early as possible. A lot of focus will be on Range day structure, and notice how indicators like Bollinger bands, Keltner channels and price channels are more effective during these types of days. Now the 3 outcomes to prepare for today are 1) Can we hold above 390. If so, we push toward 392 area and possibly 393 if not today later this week. Be careful of quick down moves that may retest the low of the range. 2) we Consolidate between 388 and 392 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower3) we hold 390 support area and get a trend up day toward 393. 

1) Can we hold above 390. If so, we push toward 392 area and possibly 393 if not today later this week. Be careful of quick down moves that may retest the low of the range. **50% probability** 

2) we Consolidate between 388 and 392 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. **40% probability** 

3) we hold 390 support area and get a trend up day toward 393. **10% probability**

Untapped potential in midst of booming momentum music streaming. 

Views on China companies seem to be skewed due to  mainstream coverage of Alibaba’s government conflicts. Albeit Chinas govt does encroach on the growth and prosperity of its internet companies, TCHEY nearly falls into the same too big too fail category as BABA.

Music streaming trends have only benefited from latest macro impacts due to covid.

marp3s,,StockMarket,post,1616430563,"INVE--A story of Many Irons in the Fire. NFC and RFID chip boom could lead to hypergrowth for Identiv, a key manufacturer.***Identiv has Many Irons in the Fire.*** It is a small company, but despite that, it has several different interesting businesses and markets--each of which on its own could potentially lead to huge profits for the company. 



***RFID/NFC chip business.*** 

This is the one most talked about on reddit.

The Fruit Company:  On its earnings calls, INVE has signaled a close relationship with the fruit company on NFC technology. Hopefully INVE is involved in the new iTag or whatever they will call it. Regardless, the iPhone's adoption of NFC beyond applepay has opened the floodgates for NFC consumer tech adoption. 

Just as the Sony Playstation was a blue-ray player leading to massive blue-ray growth, the iPhone is now an RFID and NFC reader and interface which will likely lead to a huge amount of growth in the space. I cannot oversell this point enough. Everyone has an RFID and NFC reader in their hands.  

Technology edge: INVE appears to have a competitive advantage in designing and manufacturing custom NFC and RFID chips. It certainly doesn't hurt that their relationship with Apple means they likely have intimate knowledge of the most used NFC/RFID reader's tech. Additionally, they have a unique ability to produce them on cardboard for environmental reasons as well.

Broader RFID market: The RFID market is booming with warehousing and shipping booming, tracking is becoming a necessity. 

Recent Results: INVE grew RFID revenues 100% yoy in 4Q. 
APU is growing as well, leading to possibly higher margins for INVE in the space. 

INVE is a leader in the space in a growing market with growing margins. Soon comes the huge profits hopefully.

(and UWB may add to the story here as well.)


***Premises Commercial, Switch to Cloud and recurring revenue.***

Identiv has revamped the way it sells its premises security systems. Instead of just selling its systems for installers to install, INVE is pushing a services model through the cloud. This system will allow the customer to get better value from Identiv with more support, increased flexibility in the system, and better data. 

Importantly, this generates recurring revenue. Instead of getting a 1 time 40-60% margin sale, INVE can recoup its entire cost and breakeven in its first year of revenue and continually generate that same revenue year after year. As the years go own sales will go from 0% margin to 50% margin to 67% margin to 75% margin to 80% margin. Each year INVE is able to keep the customer happy and upgrade it's systems, margins will go up and up and up.


***Government Business***

The government business is growing rapidly due to INVE’s technology edge. Both the Thursby Identity unit and the Hirsch velocity accesss control units are performing here. 
From the 4Q20 earnings transcript:
“In 2020, the federal government remains a strong growth driver. Our federal sales grew 30% year-over-year. Driven by our technology strength and by work from home and work mobile demand. We had key deployments at the Department of Energy, Treasury, NIST [ph] FBI and IRS offices nationwide, VA hospitals, multiple secret service facilities, Air Force bases worldwide and lots of others.” 

“In the area of federal government expansion we expect the 30% growth in our federal business to continue as the new administration emphasizes physical security and cyber security. With our product superiority, we expect to continue to grow our share even in a healthy spending federal government market. Among recent wins than the federal government, we're securing the Secret Service headquarters, field offices and all the places basic here [ph]. Our security leadership also is behind some rather urgent delivery orders we recently got for the U.S. House of Representatives in the capital. And we'll share more wins and expansions throughout 2021.”

INVE added  retired Navy Vice Admiral Robin Braun to its board in 2019, which should hopefully help the company better understand the federal market and market its technology leading products in a way that resonates with key government stakeholders


***in Summation***

INVE’s market cap of $200mn leaves a lot of room for growth, however as an investment, it has to start breaking even or generating profit or shares will be diluted by additional capital raised. Humphrey has mentioned $100mn a year in revenue as a possible breakeven inflection point, which INVE could hit this year.

My thesis is that INVE has many areas for growth and if INVE is able to have a big success in any one of its core areas, that growth could carry the entire business past the inflection point. In other words, it has Many Irons in the Fire!! Once INVE becomes profitable it will help to alleviate its relatively tight working capital situation and drive less restricted investment and decision making, in turn creating more growth + profits. 

I think it’s possible for INVE to achieve a Fortune 500 valuation in a decade. 


(i am not telling any of you cretans to buy the stock, just providing my take. The market is a fickle beast and INVE is a tiny unprofitable company, so anything can happen.)

ma3ueh,,StockMarket,post,1616354326,"Cathie Wood: Inflation vs Deflationary forcesIn a recent video, Cathie goes back in time to the end of 2016 - Early 2017.

Quantitative easing was on its way out and the FED was going to start raising the interest rates. The market was very nervous...

Trump won the election and the odds of a cyclical burst increased because of his promise to cut taxes and that's exactly what happened!

In the beginning the equity market was very nervous around the idea that interest rates would be going up. When Trump was elected - value stock took off just like they're getting off now - responding to this idea that economy is developing ahead of steam so the value stocks have taken off.

If you look at year to date: energy stocks are up 27%, financial stocks 11%, tech stock 1% and health stocks are actually down. So basically traditional value stocks are having a nice run! So right now we are in a 2016 like scenario, value stocks are up and growth strategy stocks are down (Take ARK ETFs as a perfect example)

Cathie thinks this is great because the bull market is broadening out to other sectors and this - can only be a good thing for ""disruptive innovation"" stocks investors.

What would be negative instead? It would be a negative thing if the bull market continues to narrow and only innovation strategy worked, because that's what happened with the .com tech bubble in 2000. (And we all know how bad the consequences have been).

Cathie actually likes the fear that ARK is experiencing and that there's a reality check, in terms of the speculative moves that have taken place within the innovation space.

What happened post Q4 2016 after the market had broadened out? Well… 2017 was a fantastic year for the equity market in general with cyclical value and growth.  And she believes we're now moving towards a similar scenario.

Now let's find out what Cathie's said on Bitcoin being speculative, not sustainable, not environment friendly and heavily used for illicit activities. With a lot of respect Cathie says that Janet Yellen doesn't understand the crypto space, simply because it's not her main focus.

Regarding the environmental issue: comparing the energy required for BTC mining to the energy required to mine gold you can clearly see that the first is a fraction of the latter. It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC. 

She also reports what an FBI agent told her. According to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets. BTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.

Talking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases. So it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech. Regarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction… it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin. And the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.

Cathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation. ARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other. Good vs bad deflation. Good deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.

* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.
* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly. And according to ARK forecasts… EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.

Concluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:

* Robotics
* AI
* Blockchain
* DNA sequencing

And these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect. Think about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.

On the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned. The disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change. Financial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around. Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.

So we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.

&#x200B;

Let me set the scene right now. You’ve just spent three hours doing intense research finding the perfect stock to buy and hold for the next couple of days so you can reap in the wonderful profits. The market opens you find your option contract - exact strike and date - set your limit sell and BAM! You’re in.

>Market’s moving.  
You’re suddenly up 10% within minutes.  
A few minutes later your stock has increased eighty cents and you’re 30% up. Wow!  
Five minutes later you’re sitting at 65% gains.  
This is unbelievable.  
What’s going on!?  
You tell yourself you need to sell.  
But you can’t. You have no day trades available.  
Oops.

How many times have you found yourself in a similar situation? Of course, those profits may be exaggerated but there might be a time when you expected to hold overnight for 10-15% and suddenly find yourself above that. It can be frustrating because what happens if you hold? What happens if the stock pulls back and the sellers start taking profit. Are you going to be left behind? In many cases you will. However, it doesn’t have to be that way!

We can actually lock in profits right now even without a day trade available.

Say whaaaa????

Yep! You can do this by opening a Vertical Spread. Now because we aren’t buying together it won’t be 1 contract. However, it acts as the same.

So how do we do this?

It’s simple! Let’s look at an example:

Let’s say we purchased a put on BAC with the $38 strike price and a April 1st expiration and we got in with an 65 cent buy. Now our option is trading at $1.10 and we want to lock in gains.

**So what we do is the following:**

1. Go to the April 1st expirations for BAC.
2. Instead of looking at the BUY options look at the SELL
3. Since we purchased the $38 Put we want to SELL a put contract and decide to sell the $37.5 Put for 46 cents.
4. We now receive a $46.00 credit

So as of right now what have we done? Well, we are up $45.00 per contract on our original buy. We have now sold our second contract and received a credit of $46.00. Assuming nothing more happens and tomorrow the stock opens up exactly the same we may lose a little value to theta and the morning spread but essentially you’ll be up about the same amount.

**Now, whenever you go to cash in the next morning you have to do the following:**

1. **BUY** back the contract you sold. To do this all you have to do is go to the $37.5 Put and **BUY** the contract. This will relieve you from the contract you sold.
2. Once you have bought back the contract you sold you will be left with your original option contract that you bought. So now you need to close out this original contract.
3. Do your happy dance and make it rain dollar dollar bills!

Opening a Vertical Spread can help lock in money. It doesn’t always work though. If the stock begins to decrease in value overnight you may end up losing money on the original contract but because you sold a contract at the higher price as it decreases in value the more money you get to keep from it. However, let’s say something dramatic happens and the stock gaps down well below your original entry. Sure, you may be up on the credit sell you made but you might be down so far on the original contract that overall you’re now losing. The great thing is though even if you hadn’t opened the Vertical Spread you would have been down so essentially by doing the spread you limit the loss a bit.

Now, let’s say the next morning BAC continues to rise and has gapped up and your original contract has increased by another 20%. Well, you’re going to be down on the contract you sold as it has increased, but the original option is going to be worth more so by hedging with the **SELL** contract you have essentially safely locked in gains without risking too much of your capital overnight.",['BAC']

Tech 100 futures, however, are looking good.

I don't base too much on Nikkei, but am very interested to see how Taiwan and Hong Kong start the week. Those markets will start opening in just over 30m.

A few key thoughts I'm having:

1. I need to be ready to hedge for any loss that may be incurred by my tech-heavy portfolio, should there be a major shift in that sector (invested heavily in what I believe to be the bottom)

2.1 Will the upswing in oil Friday spill into this week? The Saudi's said Friday's attacks did not impact production, however that's basically what I would expect of them to say. But, then again, it's Aramco and it's capable of immense output to make up for the temporary disruption

2.2 Saudi's made an attack against Houthi rebel's, will there be some sort of retaliation this week? Could be worthwhile to have a put/call strategy in place -definitely worthwhile unless oil trades sideways

3. Qualcomm CEO had positive remarks with regard to the chip shortage... QUAL reached what I believe to be a bottom, and is one of the blue-chip stocks of the tech world. Would a play on QUAL be better than a play in AMD? Probably safer... Or would something like SOXL calls be better given the possibility of supply catching up to demand in the near term?

I am new to stocks. I just started buying a few months back when I became a working student to help my family with our financial crisis (which is caused by the pandemic).

I noticed that stock prices have been plummeting since the time I invested and there has been no profit since. I have considered that I may just be panicking because I'm new to stocks and that I should just hold. But I've already lost 10% of what I initially invested and the stock values are still going down.

I tried to read up on some factors that affect stock prices and one of them was politics. 

Our government is excessively borrowing money from other nations for ""emergency covid responses"" but I'm sure that the politicians have already pocketed everything for the upcoming elections (and just for their own good). We're on lockdown again and there has been no vaccinations. Vaccines btw, will be coming from private institutions who are forced by the government to donate the exact number of vaccines they'll be procuring for themselves to the government.

I'm not very good at studying the economy but I'm sure that excessive debts will cause our economy to plummet. And I'm thinking that this might be the reason why the stock shares I bought had been plummeting too. 

I'm sure that we will not be able to pay back our debts to other nations anytime soon. But I'm worried that this will also cause the stock market in our country to just crash. But I don't know much about the stock market to be sure.

maaoct,grs9agj,StockMarket,comment,1616393408,"It depends on what form the borrowing takes. You can't ask this just in general and get useful answers.

Here in the US, our government doesn't actually borrow money at all; when Americans talk about national debt, they're talking about how many Treasury Bonds have been issued. This makes it very safe; if we couldn't afford it, we'd only have to weaken our currency a little bit to reduce the debt. That would be slightly bad for us, so we wouldn't want to do it. But not a disaster.

A small country, it depends who you borrowed the money from, and what the guarantees are. If you borrowed it from China, your government agreed to turn anything over to them that they ask for if it can't be paid; your strategic national industries are the collateral, so if it can't be paid you're screwed.

If you borrowed it from the US, Europe, or similar, you're only risking your credit rating.👼",

ma93g7,,StockMarket,post,1616369276,"BNGO Earnings Likely Outcomes (could b wrong) 

Using the 3.8-4.2M dollar preliminary estimate from Erik and the BNGO team, I was able (I think lol unless I forgot or missed something, comment below if I screwed something up) to estimate and label the probabilities (imo) of each tier's exact EPS coming to fruition.

TLDR - IN MY OPINION, BNGO earnings, based primarily but not solely on the revenue estimates Erik (BNGO CEO) gave in a recent presentation, are extremely likely to beat the $-0.07 eps estimate from marketbeat, and a very likely chance to beat the $-0.05 eps estimate from yahoo average estimate.

DISCLAIMER (just give it a skim especially if you catch something I missed/neglected when making the calculations) - Please before saying this or that is wrong, please read this or at least skim it - I can easily be wrong about my calculations because I could have missed something. ALSO, I DID NOT SAY THIS IN THE VIDEO BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT - The total expenses I choose for all 5 tiers were basically just guesses going from unlikely (in a bearish way) to being fair to being unlikely (in a bullish way) basically. Because of this, THE EXACT EPS ESTIMATES I HAVE MADE ARE NOT IMPLYING THAT I THINK BNGO EARNINGS WILL ONLY BE 1 OF THEM EXACTLY ON THE CENT. It just means that that ones with the higher % chance I labeled them with will mean that for BNGO earnings, there is a higher chance actual EPS will turn out to be near or exactly in one of the tiers with higher chances in my opinion. It would have maybe been better to have a bit of a range of EPS estimates but that is more complicated because then I would have to do more total expenses guestimations and for a range I do not know exactly how that would have worked. I know this may seem complex and I could be wrong but I think based on this research that BNGO (as stated in video) has a higher change of beating earnings than missing in my opinion.

This below is what I typed in a google doc and presented/explained on my youtube channel link to the video here - [I Calculated Several BNGO Earnings Possibilities, What I Think (maybe) I Found Is Very Interesting - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1P0IJXzAo)

If just reading some things will seem a little out of place like the 'IF \_\_\_\_ IS NOT TRUE' part right near the top. But all in all I will just attempt to sum it up here articulately.

I assumed for all net income calculations that revenue is 4M (average of preliminary estimates in Erik's presentation) and for the total expenses (variable that changes in each 5 tiers) I started with the worst case scenario (in my mind, but technically speaking they could have a much higher total expenses than what I assumed, in my assumptions I did a number which was more than double the average quarterly total expenses from 2017-2019 average and in this of course you actually want if you are a bull, to have lower total expenses, so that is why I doubled instead of halved) and moved up to more optimistic total expense number (lower) or revenue (higher) as long as it is the same proportion if that makes any sense. I think it will make more sense and before we get into it realize this formula if you do not already know (Net income) - (Preferred dividends) = (Net proceeds) Divided by (Shares Outstanding) = Basic EPS

and if the format looks weird it is because it is originally in google doc form but I copy and pasted it here

**PRESENTING ALL MY EVIDENCE AND SITES THAT I USED FOR ALL OF THIS AFTER GOING OVER ESTIMATES. I WILL LINK ALL WEBSITES AND INFO USED TO CALCULATE MY ESTIMATES IN DESCRIPTION AND PIN IT IN THE COMMENTS.**

**EPS ESTIMATE BY WALL ST. ANALYSTS IS $-0.07**

Net income = profit of business after deducting expenses

IF \_\_\_\_ IS NOT TRUE THEN MY ESTIMATES WILL 100% BE WAY OFF

**EVEN WITH ALL THIS SAID I DO NOT THINK I AM BEING OVERLY OR UNFAIRLY OPTIMISTIC IN ANY TIER RELATIVE TO THE LABEL (unfairly bearish, conservative, fair, optimistic, unfairly bullish)**

**5 estimates**

ONE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO ) UNFAIRLY BEARISH ESTIMATE)

$-15M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-15M (Net proceeds)

$-15M Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0979176186 or -10 cents

(MISSES EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.03)

(MISSES Q3 2020 BY $0.01)

(BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.17)

% CHANCE IMO -- 2%

TWO

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO)CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE)

$-7.9M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-7.9M (Net proceeds) $-7.9M Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0515699458 or -5 cents

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $.02)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $0.04)

BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.22)

% CHANCE IMO -- 10%

THREE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO)FAIR ESTIMATE)

$-5M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-5M (Net proceeds) $-5M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0326392062 or -3 cents

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.04)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $0.06)

(BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.24)

% CHANCE IMO -- 25%

FOUR

((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATE)

$-3M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-3M (Net proceeds) $-3M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $-0.0195835237 or -2 cents

(BEATS EPS ($-0.07) ESTIMATE BY $0.05)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $0.07)

(BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.25)

% CHANCE IMO -- 50%

FIVE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO) UNFAIRLY BULLISH ESTIMATE)

$2m (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $2M (Net proceeds) $2M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $0.0130556825 OR 1 Cent

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.08)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $.10)

BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.28)

% CHANCE IMO -- 13%

2019 Q4 EPS was $-0.27

2020 Q3 was $-0.09

VERY likely that BNGO has doubled revenue in Q4. This means that -

Net income = profit of business after deducting expenses

There is no way of knowing BNGO’s Net income in Q4 but looking historically at net income increases and movements and looking at yahoo finance’s TTM total expenses stat, I am assuming that it has not risen more than 5-20% (I am comparing to ¼ of 2019 total expenses according to yahoo finance)

2020 Q3 net income -$10.8M

Shares outstanding for 2020 Q4 is $153.19M

Net income - Preferred dividends = Net Proceeds/Shares Outstanding = EPS

Important factors I considered when estimating net incomes for each tier - Acquisition of Lineagen (was acquired August 24th 2020), Earnings date was not delayed, Big money has not been selling out (to our knowledge (retail investors information)) prior to earnings, **EVEN WITH ALL THIS SAID I DO NOT THINK I AM BEING OVERLY OR UNFAIRLY OPTIMISTIC IN ANY TIER RELATIVE TO THE LABEL (unfairly bearish, conservative, fair, optimistic, unfairly bullish**

**5 estimates**

**Likely Scenarios for each tier!!!**

REMEMBER I CAN BE WRONG ON ALL OF THIS, I could be looking too closely into something or missing something

I could have math miscalculations or missed data or false data

m9nswl,gro2g8k,StockMarket,comment,1616300105,"So there is something called dividends in investing. Dividends are where the company pays you in cash (or more shares) for owning shares if it’s company. You should buy some shares in a really strong company and set up a dividend reinvestment program. This is so your cash payments are delivered in more stock of the company. This way you accumulate more and more shares until each dividend payout from just owning the shares will be huge because you own a lot of shares. Then you can hold onto those shares for the rest of your life and get a hefty check from the company every 4 months for the rest of your life.

Btw not trying to talk down to you if you know this already. I just don’t know how experienced you are and I wanted to offer some advice.",

Keep in mind that most of the time good things do not last. I have lost 8k+ by thinking “oh I will wait for this to hit the top. I don’t want to miss out on this insane gain.” There are 10s if thousands of people looking to profit on the same thing we are. A gain isn’t a gain and a loss isn’t a loss until you sell. I have benefitted off of diversifying my portfolio, namely with crypto. I do not put all of my eggs in one basket.

ma3co0,,StockMarket,post,1616352983,"DD Valuation of the Next Tesla: Grossly Undervalued bubble stock in the making (VOW, VWAGY)I'll split this DD valuation on Volkswagen into two parts: the Value Play and the Next Tesla Play.

VOW is the actual European stock ticker.  VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.

[Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales for 2020 and [Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/this-is-how-long-it-takes-to-become-an-ev-player-51616075163).

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020 for a [gross margin of 11.5%](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1).  As of March 19, its price-to-sales multiple is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60, despite not having the latter's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.  Their respective gross margins were [16.4%](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) and [4.6%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results).  They trade at similar price-to-sales multiples despite lacking Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues in 2020 €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, *should have already been worth at least €111.0 billion last year*.  [Deutsche Bank has recently stated that this particular business should already be worth €195.0 billion.](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/)  However, this is a conservative estimate, as the company has beaten its earlier EV unit sales targets, and again because EV are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles.

How much further should this EV-related market cap ""stonk""?

Well, [Volkswagen plans to sell 1 million EVs this very year!](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volkswagen-ev-goals-tesla-stock-51615901639)  If this is realistic, then the consumer EV sales could reach €23.95 billion.  Accordingly, the consumer EV business could be worth up to €479.1 billion.

**EV Economy Matters**

[The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, has big plans for fast charging and bidirectional charging.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/vw-plans-europe-s-biggest-battery-push-in-electric-offensive)

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $42 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should be €181.2 billion.

The EV top-up of €195.0 billion to €479.1 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €376.2 billion to €660.3 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been trading between $87.16 and $152.98 yesterday, folks!**

What really gets people is the stigma behind EVs. Tesla has the model 3 valued at around $32,000 which is very affordable if you consider that a 2020 Ford escape is $28 000 and I'm sure you could find a cost analysis of both vehicles and compare gas price/electric costs to fuel up both. I told my girlfriend when we get our house and I can afford it I'm getting solar panels, a tesla and the home charging kit and she called me crazy. The argument can be made that EVs will dominate the consumer market within 20 years, especially under the right administration.

If a stock has a large number of outstanding failure to delivers that haven’t been resolved, and then the stock undergoes a stock split, would the number of outstanding shares that need to be delivered also be split?

For example, company X has 200,000 shares marked as ‘Failed to Deliver’. The company then undergoes a 10:1 stock split. Will that mean that there are now 2,000,000 shares marked as “Failed to Deliver”? How would this affect the institutions who are failing to deliver these shares? Would it negatively affect the ability for whoever is in charge of locating these shares to actually discern which shares are counterfeit or missing, etc?",

&#x200B;

The thing is, there are probably trillions of FTD's. This shit has been going on for at least two decades(Check out Judd Bagely for some of his analysis on it). There are millions of people who own share that are fake and they have no clue. It's just like counterfeit dollars... except generally the government removes them from circulation when they are found. Here brokerages and DTCC has done squat to stop it.

&#x200B;

Chances are they will not mark them. If there is a 10:1 split and 200k FTD's then there will probably be 200k FTD's because those FTD's are floating around the system and moved around. If you bought 1 stock and it was FTD'ed you'd then be owed 10 after the split. That should generated 9 more FTD's. But you still don't actually have any stock! You get your IOU's and such but who's going to go solve this problem? Definitely not the people who created. Many people that made their billions cheating like this are already gone out of the market.

There simply is no telling how bad this problem is EXCEPT it seem extremely bad(go check out Judd's videos).

m9n6yc,grnxnb8,StockMarket,comment,1616297173,But this doesn’t actually mean anything. You can have shorts opened for good reason or because of arbitrage and pricing inefficiencies.,
m9n6yc,grobezo,StockMarket,comment,1616306410,Bro what? I shorted oil going into this drop cuz oil looked mad over bought to me. Now I sold and I am going long again. I’m sure people just came to the same realization,
m9lna2,,StockMarket,post,1616291541,"Webull is a Chinese company?A friend referred me to Webull to trade stocks. After a bit of googling I found out it is headquartered in New York but is **owned** by Fumi Technology, a Chinese holding **company** that has received backing from Xiaomi and other private equity investors in China. 

According to its website it is a member of SIPC, which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). Its clearing firm is Apex Clearing Corp has purchased an additional insurance policy. The coverage limits provide protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million, subject to maximum limits of $37.5 million for any one customer’s securities and $900,000 for any one customer’s cash.  

So with heightened Chinese/US tensions do people who use this have additional risk if relations further flame. Curious to any feedback as i'm new and want to be careful and i know a lot of other people are enjoying the service.",
m9lna2,grnpehm,StockMarket,comment,1616292338,"Also, isn’t it law in China that every Chinese company give China government full access to customer data? Isn’t that what the issue was with tiktok?",
m9lna2,grnssit,StockMarket,comment,1616294283,Yes they are a Chinese company.  Their contact page used to have a Chinese address.  Looks like the removed it.  I dont understand why so many retail investors like using apps like Webull and Robinhood so much.  Sure they UI is nice but why risk your money with these new companies when more reliable/established companies are out there?  I'd pick peace of mind and reliability over UI 100000%,

m96yzx,,StockMarket,post,1616246626,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
> The bond market’s reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell’s briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
> “This is bonds’ — I wouldn’t call it day in the sun — it’s more like day in the tornado,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “Clearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that’s not the case.”
*****
> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “The bond move has been huge, and it’s starting to scare people,” said Schumacher.
*****
> “There’s been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?” he asked. “There’s no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It’s incredible.”
*****
> # Powell speaks
*****
> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
> # Inflation and the Fed
> There is also some key data.
*****
> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank’s forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year’s numbers when prices fell.
*****
> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It’s a change to the Fed’s ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
> “For the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there’s a consensus problem. There can’t not be tension,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> “They will be trying to clarify the Fed’s message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,” she said. “They will be explaining themselves as economists, and they’ll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.”
*****
> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
> “The market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed’s dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,” said Grohowski.
*****
> “Yet, they’re committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,” he said. “That’s what the market is struggling with. I think it’s unsettling to me to hear words like ‘overshoot.’”
*****
> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‘great rotation’ from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
> “I think we’re in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It’s not over, but I think we’ve seen the lion’s share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,” said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed’s willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike’s comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
> “Inflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,” Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year’s earnings.”
*****
> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed’s economic forecast.
*****
> “If you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It’s too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,” Grohowski said.
*****
> # Bond market direction
> Schumacher said there’s a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

> # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One
*****
> “The stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.” Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard
*****
> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick’s Day! We’ve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here’s to some more today and over the rest of 2021.
*****
> One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ’29 crash, the ’87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn’t do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we’ve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we’ll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
> So what happens now is the logical question? “The good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although it won’t be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls’ side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.”
*****
> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
> “Global growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators” according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “When we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.”
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “The level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country’s below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country’s relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January’s 0.5% pace.
*****
> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI’s value.
*****
> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite’s growth, while manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-picture-3.19.21.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “In recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.”
*****
> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

I'm curious what others think because even if Microsoft doubles its value, I don't see it becoming a 5 or 10 bagger compared to where it's at right now. I know they also have dividends, but I don't own enough shares for that to matter much. So for people who have once owned MSFT, what was your reason for selling it? Likewise, for people who own a couple shares, why do you continue to hold it? Thanks in advance for the input.",['MSFT']
m9pwa4,groppuz,StockMarket,comment,1616319891,Microsoft is a buy and hold for life stock. Keep it as a base Investment for the future. Also Microsoft bought Bethesda and is doubling down on gaming. I think that is an interesting growth story that will pay off in the mid to long term.,['MSFT']
m9pwa4,grvbyao,StockMarket,comment,1616456186,"If you are a long term investor and you're trying to find the next 10 bagger, then I would shop around, because I agree that MSFT isn't growing as fast as other companies. I still think MSFT is a great long term company though, but it will get outperformed by other tech companies. 

If we just look at some of the large caps, we can find some better deals. Stocks like Facebook, AMD and Ubiquiti have better growth but similar valuations. Netflix, Amazon and Disney have double the growth, but have more expensive valuations relatively speaking. In my opinion the growth is worth the cost if you consider the PEG ratio of these companies. 

You can't go wrong with MSFT, but you can do better (it's all about opportunity cost). There is nothing wrong with trying to find the next Amazon or Facebook, but just make sure you are doing your due diligence.","['AMD', 'NFLX', 'FB', 'PEG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']"

I think to answer your question appropriately, we need more context. What are your top 5 holdings?  What are you considering swapping MSFT?  What is your risk tolerance and time horizon?

I could have cashed out my MSFT shares in 1999 and put it in Amazon (but I didn’t). I could have also put it in Pets.com (but I didn’t). There are companies today growing much faster than MSFT but many won’t be around in 10 years.","['MSFT', 'AMZN']"

m9dhhq,,StockMarket,post,1616266278,"Tracking investments.Hello there,

I am somewhat new to the stock market and investing. Please, be kind. I am trying to learn as much as I can. 

So about 2 months ago, after hearing about the Robinhood app and the WSB shenanigans with GME, I decided to look into stock exchange apps/websites. At the moment, Robinhood seemed like the most user-friendly one, to begin with. I signed up and waited about a month to be approved. 

Since then, I have put in about $500 towards stocks and crypto. Along the way, I did more research and realized that Robinhood isn't the greatest place to be for cryptocurrency. I stopped putting money there and am now using Voyager for certain cryptos. Nonetheless, my stocks are still there. 

I decided to open an account with Fidelity as well. My plan is to transfer my stocks from Robinhood to Fidelity. I am aware of the $75 fee for transferring things over. Nonetheless, I will have some stocks in Robinhood that I don't want to move (free one that I got that is useless) and I don't want to sell because of taxes (I also did some small purchases $1-$5 investments to see how stocks worked prior to investing the bigger bucks).  I want to keep my Fidelity for the serious long-term stocks & EFT's... and leave the risky/new stocks on Robinhood. 

Additionally, I have a 401k(through work) and an IRA (NEW, also with Fidelity). Keeping track of all of these different things through different websites seems kind of overwhelming at times. 

What would you guys recommend in order to track all your investments?

If you are mostly buying a few positions and holding long term, then any method is pretty straightforward. If you are consistently adding to positions, or trading regularly, then it probably comes down to whatever method is easiest for you to input every position change.

Like GME being a cyclical stock, with a multi-year downturn and a multi-year shitstorm, MOMO has had almost 2 full years of bad news. So the sentiment is of course at the bottom and there are catalysts needed to re-price the stock towards the upside potential. The good thing is, the downside is limited due to solid fundamentals.

Also rating agencies add their 2 cents on the stock here and there. The latest downgrade came from Morgan Stanley. Well, those ""experts"" increased their position by 42% at the end of last year and now talk about a price traget of $15:

[NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/c0rn2bbl85o61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=770e0d0be1bdd32342d6b1fb9b3149aa730e6436)

So I don't know what they intend or if their price target follows any agenda, but I think their price target is not right. Their arguments are:

* weaker than expected recovery after the strategic reform and outlook in 2021, potential regulatory risk, and recent rebound in valuation;
* we see a weak 2021 outlook;
* higher revenue sharing ratios for the new contractual incentive programs for golden broadcasters, and some VAS use cases.

Well then why the heck do you load up shares massively in the first place. And these are basically abstract, universal bullshit risks that every company has to face. Like me saying, I wouldn't buy Amazon stock because anti monopoly regulations could split the company, logistic comapnies have raised their prices and Covid will leave people unemployed and broke and nobody buys anything. Universal risks, not false.

On the other hand, they price $BMBL in at $56 implying a $6.5bn valuation, which in my opinion is madness regarding a revenue of not even $500m compared to $MOMO of $2.3bn, basically saying that the company is worth only $3bn.

[FINVIZ](https://preview.redd.it/quesq4jr85o61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=1204e91701714572058c92208d01ca5cf0818e85)

The guy from Morgan Stanley seems to be a Chinese dude at the company and he gave the price target. If you want to know how young Chinese guys value the apps, look at the video Nian Li posted about MOMO on YouTube!

As I said in my previous article, I assume a fair value of the stock of $25-$40. Let me try to test that statement based on additional facts.

**Balance Sheet**

Let's look at the balance sheet as well, this one I did not cover last time. The company has virtually $1.7bn on hands, and (as far as I am concerned) Tantan is on the books for price/goodwill of $735m. Other Long term assets are there with another $705m. All in all you have $3.3bn in assets that are basically cash or can be sold.

Total debt/liabilities of the company is $1.25bn, leaving the equity position at $2.1bn.

If you value a company like this at 1.6 x Equity (current market cap of $3.5bn), you definitely leave out massive potential of the calculation.

Let's say you take over the company, what would you pay for, what would you deduct if you owned the company? I would see:

* Cash on hands
* Assets (Tantan and Momo users)
* Liabilities

Cash on hands is cash on hands is cash on hands: $1.7bn

I would still value each user between $10-$15 bucks: $4.7-$7.1bn

Liabilities is liabilities: $1.25bn

This leaves me at $5.15-7.55bn for 100% of the shares thereabouts, if I could buy and liquidate the company. The leaves me at $25-$37 a share, so I guess the more refined approach makes my first estimate looks pretty damn solid. And it's not going to get more complicated than that!!

Here I am not talking about subjective discounts or premiums on country or political risks, but merely numbers I can cross examine and that make sense to me.

**Other risks**

If you think China is a bad country and the companies and the party there are bad and fraudulent, okay, you can price that in. But to me $MOMO is too simple a company and why would they make up anything.

1. Founder is still heavily invested.
2. The company is pretty conservative and cash producing.
3. Their earnings calls sound true to me.

The company sees that MOMO App has matured and accepts that as fact. So the revenue plateau here is recognized as such and they try to apply new functions there, by saving cash and reinvest.

In the Q3 earnings call they are very open about the fact that MOMO has matured, they have plenty of cash, they are ""prudent"" in M&A activities, etc. What I mean is, those guys seem to be relaxed and in no hurry. If you make shit up, you try to always beat the numbers and try to smokebomb everyone and doing shady shit behind the screen.

They are crysrtal clear also about the fact that Q4 might still be subject to restructuring, optimizing, weak growth, etc. They sound sincere and act like business owners, like ""we need to chill out, save our cash and see how we can grow again from here."" Unlike overpaid coke-nosed-boomer CEOs they take a break and see. Long-term oriented. And of course they want to make money, why do you think they started the whole thing years ago!! Speaking of which...

**Valuation 5 years ago**

Read this article from JUNE 23, 2015 : [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-momo-inc-m-a-yan-tang/chinese-chat-app-momo-gets-buyout-offer-from-ceo-idUSKBN0P31K920150623?edition-redirect=in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-momo-inc-m-a-yan-tang/chinese-chat-app-momo-gets-buyout-offer-from-ceo-idUSKBN0P31K920150623?edition-redirect=in)

""\[bla bla bla\] The offer values the company at $3.6 billion.""

That was 2015!!! MOMO anounced its purchase of Tantan on FEB 23, 2018: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/china-s-momo-to-acquire-smaller-tinder-like-rival-app-tantan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/china-s-momo-to-acquire-smaller-tinder-like-rival-app-tantan)

Tantan was valued at $735m in 2018 and is still on the books at that price. Value that asset with todays prices. Tantan in 2018 had 95m active users. Bumble? Let's see:

[BUSINESSOFAPPS](https://preview.redd.it/ceg3lo1e95o61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c49ceafc954d29a3bba2d466dd5714c206906f7)

So either is Bumble only worth $735m like Tantan or Tantan is worth $7.6bn like bumble. Or it's somewhere in the middle and I am right.

**Conclusion**

So anyway. I still think

* MOMO is significantly undervalued,
* Morgan Stanley should pay me money for doing their homework,
* BUMBLE is a hype stock!

Have a nice weekend everybody!!

m8q2t6,,StockMarket,post,1616185167,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dropped after China reportedly banned some state and military personnel from using the company's vehicles over national security concerns, according to reports from outlets including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.
* The [U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-to-restore-bank-capital-requirements-as-treasury-markets-130935328.html) that it will not extend a temporary bank leverage ratio exemption past its March 31 expiration date. Leverage ratio put simply, is a regulation that restricts how much money a bank can lend relative to how much capital the bank devotes to its own assets.

maxt80,,wallstreetbets,post,1616446716,"GME: Poker, cannibalism, and why the apes are going to win this hand.I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Listen up, apes.  I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen.  Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it.  Now, I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal, or really anything with meaningful content, so let's just talk about card games.

How do casinos make money on poker?  For each hand of poker played, the casino takes a small percentage of the pot, which is called the rake.  The casino provides the establishment and the dealers, the players play, and the casino takes its commission.  Okay, great, but what the fuck does this have to do with GME?  We're getting there.  Hang on.  The edging is real, but you'll get your payoff.

So the casino takes its cut from each pot.  The more money in the pot, the more money the casino makes.  Great.  How do they maximize profits?  Well, they can bring in more players, get players to play longer, deal more hands per hour, and/or increase the average size of the pots.  I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these, because it doesn't matter.  What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains.  The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money, you just need to understand their business model.

Let's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots.  There are tons of ways to do this, but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino, you're at a local back-alley gambling spot.   Their operation isn't super sophisticated.  They just install a few of their cronys into each game.  Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals: bring people in, loosen up the tables, and create big pots.   As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table (and lose it), the house will profit.

There's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet.  No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money, right?  Well, that's not entirely true.  In fact, it's not at all true.  Then why the fuck did I mention it?  Well, you tell me, why the fuck would you play a rigged game?

Even if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham, if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth, they will still play.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  In fact, it's even a good thing for the house when ""dumb money"" make money; this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends.  They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently.

The house wants you to play.  The house wants your friends to play.  The house wants everyone to play.  So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play?  Did you fucking read the last paragraph?  It's simple: you make it the best way for anyone to make money.  You essentially force them to play.  Don't get lost in the details.   It doesn't matter how this is accomplished.  They can lick you, suck you, fuck you, beat you, squeeze you, whack the other competition off, etc.  All that matters is that whatever game they run, it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery.

So what happens when players make too much money?  I don't know, what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code?  What happens when the sheep start misbehaving?  A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep, but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame.  Again, the game is rigged, and  the minions have one fucking job: follow the script and don't get too greedy.  Any problem, and I mean any problem, is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood.  

Reddit is an enormous echo chamber.  Shit gets loud in here, but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME, most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big, they're not going to care.  They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery.

So what the hell am I actually saying about GME?  The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused, but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand.  There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some ""Epsteins,"" but as long as the apes don't fold, the apes win this round.  If the mobsters play this game right, they'll fold this hand, take their losses, and (as usual) end up winning in the long run.  They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff.  This is EZ mode.

Do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine?  It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family, a bigly minion, or even the fucking godfather.  You live by the sword, you die by the sword.  When you have an infected limb, you first try to treat it, but if that doesn't work, you cut that shit off.  These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own--I'm sure that some of them even prefer it.  The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder, and the cannibals are going to feast.

TL;DR Read the fucking post.  It took me way longer to write than it will take (most of) you to read it.

What you described about players working for the house that play that actually exsist, there called poker props. If there's not enough players for a table and they need more players they can send in a poker prop to keep the game going. As far as if a casino had more wins than normally you'd run into a liquidity problem very fast, a casino is required to keep a certain amount on hand but how they cycle money eventually it all ends up in the machines tied up, until the drop team comes in to free up there money.",

mb72z0,,wallstreetbets,post,1616475590,"FINRA Reporting Inaccurate Total Trade VolumeI used Fintel to gauge the short interest of any given stock because I thought they were reliable. However, with the latest round of orchestrated ""flash crashes"" being done on meme stocks, and Fintel actually reporting lower ""Short Volume Ratio"" afterwards, I set out to find out just what the hell is going on.

Turns out, Fintel gets their Short Volume figure from FINRA's [Daily Short Sale Volume Files](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). Through that webpage, you can find short volume data for any stock for any given day. For example, today 2021-03-22, FINRA maintains that GME had a **short volume of 2,358,752** with a **total volume of 3,843,634**. And according to FINRA, Total Volume is defined as ""**share volume of all executed trades during regular trading hours**.""

&#x200B;

[FINRA Daily Short Sale Volume File Format Legend](https://preview.redd.it/l45d11be6po61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4298fe454531bedf29690f7db0bb901785a0c3)

Alright, that's cool and all but what is wrong? Well, the problem is the Total Volume figure reported by FINRA is completely off and the fact that services like Fintel uses FINRA's short volume data to calculate short volume ratio presents inaccurate data to the public.

For example, Fintel is currently reporting a **23%** Short Volume Ratio for GME as of 2021-03-22. The way they calculate Short Volume Ratio is simply take the Short Volume figure from FINRA (**2,358,752**) divided by the Total Volume. Whao, but Fintel is showing **10,054,700** as the Total Volume for GME, what?

[Fintel uses the Short Volume figure from FINRA. Example: 2021-03-22, Short Volume for GME: 2,358,752. However, Fintel disagrees with FINRA in that Fintel uses 10,054,700 as the total volume whereas FINRA maintains GME only had 3,843,634 total volume.](https://preview.redd.it/5g4lhepc7po61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f5c94c82d5a01181d73667ebeeb7feed416e25e)

Okay, let see then..

[ Yahoo Finance shows GME had a volume of 9,573,686 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/m3483d888po61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=401ab28bc0b80a29c43d0ec4d358566bb035dae3)

[ Fidelity shows GME had a volume of 10,061,505 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/nrkys7cv8po61.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee32b3251553ab514d1835f9fa0b540e5d9bb27)

You get the picture. Four sources confirmed that GME had a total volume of \~10M on 2021-03-22. Why the hell is FINRA reporting only 3.8M as the total volume? YES, I am aware that FINRA breaks down their report by markets. I specifically did the analysis based on their ""consolidated"" data across markets B *(NASDAQ TRF Chicago)*, Q *(NASDAQ TRF Carteret)* and N *(NYSE TRF)* So, what the hell?

Once I start questioning that, I had to check FINRA's short volume report for a longer time span for GME. Turns out, FINRA has been under-reporting total volume for all tickers since.. ever. Here I compare what FINRA is reporting vs what Yahoo and Fidelity are reporting. (Blue: FINRA, Red: Yahoo and Yellow: Fidelity)

[ GME Total Trading Volume as reported by FINRA, Yahoo & Fidelity \(2021-01-01 to 2021-03-22\) \[Check sources below raw data\]](https://preview.redd.it/wj18e4vpcpo61.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf1121443100b84f7e78e92b7c9c9ceafe96f44)

As you can see, Yahoo and Fidelity pretty much align 100% on what the total volume is, but FINRA ***\_never\_*** reported even remotely close to what others are reporting. Again, keep in mind the FINRA data I used in this analysis is consolidated across markets.

The ramification of using FINRA's short volume and the total volume of what everyone else is reporting is underestimating the short volume ratio. If we go by the total volume reported by FINRA, we actually get 2358752 / 3843634= **61.4%** Short Volume Ratio. However, sites like Fintel uses that 2358752 short volume figure and the total volume \~10M figure, that gives a low **23%** Short Volume Ratio. The difference is dramatic.

**The questions that need to be answered are: what is FINRA reporting? Why do the total volume they report so different than everybody else's? How confident and reliable are their Short Volume data then? If their consolidated data turns out to be not consolidated, are they deceiving the public in that services like Fintel report a fraction of the real Short Volume Ratio as a result?**

For the record, I did check other stocks *(blue chips, meme stocks, EV.. etc.)* FINRA ***\_always\_*** under-report the total volume.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: FINRA allegedly report inaccurate total volume in their Short Sale Volume daily report and services like Fintel uses them and as a result gives inaccurate short volume ratio.

Special thanks to amcstock Discord for helping the research.

As discussed below, the data: (1) does not include any trades that are not publicly disseminated, (2) is not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does not—and is not intended to—equate to short interest position information.” https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)

# TL;DR

Think like a customer. Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.

Walk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?

When you’ve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.

# Purpose

Disclaimer: Don’t use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!

Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**  

* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**  

* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**  

* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**  

* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**  

* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**  

* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**  

* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# First Phase: Real Estate

Walk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?

https://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8

Ultimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf

The reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.

&#x200B;

# Second Phase: Customer Service

You as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey’s targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.

https://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6

Ask yourself:

\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?

\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?

\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?

– Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?

\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?

\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?

&#x200B;

# Summary

Despite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the “custom” in customer.

mb585a,grwc6u1,wallstreetbets,comment,1616476700,"I recently shopped at gamestop, went in there with a blank slate and I am not much of a gamer. 

What I love:

. Staff knew what they were talking about when it came 
to games

. Customer Service was excellent and I felt that I was treated right

. They had clothing that I was really tempted to buy because it looked cool and it was cheap

What they can improve upon:

. Store looks old. I saw the leak of the new gamestop and it looks alot better. 

. They should have a Amazon-like lockers for pickups. Use the app to provide the a code to open up the locker. I say this because I want to get in and out of the store

. Have staff use tablets with credit card reader to help customers whom wait in line

The idea is to make the customer to have a frictionless experience and waiting in line sucks. Imagine that during a major release. That being said, I expected to spend 20 dollars in the store, but I ended up spending 80. Got myself the new Monster Hunter:Rise and the pro membership.",['AMZN']

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

I'm sure a lot of you have seen me post most of this in the daily threads, but it would be nice to get this some real visibility ahead of Tuesday:

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last 2 big news catalysts?

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

**Price Action following these news catalysts:**

[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

Here's how closing price trended around these two announcements:

2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**

2/24 - Close: $91.71

2/25 - Close: $108.73

2/26 - Close: $101.74

3/11 - Close: $260.00

3/12 - Close: $264.5


As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.

**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

**Editing to include some new info I dug up regarding the board members who will not be standing for re-election at the next board meeting.

I'll briefly touch on some financial aspects (will try to include as little technicalities as possible - we won't be making our own DCF/EVA/Multiple Valuation, calculating a WACC and levering and de-levering betas here but there'll be some numbers - soz).

Mainly I want to touch on the misconception that Palantir is not profitable and that they're losing more and more money year by year. I'll try to show why Aunt Cathie, Vanguard and Soros Fund Management aren't actually high.

>*ThEy'Ve BeEn ArOuNd FoR 17 YeArS aNd ArE sTiLl NoT pRoFiTaBlE*

Buckle up boomer.

Before we get to that I want to briefly discuss the current market environment and the potential for further dips (potentially even dips of dips of dips a.k.a. megadips) in the near future as to inform some of you newer YOLOers about what this whole 10 YR Treasury Yield shit is all about and why you should care. It might potentially save you some money. If you're familiar with the inverse correlation of growth stock prices and the treasury yields/inflation expectations, just skip ahead.

At the end I'd like to compare PLTR's current situation with industry peers and compare their forecasted developments.

# Valuation of Growth Stocks & 10 YR Treasury Yield

Now why is Palantir dipping more than other tech stocks like Apple or Google? Was it just a pump and dump? Are people leaving? To answer that question we'll have to look at how people valuate companies. The most widely used method is the Discounted Cash Flow method. In simplified terms you look at a company's future cash flows, discount them at some interest rate, add some fancy terminal value and what not (don't worry about that) and you end up with the current company's valuation.

[This is a simplified version of the DCF valuation - you can get all fancy with this](https://preview.redd.it/vkpao2965no61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=1888f4c171b6a8dea8bd03574556e9c7d8299d39)

Now when treasury rates rise - the discount rate (r) rises - your Cashflow gets smaller. The further out in the future your cashflows are - the more you're affected by rising interest rates. Hence why companies with valuations based on cashflows that are far out are more strongly affected by those rising rates. The big Cash Flows are a few years out and are being discounted at (1+r) \^ many years.

Below you'll see how MSFT, GOOGL & AAPL's market caps are a lot less affected than newer companies such as Tesla (moderately new), PLTR and Snowflake - they're all ""tech"" stocks but tech  **≠** same growth expectations for all tech companies.

[Inverse Correlation between Growth Stocks & Treasury Yields](https://preview.redd.it/kzn6lnyd7no61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f12416a459f10e1c0751111d9d1172835e38d2)

**TLDR**: If treasury yields continue to rise we might see growth stock prices go even lower due to people valuating these stocks at a lower price due to the increasing discount rate (r). That's just a little disclaimer I wanted to get out of the way - the macroeconomic environment matters a whole lot for these stocks.

Now let's get to the sawwssee

# PLTR Revenue Expectations vs. Peers

Some numbers incoming - bear with me it'll get better.

So this one's pretty straightforward. Palantir increased their revenues by 47% between FY 2019 and FY 2020. The revenues from government operations in 2018 accounted for 43% (255m $) of total revenues, commercial revenue accounted for 57% (340m $) - In 2020 Government revenues accounted for 56% (610m $), commercial revenues accounted for 44% (482.5m $) of total revenues.

So many numbers I know - hold on. Between 2018 and 2020 had a roughly 150% increase in government revenues and respectively roughly 40% increase in commercial revenues. Now the good news - we're not even close to being done yet.

So [Palantir state](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-47-for-Full-Year-2020-Expects-Q1-2021-Revenue-Growth-of-45) that they're expecting **AT LEAST** 30% YoY growth in FY 2021 and I don't expect Papa Karp to underdeliver. Analysts predict a 40% increase. Now what's even more interesting is that actual profit metrics (EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income) are expected to grow from roughly 50% - 70% respectively - Palantir is going to be profitable very soon (they actually already are - or close to being profitable at least, but more on that later).

[Analyst Forecasts for profitability \/ growth metrics](https://preview.redd.it/5zrjp184hno61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=40a8ac792091fabc1437d07b71a1111321edbf01)

Now you might say ""the price targets are completely off - why trust these analysts when it comes to financial forecasts"" - truth be told, the forecasts on KPIs were a lot more accurate than the PTs. Although they were off by a mile on some of the KPIs (predicted a Net Income of 124 when it was actually 197, I've noticed that analysts have always underestimated those metrics with Palantir - so the following figures might actually end up being a low-ball estimate/bear case) - the mean prediction of revenues was 1072 vs. 1093 actual revenues, so that's pretty accurate.

[Pretty accurate mean revenue estimate - GJ](https://preview.redd.it/vlbdhrnqrno61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a26d86c0ceb917476c0f6a9c760bfa32d688915)

Okay - now to Palantir's profitability. I want to dismiss the following kind of comments and have you apes understand why PLTR is Soros Fund Management LLC's 2nd largest position, why it accounts for 21% of Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC's portfolio, why Vanguard is literally just telling Papa Karp to take their money, why Aunt Cathie is all over this stock.

[Stock based compensation 5xed in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 - that's what happens when you IPO](https://preview.redd.it/06msu3oukno61.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0354cc01aa4b5ec4baad220cc0cb7d61aa6177b)

So look at Datadog, Snowflake, Dynatrace, they all IPO'd in 2020 (Dynatrace IPO'd in 2019). You see how the stock based compensation accounts for a huge chunk of their net loss (Datadog's Stock Price Compensation was 74M$ vs. 24.5M$ net loss - substract that from the net loss and they're actually up 50M$)? That's not the case for mature companies like Adobe -  why's that? u/ugh_stupidpeople explains that pretty nicely [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/ll646o/stock_based_compensation/gnnm3fx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The gist is that employees get a a percentage of their salaries payed out as shares, when they IPO the following happens (in the PLTR case):

>The higher PLTR's stock price goes, the more its stock-based compensation numbers reported in earnings will increase, until pre-IPO compensation agreements expire. That's because the quantity of shares they're paying their employees was fixed pre-IPO. Higher price x same # of shares = higher cost reported. This will end as those pre-IPO compensation agreements expire.  
>  
>If Palantir's stock hadn't tripled since going public, their stock-based comp numbers would be much lower.  
>  
>\- u/ugh_stupidpeople

All else staying constant - if Palantir had the same Stock Based Compensation as they reported 2019 a.k.a. if they hadn't IPOed - they'd have an adjusted net loss of around 140 mio as opposed to the reported 1.166B$. If you deduct the 241m $ from the reported net loss of 579m $ (= 338m $), the adj. net loss would've been half that, in other words their net income would've increased by 50% not decreased by 100%.

>""BuT YoU'rE JuSt TwIsTiNg ThE NuMbeRs To MaKe It LoOk GoOd""

If that's what you're thinking right now, ask yourself if that ""expense"" actually reflects the companies' operational profitability - did it destroy value in any way, is the increasing net loss attributable to bad leadership and a shitty product? It's clearly not. It's just screwing us - the shareholders over in the short run - employees have gotten a disproportionate amount of shares (could Papa Karp have expected the share price to 4x - high of 38$ - or even 3x - current levels - from its IPO valuation in a matter of weeks? Doubt). Those employees are dumping those shares at every fucking spike.

I suspect that's one of the reasons behind Papa Karp's infamous quote ""Fuck off if you're here for the short term gains - we'll be dumping our shares because we're tired of eating ramen every fucking night"".

Remember how the price sky-rocketed to 40ish $ and came crashing down back to the 20s - a big part of that was the lock-in expiring a.k.a. employees cashing in at the top (They actually bought low and sold high, not like some of you apes). This all ends in max. 5 years - the dumping will be a lot less significant though as time goes by - when the pre-IPO Stock Based Compensations will have expired and the employees will be getting a less disproportionate amount of shares in relation to the current market price.

Now the good news is: These stock based compensations are expected to half by next year (see picture above), the profitability margins are expected to rise and the overall numbers are expected to grow - Palantir should be reporting around 320m $ + Net Income and in 5 years those pre-IPO stock compensation agreements will all have expired.

# Some blabber about CoGs, scalability and R&D expenditures (based on 3rd picture - Analyst Forecasts, I'm not gonna label the figures with Fig. 1 etc., we're still just on Reddit)

The CoGs (Cost of Goods Sold) are expected to stay more or less constant - that's in line with what Papa Karp always said. Palantir's services/products are organised in a way that they can be deployed to more customers without having to spend an amount proportionate to their revenue growth - don't ask me how, I'm not a fucking engineer, check the DD I linked at the bottom of the post if you're into those technicalities. Same goes for companies like Amazon AWS - double the amount of customers, get another server and maybe hire 10% more employees (I don't know the exact figures, as I said, I'm not a fucking engineer but you get the point).

R&D expenditures will grow by 40% and 20% in FY 2021 and FY 2022 respectively - I like to see that, that means they're investing to create a more competitive product. Consider they've had a pretty hostile relationship with IBM until IBM eventually gave up and partnered with PLTR - now imagine those Apollo/Foundry/Gotham testicles growing even larger.

# Peer Analysis

Now this all sounds pretty nice, is Palantir just giga special, one of a kind? No - the data analytics/data management - basically everything that has to do with data industry is growing like there's no tomorrow. Here a few quotes to highlight that (actual scientific literature - I know my brain hurts too, we're done soon):

>The size of the digital universe was roughly 130 billion gigabytes in 1995. By 2020, this number will swell to 40 trillion gigabytes.  
>  
>\- Professor Murtaza Haider (Professor of Data Science)

&#x200B;

>By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions  
>  
>\- McKinsey Global Institute

Okay, so there'll be exponentially more data year by year, we can gain insights from that data to improve our business decisions and save a literal fuck ton of money by doing so. Airbus for example claims that they've managed to speed up their A350 production process by 33% just by using PLTR's services. Now that's deep fucking value - not u/DeepFuckingValue deep fucking value I mean actual deep fucking value - literal millions/billions saved.

[So here are the forecasted Revenue Growths for PLTR's industry peers](https://preview.redd.it/f229ofiqvno61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dac321953bfd0559e3249df594f81cd2dcfb466)

Now see, when Papa Karp says 30% annual growth and Jefferie's says 40% annual growth - they're not actually high, that industry is just growing at an abnormal pace. By the end of FY 2023 PLTR's revenues (according to analyst estimates and assuming Papa Karp's 30% YoY growth) will have increased by 127% - crazy right? Well - Snowflake's projected to grow by 388% (although I'm a bit skeptical about that one). So on a Peer Median (92.3%) Palantir's 127% revenue growth doesn't actually sound too absurd (Snowflake 388% on the other hand - not sure).

Let's talk about the current valuation based on the Price to Sales Ratio - Consider the recently IPO'd companies (Datadog, DynaTrace, Palantir and Snowflake) - forget about SolarWinds for a second.

They all have P/S Ratios between 21 and 105 (Snowflake lul). My point being: PLTR is not grossly overvalued, they'll grow into that valuation. If all goes according to plan and assuming the market cap stays constant, which obv it won't - PLTR will have a P/S Ratio of under 20 with the current valuation. Close to Adobe with a P/S ratio of 16.85.

*SolarWinds is at a P/S ratio of 5, that's partly due to them being hacked which pretty much a.) fucked their growth in FY 2020 and for the following years and b.) people dumping their stock after the hacks were medialised (Share price of 25$ on December 11th - down to 14$ December 18th).*

To get back to the profitability part real quick, after that you're dismissed - Datadog, Dynatrace and Snowflake - the new kids on the block - all reported a negative Net Income for 2020 and they've all been around for at least a decade. (Snowflake founded 2012 - soz) Amazon was founded 1994 and had their first \*reported\* profitable year in 2004 - a decade later, that's just how it goes in the software/digital services world apparently.

**TLDR**: So all that being said - Whilst PLTR is getting a lot of attention in the medias and on various other platforms including this subreddit - I personally do not think that PLTR is grossly overvalued. There's some asset inflation due to macroeconomic factors but considering how hot of a topic of discussion PLTR is right now (as compared to Datadog for example), it surprised me that they're not at a higher P/S (example Snowflake P/S 100). Their growth potential is huge but not irrealistic, it seems like they have the scalability figured out. I'm hyped for Demo Day on the 14th of April - although I don't understand half of what those nerds are saying when they start talking about their technical shenanigans.

The argument that they've been in the business for 2 decades and are too retarded to make a profit is something someone would say who never pulled up any of their filings - they're just regurgitating some stupid shit they heard somewhere (perhaps out of Cramer's ass or smth) in the hopes that they'll sound smart.

I'll post it again - I really liked u/ada_diamonds take [Former PLTR Engineer DD Part #2: Usability, Deployabilty, Scalability, & Submersibility + My Lockup Plan : PLTR (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lknie3/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/) \- I can't tell you why PLTR is different from the other suppliers like he can (Predictive analytics, incomplete datasets something something) so go check that DD out if you haven't already. He also highlights where that future growth will potentially be coming from - more of a qualitative approach which I'm trying to support with some quants.

I like seeing people make those sweet sweet gains and tendies galore. So I decided to make this post to help you autists sharpen your crayons and actually use them for a greater purpose than just as snacks to eat in between buying calls on whatever stock is hot for the day.

Elliot Waves are a theory that markets move in stages of a theoretical ""2 steps forward, one step back"" type movement (in this case 5 advances with 3 pullbacks, usually followed by 2 declines with 1 advance). They were first observed and described in the mid 1900's. For more background info, and a full description of Elliot waves, their history and uses, and applications, I would advise everyone to read ""Elliot wave Principles: Key to market behaviour"" by A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter. You can access this for free at [https://z-lib.org/](https://z-lib.org/)

&#x200B;

This post will outline a summary of Rules and Guidelines for Elliot Waves:

**Motive Waves**

*Impulse:*

Rules:

* An impulse wave always subdivides into 5 waves
* Wave 1 always subdivides into an impulse or (rarely) a diagonal
* Wave 3 always subdivides into an impulse
* Wave 5 always divides into an impulse or diagonal
* Wave 2 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat or combination
* Wave 4 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat, triangle or combination
* Wave 2 never moves beyond the start of wave 1
* Wave 3 always moves beyond the end of wave 1
* Wave 3 is never the shortest wave
* Wave 4 never moves beyond the end of wave 1
* Never are waves 1, 3 and 5 all extended

Guidelines:

* Wave 4 will almost always be a different corrective pattern than wave 2
* Wave 2 is usually a zigzag or zigzag combination
* Wave 4 is usually a flat, triangle or flat combination
* Sometimes wave 5 does not move beyond the end of wave 3 (in which case it is called a truncation)
* Wave 5 often ends when meeting or slightly exceeding a line drawn from the end of wave 3 that is parallel to the line connecting the ends of waves 2 and 4
* The centre of wave 3 almost always has the steepest slope of any equal period within the parent impulse except that sometimes an early portion of wave 1 (the kickoff) will be steeper
* Wave 1, 3, or 5 is usually extended (an extension appears ""stretched"" because its corrective waves are small compared to its impulse waves. It is substantially longer and contains larger sub-divisions than the non-extended waves
* Often the extended subwave is the same number (1, 3 or 5) as the parent wave
* Rarely do two subwaves extend, although it is typical for waves 3 and 5 both to extend when they are of Cycle or Supercycle degree and within a fifth wave of one degree higher
* Wave 1 is the least commonly extended wave
* When wave 3 is extended, waves 1 and 5 tend to have gains related by equality or the Fibonnaci ratio
* When wave 5 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 1through 3
* When wave 1 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 3 through 5
* Wave 4 typically ends when it is within the price range of subwave four of 3
* Wave 4 often subdivides the entire impulse into Fibonnaci proportions in time and/or price

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/mb100z/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I have literally spent my entire day since market closed writing these posts so I hope they are useful to somebody. The 1st part introduced Impulse waves rules and guidelines. The 2nd part covered Diagonals and the first corrective waves - zigzags. I also included some examples of actual charts, rather than the simple drawings in the first post. If you have not read part 1 or 2 yet, please do before reading this. I would advise everyone to save each part and read them over again as they learn.

Anyway, here goes.

**Corrective waves**

*Contracting Triangles:*

Rules:

* A triangle always subdivides into five waves
* At least four waves among waves A, B, C, D and E each subdivide into a zigzag or zigzag combination
* Wave C never moves beyond the end of wave A, wave D never moves beyond the end of wave B, and wave E never moves beyond the end of C. The result is that, going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D converges with a line connecting the ends of waves A and C (forming a triangle)
* A triangle never has more than one complex subwave, in which case it is always a zigzag combination or a triangle.

Guidelines:

* Usually, wave C subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves
* Sometimes, wave D subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves
* Sometimes one of the waves, usually wave C, D, or E, subdivides into a contracting or barrier triangle. Often the effect is as if the entire triangle consisted of nine zigzags
* About 60% of the time, wave B does not end beyond the start of wave A. When it does, the triangle is called a running triangle

*Barrier Triangle*

* A barrier triangle has the same characteristics as a contracting triangle except that waves B and D end at essentially the same level
* When wave 5 follows a triangle, it is typically either a brief, rapid movement or an exceptionally long extension

&#x200B;

*Expanding Triangle*

Rules:

Most rules are the same as for contracting triangles, with these differences:

* Wave C, D, and E each moves beyond the end of the preceding semi-directional subwave (The result is that going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D diverges from a line connecting the ends of waves A and C)
* Subwaves B, C and D each retrace at least 100% but no more than 150% of the preceding subwave

&#x200B;

Guidelines:

Most guidelines are the same as well, with these differences:

* Subwaves B, C and D usually retrace 105 to 125% of the preceding subwave
* No subwave has yet been observed to subdivide into a triangle

&#x200B;

*Combinations*

Rules:

* Combinations comprise two or three corrective patterns seperated by one or two corrective patterns in the opposite direction, labeled as X (The first corrective pattern is labeled W, the second Y and the third, if there is one, Z)
* A zigzag combination comprises two or three zigzags (in which case it is called a double or triple zigzag)
* A ""double three"" flat combination comprises (in order) a zigzag and a flat, a flat and a zigzag, a flat and a flat, a zigzag and a triangle or a flat and a triangle
* A rare ""triple three"" flat combination comprises three flats
* Double and triple zigzags take the place of zigzags and double and triple threes take the place of flats and triangles
* An expanding triangle has yet to be observed as a component of a combination

Guidelines:

* When a zigzag or flat appears too small to be the entire wave with respect to the preceding wave (or if it is to be wave 4, the preceding wave 2) a combination is likely.

**General Advice For Using Elliot Waves**

* The best approach is deductive reasoning. By knowing what Elliot rules will not allow, you can deduce that whatever remains is the proper perspective
* Have a preferred count and an alternative count - Its important not to be biased when trading!
* Always invest with the preferred count - until proven wrong!

&#x200B;

I just want to leave this last note as well:

The trick to trading is to notice that it is all just waves within waves. Patterns within patterns. Whether it is on the 1 minute time frame, the 1 hour, or the 1 month. The patterns are the same, just of different amplitudes. The bigger the time frame, the more important the pattern. The same could be said of life really. Shit happens, but its only one event in the grand scheme of things. Zoom out if you need to. And if that doesn't help - Zoom out again.

I dare you to find any other stock with same float and potential!

2- $UWMC has a massive Gamma squeeze potential if it reaches 10$+ and stays over. The open interest is insane and to put that into perspective, there are 91,835 Calls(I'm only counting the upcoming 2 dates April and May with strikes up to 15$)\~ **worth 9,183,500 shares which equals Approx 10% of FLOAT if they get exercised!!!** Can you comprehend how insane is that? and I didn't even count all the calls... These are only for the 2 upcoming dates.

Bellow is the most recent Call Option Chain (I used Crayons to better illustrate):

[Option Chain April](https://preview.redd.it/vf4kof6aomo61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c46ed9d9cdae14e4a1c52e1e4aa5bcdde167e9)

[Option Chain May](https://preview.redd.it/vyv4s7ccomo61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ede5f7729a4cf909acfb6a11cdbfea0f96c6d92)

3- Now for the short squeeze potential, This month's short interest hasn't been out yet, but we can try to approximate it by taking a look at the short volume. For the past 5 Business days, **$UWMC had a short volume with an average of 24.288 and on Thursday it was 32.09(Fintel)!!** To put that into perspective, $AMC, a heavily shorted stock, had an average short volume of only 15.24 for the past 5 business days(Fintel). **With this low float and high short volume, this could be a Mars shot passing the Moon...**

[Short Volume](https://preview.redd.it/mt6wenfgomo61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f33dd04302d321a993a227c1a4bc45ec4868b01)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\- Even without the trinity, $UWMC is still an undervalued stock. It has a fair value of 19.68$ on SWS!! I could go into details about how it's undervalued, but I'm not going to do that today. You can Look at other DD's on WSB.

\- By now, $UWMC is all over WSB and in my opinion it's only a matter of time until it moons in a one shot to the moon.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For the most important part

What this stock really needs is exposure. If you believe in it and think it’s undervalued, **you can share $UWMC posts or make your own DD to give this stock more exposure.** **Every post matters!!** If people believe in it as much as you do, they might buy it and we can hopefully all eat Tendies on the  Moon(soon)!! **I hope it trends on StockTwits one day because ST is a market mover in my opinion.**

**I wouldn't buy any call options anymore because they will not only not push the stock upwards, but  they also have a very high risk of expiring worthless!**

**My short term Price target is 39$**",
mavc3b,gruft8z,wallstreetbets,comment,1616440949,"Ugh. UWMC is not a squeeze, it's not a meme, it's not a p'n'd. It's a value play from fundamentals, and no one should be buying into it unless they can afford to wait several weeks.  


If anything, the stock needs less attention, since every over-the-hill losing-their-edge greyhaired analyst loves fucking over WSB darlings now that it's a household name.",
mavc3b,gruhjbd,wallstreetbets,comment,1616441727,"It has a low float, yes. Gamma squeeze.... no. Short squeeze, really doubt it. Its a good long term play if you have money to invest and wait. And by invest, I mean buying shares, not retarded options. 

With that said, this is wsb, so fuck investing. Start buying FD's. 

Seriously though I know there's about 8 million noobs reading these things and thinking ""easy money"" ... it's not, it's a good long term play (investment) or a gamble.

&#x200B;

It seems after the comparisons, in terms of PFOF fees relative to costs, Chase might be the best brokerage. As for how fast Chase orders are, I could not find any information.

I assume the brokerages that posted their execution speeds are ones that are confident they are far above average.

Also, do keep in mind there's also stuffs like price improvement, execution price, effective spread, etc. to take into account. I just wanted to sum up some of the brokerages.

I use Fidelity as my main brokerage.

What are your thoughts/recommendations on which brokerage to use?",['SPGI']

And yall literally just voted on AMC proposing to dilute shares for a ~~first~~, ~~second~~, ~~third~~, ~~fourth~~, *fifth* time in 12 months.

Until the company produces *a valuable promise of a ROI + boon for days* i absolutely do not understand why anyone would participate in such a selfless charity stock.

maxzm0,grv8pzd,wallstreetbets,comment,1616454568,"Based on this if eps is $2.10, that means the p/e is trading at 4.16. I believe rkt is currently trading at a 6.8. In q4 2020 Uwmc had 54b in closed loan volume in with 305bps of margin. 

For q1 2021 they guided for closed loan volume of 52-57b and total margin of 200-235bps, their going to have roughly 20% less profit q1 compared to q4. 

This would make their P/E ratio closer to 5. Still undervalued and I’m not sure how much of their guidance, if any factored in the relaunching of their jumbo loan program. 

I can see why the stock didn’t take off After hours on this release, there isn’t really anything new in this that wasn’t already factored in. 

It’s definitely trading under fair value but it’s going to need a new catalyst in order to get this back over 10, I.e index inclusion, blowout q1 earnings etc. 

I have a boat load of 4/16 calls but I think time is pretty much up on those and will be taking the L and rolling them out to august calls.

masv43,,wallstreetbets,post,1616433607,"Volatility Skew in GME options**TL:DR: just another reason not to get jacked to the tits on 600, 700, 800calls.  Market makers have hiked up the IV.  Which means you can only buy 2/3rds the amount of calls vs flat skew; thus reducing your ability to cause a gamma squeeze.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cg3cauvf2mo61.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5eb3f4b19fddb2e4afae0f665c18036f259c344

Additional detail:

Skew is term to describe IV of Out-of-the-money strikes vs at-the-money.  Typically you will either see flat skew (all strikes similar IV), or skew in the lower strikes (higher IV).  Sometimes you will see negative skew (lower IV) in higher strikes.

\[Note: I am simply going to say lower or higher strikes rather than calls / puts, since they are synthetically the same depending on how much stock you have.  So for you all you noobs, a 1:1 covered call is synthetically the same as being short the same strike put\]

This is primarily due to supply/demand.  Since nearly everyone is net long, when they get scared they might either paper-hand their longs, or buy lower strike puts.  When their stocks are going up, they might sell higher strike calls (covered calls).  

But for GME the IV is much higher for the higher strikes.  This could be because:

* Too much demand, either a) apes going bananas or b) people who want to get front-spread (short at the money gamma) needing to buy out the money protection so that they can show their risk manager they don't have unlimited risk.
* Not enough supply, because no one is going to sell OTM calls since they fear the Planet of the Apes.
* Price-gouging: because they know the apes are price-insensitive and need their heroine fix, so just jack up the prices, and the apes won't even know it.  

Do whatever you want, I am rooting for the ape army.  But just be aware that creating a gamma squeeze is harder with the jacked up skew.",

maubsk,,wallstreetbets,post,1616437400,"Big Catalyst tomorrow for RKT!Tomorrow's a big day for RKT!

At this point, it's painfully clear that the stock price is being artificially kept down. Shares available to borrow dropped from **6,700,000** last Tuesday to **200,000** today.

Let's do some quick maths:

Tomorrow all shareholders get a special dividend of $1.11 per share.

With a Public Float of 108.45 mm shares and 39.66 mm shares shorted (as of Feb 26 per Yahoo)

No we all know a dividend of $1.11 isn't going to scare shorts off. But what I believe will catch them off guard is the Re-Investment of those dividends.

If EVERYONE re-invests the dividend, that's:

(108.45mm+39.66mm) \* 1.11 = **$164,402,100**

$164,402,100 / $23.89 (Current Max Pain Price) = **6,881,628** shares of buying power! There are only **200,000** share left to borrow.

This could make the stock go **PARABOLIC**

# But's I'm a long-term investor, it's a great company, I don't want it to become a MEME stock...

YES YOU DO. Why? Because think about who the retail investors who would be paying attention if/when it goes parabolic. These retail are Millennials and Gen Z. That means they are looking for their first car loans or first home loans! They are College Students and Grad Students, Engineers/ people passionate about creating change. Not only are they the exact demographic that would be Rocket consumers, they are also the exact demographic that Dan Gilbert wants to recruit to Detroit to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon!

Take me for example, I'm 32 and looking to buy my first home soon. I was planning to go the traditional route, talk to some banks... blah blah blah. After seeing RKT and reading about Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner, I'll most likely end up using Rocket! Now take me and times that by millions around the world!

By ""sacrificing"" your dividend (by buying into an undervalued stock... poor you), you would be boosting the value of the rest of your investment by improving the very fundamentals of the company itself. It's a no brainer!

# Don't most people take the dividend as cash?

Under normal circumstances at a mature company, yes, people take the cash because the company has nothing else to do with the money. This, however, is a **special** dividend. RKT is nowhere near done growing. In fact, they went public in order TO grow. They didn't do it for the cash. This is from an article from when they first went public.

[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)

>*Rocket Companies already is the nation's largest mortgage lender. It closed $145 billion in loans in 2019 and recorded $893.4 million in profit on revenue of more than $5.1 billion. Gilbert founded the company in 1985. In 2010, he moved its headquarters from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. The company employs some 20,000 across the country with most based in Detroit.*  
>  
>***While Quicken's coffers do not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said, going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.***  
>  
>***""That’s a lot easier to do when you’re a public company,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and software people.""***

Dan Gilbert is trying to build the next Amazon... they only STARTED!!

This dividend was given out to bust the shorts. I'm sure many thought that the ANNOUCEMENT was to bust shorts....no... it's the **Re-Investment** that will bust shorts.

The Play : Don't just buy options. That doesn't help, you just end up handing the MMs money. If you're not in this already, it should be a 60/40 split on Shares/ Options Or something like that. Obviously since the event is tomorrow, I bought a bunch of weekly options (not a lot compared to my overall investment in RKT), but I can't in good conscious recommend that to anyone, weeklies are just straight gambling. Buy shares! I'm not sure when the best options play would be since I'm not sure when the next catalyst would be, there's a buyback looming, could be anytime.

Positions- 24k shares and calls splattered throughout the options chain. GL!

maubsk,grufyx2,wallstreetbets,comment,1616441020,"Here's some more RKT fuel for you: change in open interest on 3/26 calls from Friday to today.

* 23.89 +300

* 28.89 +200
* 29.89 +300
* 30.89 +1100

That's 7900 OTM contracts that are new today. Given RKT's low delta, that's probably another 500k shares that have not been purchased if a gamma squeeze happens. Sadly, I forgot to SS the OTM puts so can't be more accurate.

There is 74% institutional ownership, so using that as a proxy for dividend reinvestment with 113M shares float, that's 4M shares that need to be purchased. 

Shorts have obtained shares that are about inline (6M vs 4M) with dividend reinvestment purchases, so hopefully we get someone buying in heavy tomorrow (share buyback maybe?). Shorts will be out of ammo and MMs will have to buy shares. If a bill appears for first time home buyer credit, that will also do it.

Hopefully the tendie gods will show us favor tomorrow.",

Amyris Tldr; They have used machine learning and AI to solve/map genetic pathways in yeast to create almost any molecule at production scale. I believe that the price could hit 2k-4k per share one day


Once it runs, this is literally a fucking money printer.

The modded yeast eat sugar and shit out a more expensive molecule (like CBG/CBD). They already have mapped out 400+ molecules. It’s like they have a machine where if you feed it a dime, it spits out a quarter. Even a retard can understand this math.

They have the google maps for yeast and everyone else is navigating by the stars. And they patented the shit out of all the major streets so no one can follow them.
If green sustainability had a dick, it would have such a huge hard on for this company. They replace dirty chemistry with clean, sustainable, low cost, and better organic chemisty.

How did they get so fucked in the first place?
They tried biofuels but gas prices went down so they got boned and couldn't compete. They pivoted to flavors and fragrances because that stuff is worth more per kilogram than fuel. So they rested there like a wounded animal while still dumping 70M into RnD yearly. And now bankruptcy is off the table. Their consumer brands are taking off and they are rising like a goddamn yeast phoenix. It cost them 2B to get to this point.

Why should you buy? - Pick from the list below. I know you've put your money in tickers with less potential.They are a part of BioMade which is the U.S. initiative for a syntheic bio industrial revolution. Think about it, fermentation plants across the U.S. and it becomes the largest chemical/raw materials exporter.

-13 molecules at commercial scale and 18 in the pipeline. They can take any molecule to commercial scale in under a year.

-they are making a protein platform, beyond meat and impossible foods better watch out.

-they can claim ""all natural"" on all their products

-The golden goose tendie machine - yeast map

-vaccine play - they produce squalene which is used as an adjuvant to boost vaccine efficacy. It also saves millions of sharks from being killed

-they teamed up with IDRI to create a 2nd gen vaccine an SA-mRNA vaccine that can be stored room temp for 8months, longer if kept cold.

-they worked with DARPA living foundries program to develop their machine learning

-they make sustainable jetfuel with the Navy

-they are working on a monoclonal antibody platform, no more twiddling hamster ovaries

-also HMO (titty milk sugars) platform, and an mRNA (printing vaccine antigen) platform.

-they have created next gen sweeteners which will help our fat asses consume less sugar without the fake taste. and they are partnering with Raizen on it

-they are a cannabis play - they produce CBD and CBG at commercial scale (there is a lawsuit but it looks frivolous, just look up the lawyers on both sides. Amy is going to be fine)

-Its P/S multiple is around 10-15x and similar companies have 100x.

-its only 3B mcap. This thing can run.

-5 years ahead of competitors

-800+ patent wall. They have locked yeast down.

-their tech is being applied to other organisms too


Imagine an economy that can produce chemicals sustainably and if a pandemic arises, it can immediately shift production to counter it.
This is a ten year trip to Tendie Town. You can hop off whenever you have had your fill. You retards are looking at the next (Genetic) Microsoft. Machines are here to help us master DNA. Synthetic Bio is the future.

Part 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




And for you monkeys that are having FOMO, we’re just getting started on our trip to Tendie Town... allow me to explain.


500M dollar protein platform deal expected to close before the end of March
-It’s only a ~5B dollar company, we’re all retarded here but that one single deal compared to the companies entire valuation is easy fucking tendies boys. 

-It's a plant protein platform. Like what Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods does but better. Amyris has perfected yeast, they will be able to be more cost effective.

-This is just a single branch of their company. Think of Amyris as a BYND that can make any molecule found in nature - not just proteins.  

-mRNA platform and mAB platform

-Both of these platforms are set to come up later this year and be more active early 2022.

-mRNA platform - they already have the best adjuvant that can make vaccines last 8 months at room temperatures. To take it a step further, they are in progress of being able to print out mRNA. This would be massive in cutting costs and also making an absurd amount of vaccines in a short amount of time. We’d be sort of pandemic proof. 

-mAB platform - monoclonal antibodies are like artificial antibodies that can be programmed to target cancers. Extremely valuable but a bitch to produce with current methods (you have to twiddle some hamster ovaries)

-There is no need to do any inventing or research to develop mRNA or mABs, that is what Amyris’ customers do. Amy just mods the yeast to pump this shit out.

Amy is the kind of girl that doesn't forget to play with your balls while she is blowing up your account with the Gluck Gluck 9000. That is the kind of girl you keep around. Amyris is the 10 Year Tendie Play. I’m going to be here for a while, you’re going to see more and more of my gains. 


You know how you wished to get into TSLA when it was smaller? Here is your chance. It is a company with even more potential and a better impact on the environment. I only covered three branches of this company. How many more branches are you going to let slap you in the face until you realize this is an amazing buy at any price.





Part 3

~500M of deals will close for Amyris around the end of the month. I know this because I am on every conference call or presentation they give. I don't believe the market has priced this in because Amy is still relatively unknown. So if you ever wanted to become a Yeast Bro or (if you have the monies) a Yeast Beast… do your DD and consider this stock.

And by popular request from the comments…

The Bad Stuff and why you shouldn't buy this stock

-881M lawsuit by Lavvan, read it yourselves and form your own opinions. I saw that John Doerr added way more knowing all of this and so are many institutions. So I am not too worried. (This shows you how valuable that yeast is)

-Capacity capacity capacity. Their current plant is already maxed out and they are working on another one. They need this second plant to come up without any interruption so that they can continue with their future projections. If there are any stalls, this would be a problem because each plant costs 70M and can return 200-400M per year in revenue.

-It has I think ~100-150M in debt. I think they are planning to pay 50M towards it this year

maiolz,,wallstreetbets,post,1616402547,"The arbitrage Michael Burry trade on VolkswagenMichael Burry said **“I don’t own a Porsche, but I own the Porsche that owns VW that owns Porsche”**. Your autistic brain is most likely confused right now, what did this retard say? Let me explain.

**Burry is essentially indirectly buying Volkswagen shares at a significant discount. He's doing this by investing into Porsche SE (POAHY) instead of Volkswagen (VWAGY).**

* Porsche SE is the largest stakeholder of Volkswagen, they own 31.4% of the entire company.
* Porsche SE also holds the largest Volkswagen voting rights (ordinary shares) at 53.3% 
* Porsche SE is not the Porsche car brand (known as Porsche AG)
* An investment into Porsche SE (POAHY), is an investment into Volkswagen at a discounted share price. The Volkswagen shares that Porsche SE owns is significantly worth more than Porsche SE’s current market-cap.
* Volkswagen current market-cap is 153 billion, 31% of that is 48 billion. There should also be an extra premium on top of that $48 billion as they hold 53.3% of Volkswagen majority voting rights. Porsche SE current market-cap is only 31.5 billion. 
* Porsche SE also has other investments in Lidar and software companies such as Aurora Labs/AEVA.
* This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn’t fixed.
* Simply put, Porsche SE has the largest ownership and majority voting rights of Volkswagen.

Volkswagen recently had their own type of ""battery day"" and showed they're dedicated into investing in a EV future (More than $40 billion). They sold more than 9 million vehicles worldwide last year compared to Tesla's under 500K. Tesla lost double digit EV marketshare in Europe in 2020 and the VW ID3 is closing in on Tesla Model 3 sales. Volkswagen has the large customer base, brand power, assets, factories, and EV tech to dominate Europe in the EV industry soon. 

TLDR: Porsche SE (POAHY) seems to be the best way to invest into Volkswagen's EV future at a major discounted price.

mabmyk,,wallstreetbets,post,1616376862,"You’re buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. Why do you hate money? Technicals 101 for beginners.**Not a trading advise.**

Hey there folks and congratulations if you haven’t blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you’re down, that’s understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we’ve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.

Bright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It’s like we are little puppies.

**So, what do we do?**

We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It’s gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it’ll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don’t worry. Basics are super simple and I won’t confuse you with pattern terminology.

If you’re not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.

I received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I’m sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.

**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we’re going to cover today.

You’re gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.

I'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.

https://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f

**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.

About 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.

I saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.

&#x200B;

Let’s step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.

We’re gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it’s 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.

On **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.

On **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Stay with me.

**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**

Here's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.

https://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b

Super simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**

Now, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.

Using same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.

Next, we’re going to add to our chart what’s proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.

Guess what price GE closed on Friday. 🤯

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc

**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**

No. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There’s a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we’re seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4

&#x200B;

**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**

We look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that’s a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.

If we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.

**Here’s the part that matters for you the most.**

Do not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.

We see paper handing comments all the time. “If I were to hold two more days, I could’ve doubled my money”.

Why would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it’s close to resistance.

**What about red candles inside the channel?** 

It's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would’ve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.

**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don’t look back.**

Apply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**

**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**

This is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.

I added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. 

https://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6

At this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.

**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We’re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It’s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.

What I know is this. I’m not touching TSLA. I’m not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.

I want to see resistance break and hold for calls.

I want to see support fail for puts.

Don't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That’s gambling not trading.

I get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, “Shit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?”

Well sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It’s a treasure hunt.

This is the way.

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%.

**Volume - catalysts**

I put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME. Let me be clear, volume is king. Volume is god. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend (that might be an understatement tbh). If you look at GME's chart, every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume. This is not unique to GME, as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price:

https://preview.redd.it/x4y89amnrfo61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f162175a836a710ce3896fa61f45706ded9fdc2e

&#x200B;

Understand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike, as with any stock. The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side. Again, this is not exclusive to GME. When a stock has a great earnings report, acquisition news, FDA approval, etc, you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase (or decrease) in price. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, ""ok Uncle Hank, but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase."" Well, volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock, so that begs the question, what makes more people buy or sell a stock? Catalysts. We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts. I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float, so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds, so when there is news, demand spikes while supply is still low. I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this. First, here is a pic of GME's volume since January. I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY:

https://preview.redd.it/mhtvivaprfo61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31b6d1d9b3521a4c18be7636526e13d8c334dd7

&#x200B;

The very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME. This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months. I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME. The first big spike on here is in early January (11-13th ish), which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board. This is when people were like ""ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT, but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button""). In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump, which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position, which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet (dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum). This is where things really started to kick off. After this, there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets, Chamath support, Mark Cuban talking to us, media coverage, and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100%. This was the frenzy of late January. After that, everything died down regarding volume, price, and media attention. HOWEVER, the volume picked back up (and price corresponded) when GME ousted their CFO. Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this. Full disclosure, I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time, and this showed me its true power. We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company. Since then, volume has gone down. The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is:

https://preview.redd.it/pc3a5kxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21bb57d541c82bd0973f991f608243999a05189

https://preview.redd.it/5p55jvxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d87c7618a76a429820adce815d235cbecc0601

https://preview.redd.it/dzq9bkxqrfo61.png?width=171&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b11369d73f5a62f36b5cbaf5ee82194a4b7457

&#x200B;

So, now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME. When people talk about (X will move GME), they are saying that the event will create positive volume, which will allow GME to rise. So, what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise? Earnings is obviously the closest one. The actual numbers don't really matter here. If GME beats significantly, it might cause a rise, but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call. On the conference call, if we hear news about the digital transformation, acquisitions, a new CFO, or anything relating to Cohen, there will be massive volume and a price increase. If those things are not discussed on the earnings call, then they will be catalysts in the next few months. If GME appoints a new CFO, I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one. If Cohen gets appointed CEO... oh.... get fucking ready. So, now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of ""the squeeze might happen here"" or ""the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming"" are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume.

**OBV**

""But Uncle Hank, what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes."" Glad you asked, that's where OBV comes into play. OBV (on balance volume). is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price (keep that idea in the back of your head). For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade, precedes means it comes before. OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation. In this calculation, the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total, which is denoted by a line, depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). If a candle is neutral, the volume of that candle will not be added. Thankfully, GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile. If it's positive, the volume is added to the total, if it's negative, the volume is subtracted from the total. For example (these are random numbers, don't start eating your crayons yet), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. OBV is a trend indicator (remember volume proceeds price), so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant, rather the trend of OBV is what matters. Because volume proceeds price, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. IMO, OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating, and oh would you look at that, GME is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price. The below pic shows GME's OBV (the yellow line) on different time scales.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbx8r3trfo61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b39b2ffdc2872f94b062827d8ae30dff7c6ba

&#x200B;

So what does this mean? Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well: The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move.

So, now you understand that volume is king, we need volume for GME to increase, volume is not increasing, but OBV is still increasing. This is good.

**SPY and VIX**

Many of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta (I've seen -2, -8, and even -13). Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market. A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market (if the market is up, it is up proportionately). A negative beta, however, means the opposite. It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen some of the other DDs, you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is. There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta. Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market. Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX. SPY and VIX are the purple lines (first one is VIX, second is SPY):

Though the correlation is not perfect, you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX. This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence, high volume, and volatility, which are exactly what GME needs. Lucky for us, SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now. The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY, and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10-year bond, which will push the stock market down. Essentially, the market is overbought, needs to pull back, is overinflated, and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation. Again, volume is more important than this, but this is just something good to keep in line.

**Support and resistance**

https://preview.redd.it/slo3fv3wrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3f924e3df995fb61353f38129c591ccf86a835

&#x200B;

In this section, I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed. Again, sorry for all of the lines, I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory, so I cannot help myself. The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line. This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February. We have however since broken that resistance. As many of you know, previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME. That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since. Is this because of psychological levels? Is it a whale doing that on purpose? Is it the hedgies playing games? It's impossible to know, just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me. The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support... let's not talk about that and hope we never get there. The fat green, yellow, and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance. We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack. Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support. If we can get above the red line and stay there... MOON. Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have, especially because of how tested it has been.

**Current patterns**

Looking at the chart, I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish. First, you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles. I can 100% see that pattern forming, and believe in its merit. Since there are so many posts on it, I won't waste your time with a picture. The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100. This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line:

https://preview.redd.it/u3crqynxrfo61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1df9c8da258c7a6b8c4ee448dd71fa8c71a6da

&#x200B;

As you can see, we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that (180ish) as our current iron-clad support. From there, I saw a bullish pennant pattern (the two orange lines), however, as many of you know, this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support. Instead of forming a pennant, I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern:

https://preview.redd.it/o3eub5fzrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=103c416b860eb08f28d61d28ad95e05510d26b26

&#x200B;

That current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way. Now, why are these patterns bullish? When a stock makes a move upward or downward, then consolidates, it typically continues that pattern. Here is an explanation of that:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjjz7nk0sfo61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7dbdf8552c45fe147371cafdfb4002e5f63c42

As you can see, the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend. This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory, which I am a huge supporter of. Just wanted to give a shout-out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what EWT is, it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements, consolidating movements, and corrective movements. GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement, which is bullish. I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated, so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it. With all of this in mind, it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them. It is moving in a stair-step pattern where it shoots up, consolidates, then uses the previous resistance as support. This is extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/z0fiv5g1sfo61.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90c277e9796d2d5485c1633a522c18d7d85cdae

**TTM Squeeze, MACD, Ichimoku:**

Some of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze, MACD, and Ichimoku. These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators. TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels. It moves similarly to MACD, which also predicts momentum. Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends. All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general, so do some research on your own to better understand them. Importantly, all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME. Below, I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators (because that's how I use them). On the one week chart, the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/wc7ah2h2sfo61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6566627a85061b76dc9ea3e5e6321c60e4dd4e

The MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend (MACD is the two lines indicators. When the blue line is over the yellow one, it's bullish. The wider the distance, the more bullish). TTM also indicates the start of a very big move. When TTM is light blue, we are in the stage of the greatest momentum (you can see the light blue from late January). When we are in a dark blue phase, there is still bullish momentum but its dying). When we go into a red phase, we are in a bearish phase (you can see that throughout February). Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying. From here, we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory (light blue candles). This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now. I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes. Finally, Ichimoku. This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator. All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud, this is an indication of bullish momentum. Well, would you look at that, GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings:

https://preview.redd.it/i1bonxi3sfo61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0067ba6738df71b367ff56765f3fbb6de790e53

These three indicators are great on their own, but when used together they are even more powerful. MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW. Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness. THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning.

**A note about the ""short attacks""**

As many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these ""short attacks"" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories.

Like I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.

**More on why paperhanding is stupid:**

The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:

**A Note about squeezes**

Before I go any further, please understand that last time was not a short squeeze. Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes. A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time. A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze. Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze. The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying, which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float. The buying pressure creates immense price increases, which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover (which only increases the buying pressure and price increases). This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares (gamma squeeze). Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time. If it did happen, you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time. It should look similar to the VW short squeeze. So, anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over, look at the chart, see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW, finish jacking off, and thank Uncle Hank. To add more to this, if the squeeze truly did happen, then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50% short interest.

**Why short interest might not matter**

If your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me, then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50% like FINRA says. I've seen posts that say it's 65%, 120%, 200%, and even 900%. Let me tell you, those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying. I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts. The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing. Again, I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD, and again, I agree with it, but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is. Now, I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter. This is just a hypothesis, feel free to disagree with me below. I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts (see above) because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float. I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell. This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall. It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold. Because of this, when there is good news on GME, all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock, which is mostly held by retail traders, which creates massive buy pressure. Essentially, because of WSB users diamond hands, every time there is positive news on GME, it creates a gamma squeeze. Again, this is just a hypothesis. Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen? Yes. However, I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME, which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile. In essence, diamond hands is fucking working.

**FTD Squeeze**

I would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME. I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon, which will lead to the actual squeeze. I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD. That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts. If someone could link it in a comment below, I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it. Also, just as another note, if you look at iBorrowDesk, GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days. Borrow rate is still super low, but this is just an interesting thing to look at.

**Closing Thots**

In short, I like the stock. If there is anything that you take away from this, remember, volume is king, the short squeeze has not happened yet, short interest might not matter, and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon. Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Finally, I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account.

mb2mjb,,wallstreetbets,post,1616460812,"AMRSHey guys I just wanted to share with you a company that I think can be a 10x stock in less than 5 years. The ticker is AMRS.

Amyris is a biotech company that has figured out a way to bioengineer the DNA of yeast bacteria in order to produce any naturally occurring molecule found in nature. Normally yeast consumes sugar to produce ethanol, but Amyris has found a way to feed the yeast sugar cane and produce any molecule they want. Not only can they produce any molecule they want, but they can scale the molecules to commercial 200,000 liter fermentation tanks. Ok cool, so they can make molecules, big deal, what does this actually mean? Well this is where it gets interesting. These molecules that they are creating, are disrupting and replacing traditional molecules that are harvested from plants or produced from fossil fuels. Some of these ingredients include, Reb M, (replacing sugar and stevia), Vanillin (replacing vanilla flavor), Squalane (replacing Squalane which is used in lotions/skin care products), CBG (replacing CBD because it is more effective). This is just a few in the 18 molecules they have in the current pipeline.

Ok cool, so they can replace traditional molecules/ingredients, big deal? But thing is, it IS a big deal. Amyris is able to replace these traditional molecules because they are able to do it at a cheaper cost because they use sugar cane waste from sugar cane plantations, they are able to do it at large commercial scale, and they are able to produce the molecules even purer than traditional means.

 This industry is in its infancy still but bioengineering bacteria hosts to produce chemistry is the future of the materials industry, especially as resources become more scarce and demand for sustainable ingredients/molecules increase. The company currently produces 3-4 molecules each year at scale (industrial fermentation tanks) and has 12 molecules currently being produced and sold. Not to mention (450) molecules in the pipeline ready to take to market when the time is right.
 
What they are doing is extremely smart right now. They are creating their own consumer brands and using the ingredients that they bioengineer to sell to the consumer for super high markup. They are able to make 50-60% gross profit margin on these products... This is an insane amount of profit on sale.. They already have 3 consumer brands and are launching 5 more this year. They plan to get each brand to a billion dollar valuated company...

Now, here is where it gets interesting. They are using the profits from the consumer brand sales to fund the growth into the ingredient sales business... This is huge because this will allow them to build more manufacturing facilities to be able to produce more chemicals for more companies willing to sell them. These other companies have to pay Amyris for the ingredients out right, pay them royalties, OR license out the molecules (kind of like a software license). It's kind of like how tesla started. They started with extremely expensive electric sports car, had to sell a bunch of these at a high markup so they could afford to grow and build mass market vehicles for the everyday person.

Oh yeah and did I mention that Amyris is the only one of it's biotech peers that will be profitable this year and be able to self fund all of it's growth going forward?

This company is disrupting the chemical materials industry and IS THE FUTURE of the synthetic biology industrial revolution.

If you want to learn more about this company there are a few great videos that explain what the company is doing. The analyst, Graham Tanaka has some videos of the interview with the CEO and the VP of R&D here:

mavkie,,wallstreetbets,post,1616440671,"Treasury Issuance Calendar for the Next Week, and why that matters.If you have been in anything other than GME for the past month, you've undoubtedly asked yourself ""what is a yield and why is it fucking up my tech holdings?"" Well, here's a quick explanation and what to look out for this week.

*What does yields have to do with it?*  Yields, or most likely what it's referencing (the 10 year yield on US Treasuries) is the risk-free rate. Basically if you buy a 10 year treasury for $90 and hold it until maturity, you get a 1.11% annual yield. You absolutely can't go tits up with this unless you bought a North Korean or Turkish Bonds.

In this case, it becomes the price of money. No one is willing to go lower than the 1.11% yield unless they hate money. For mortgages, loans and all sorts of businesses, this is the theoretically cheapest anyone can borrow, since no one has better credit or liquidity as the US government.

In the case of tech stocks, some boomer back in the day decided to value stocks (which provide dividends) as a perpetual bond. The formula for that is P = Coupon/Risk Free Rate. Tech stocks are especially sensitive to this, since the Coupon (returning earnings to shareholders, but you can argue buybacks should be this) is basically 0. Say if $100 = $1/1% is the current ""boomer valuation."" If yields go up only 1% (which isn't that out of place), technically the stock price is supposed to be cut in half.

This is also why valuation methods like this don't work for GME or fast growing companies. In any case, this is just a boilerplate valuation method.

*So what next?* The tantrum all started with the [Feb 2021 7-year auction](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2021/R_20210225_3.pdf) with a high yield of 1.195%. What's pesky about treasury auctions is that once the yield/price is set for the the newest issue (the on the run bond), all previous bonds of the same maturity drop in price/increase in yields as less people want it because it is less liquid.

[You can look at historical prices](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult_query.htm) yourself. Remember when you calculate yields with excel, you need to input the coupon values.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dmzm7yx9pmo61.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b67e8ddd2c754246b3fd644e07f356f9ec6636

The next auctions are set for this [Thursday](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/instit.htm?upcoming), with a similar size of $62 billion on the 7yr and $61 billion on the 5yr. Why do these tenors matter? Apart from them having a certain amount of influence on the 10yr which drives the economy, they are also beyond JPOW's promise of no rate hikes until 2023. A pesky thing called duration exists in the bond market. Basically yield move\*duration=inverse move in prices. On zero-coupon and near-zero-coupon bonds like these, the duration is basically the maturity. This means on your new shiny 1.2% 7yr treasury, if in the near term rates go up 1%, you are expected to have a -7% change on the new price that you can sell on the market.

Many bond holders are expecting inflation (and Fed rate increases) to go up in the next few years, and thus are reluctant to buy now, dropping the price and increasing interest rates, which could set off an entire chain of yield re-pricings if JPOW doesn't get off his sorry ass and gets brrrrrrrring.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pi5zvf4jpmo61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb7d22278b8d19ef9933ec77fa064eab77d590b2

I expect rates to get hotter before we get YCC or some heavy purchases by the Fed. The Fed's actions with ending SLR (thus decreasing the amount of liquidity banks have on hand to do regular short term stuff like commercial paper) and JPOW's disastrously non-~~committal~~brrrrrr interview makes me think the Fed is allowing the market to do its job by tamping down on some exuberance. The first to get hit by hotter rates is absolutely tech.

mavkie,gruiqzn,wallstreetbets,comment,1616442277,Very interesting and exhaustive explanation. If I may add: Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal prompted investors to believe that inflation might rise dramatically in the coming years and this has sparked a huge sector rotation among professional investors.

matvmi,,wallstreetbets,post,1616436238,"GME: Firsthand from a PS4 sellerAfter my thrilling Gamestop experience this weekend I had to share my insights with this group. Hoping to buy another fraction of a share, I drove to my local GameStop only to find that it has gone out of business. I took this as a positive sign for their e-commerce business - this location was no longer needed to grow sales!

Undeterred in my quest to transform my PS4 into 0.4 shares, I borrowed gas money from my little brother to drive to the nearest store. Lo and behold, it was 8 days from going out of business and they weren't buying anything. Clearly, the pivot to e-commerce is moving faster than any of us expected and this thing is going to take off any day now.

Okay! Now let’s get into it.

Based on this, I can make a couple assumptions. First off, theroaringkitty handle tweeted at all times of momentum. There seem to be some tweets that are made during declining and inclining MACD histogram bars. Tweets also range when W%R and DMI Convergence/Divergence are at various levels. 

RC tweets seem to be tweeted as MACD histogram bars are rising, and RC tweets seem to be tweeted when there is general overbuying (W%R is medium-high). Also, RC tweets seem to usually come when there is a strong signal for an uptrend (+DI and ADX are both high).

Elon only tweeted once, but it was literally right before a giant spike in price. There are a few things that I find interesting about this tweet. Volume was very high leading up to the days of this tweet. The +DI to -DI divergence was very high the day before the tweet. Overbuying was very high (high W%R), and the MACD histogram bar doubled in the previous day.

Again, I don’t think we can assume causality from any of these tweets, but it is interesting to look at the technical signals leading up to or after a tweet.",['ICE']

THEN I STARTED READING STUFF ABOUT IT.

This is a slow moving stock, BUT has several catalysts that should easily make for some quick gains (not financial advice) to roll around in or re-invest in GME/AMC/etc.   This reminds me a bit of the short RKT saga, but I am not suggesting there will be a squeeze, just tendies.  

Catalysts:

\- Ex Dividend Date on 3/30, which means buying the stonk or calls for THIS FRIDAY.   Dividend will then be paid out on 4/30.  This is a REIT with a 10.21 div yield, i.e. very high dividend all things relative, so not a bad place to park your money for a second.

\- Earnings call on 4/26

\- COVID impacts starting to waiver.  NLY is a mortgage REIT, the general consensus seems to be that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with COVID, i.e. stonks like this that got hammered are buy opportunities. 

\-Look at the 1 week chart and call prices.  Calls won't get you the dividend and of course are more risky, so buying the stock or playing the options are both viable depending on risk tolerance.

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders. 

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley.  Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1) Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth. 

2) Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin. 

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue. 

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR. 

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to. 

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded. 

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million. 

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season. 

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.
