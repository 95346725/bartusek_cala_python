n5ikkk,,stocks,post,1620228446,"Peloton Recalls Treadmills After Safety Warningshttps://nyti.ms/2QZBxiN

Peloton is recalling its Tread+ and Tread treadmills, the at-home fitness company said on Wednesday, less than a month after it fought the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission as it warned that dozens of injuries and one death of a child had been linked to the machines.

The commission, which issued an “urgent warning” for the machines in April, urged people who own the treadmills to immediately stop using them. Peloton is offering a full refund for the $4,295 machine with a 32-inch touch screen that allows runners to work out with the aid of instructors.

John Foley, the chief executive of Peloton, said in a statement Wednesday that the company had “made a mistake” by fighting the agency’s request to recall the treadmills, and apologized for not engaging “more productively with them from the outset.”

“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s members and their families,” he said in the statement.

The machines were sold in the United States from November to March. The company is working on a repair to be offered to customers “in the coming weeks,” the commission said in a statement. The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.

“Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products,” Robert S. Adler, the acting chairman of the commission, said in the statement.

The commission said it had received 72 reports of adults, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Twenty-nine involved children, including a 6-year-old boy who died.

After the death of the child in March, the company urged users to keep Peloton products where children can’t get to them and store safety keys away from children",['MS']

It’s kind of like an anti-Bezos/Musk as CEO - ie instead of building the business long-term, management seems to be focused on short-term efforts and maximising their own compensation.

n5i8o7,,stocks,post,1620227607,"$ASTS a revolution in 5G [Resubmit]Resubmit: Sorry mods, I made a mistake and provided a link to a youtube channel. Moreover, I added a Risk section as it was lacking before.

Today, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.

*Why should you care?*

The recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).

The company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.

*Alright… 100x if everything goes well, right?*

Yes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).

**Desirability**

*Targeted Segment*

Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST’s satellites like 5G towers in space.
Of the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.

To put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.

*Customer Relationships & Channels*

All the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.

*Value Proposition*

Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.
Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.

**Feasibility**

*Key Partners*

In the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.
They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).

Regarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.

*Key Activities*

AST will design and integrate the satellites. The company’s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.

Of course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.

Future agreements won’t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.

*Key Resources*

Talent, technology, and funding.

Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.

As mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST’s technology and has concluded that it works.

For further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company’s plan for global coverage.

**Viability**

*Revenue Streams*

Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.

*Cost Structure*

Because the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.

Now let's talk about an important topic: Risk.

**Risk**

*Tech(nichal/nology) risks*

* Launch delays for BW3 (final full-size prototype) might increase costs. especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle. This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021.

* Technology does not work. While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1, there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing.

* The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries. Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone.

*Commercial risks*

* End-users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers. Difficult to see why that would be the case.

* Telecom companies do not see value in AST's offering. AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise.

From a risk perspective, technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside. The company could literally go to 0 (or close to it if they can sell some of their techs/patents/etc.). However, I believe the company offers a unique risk/reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market.

**The long-term play**

Shares, shares, shares.

**The short-term play**

The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.
Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers’ agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.

TL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years

Disclosure: 35,000 shares

Edit: While we may see movement on catalysts after the silent period ends, this is mainly a long-term (2-3 years) investment into a very asymmetric opportunity.

Edit2: Thanks for all the feedback so far. I added a Risk section.",['AMT']

n5gg3f,,stocks,post,1620222811,"The 6 phase model of how this uranium bull market might unfoldThe recent run up in equities has people questioning if they missed the top, if they are too late and if this was already the end of a young bull market in uranium. This couldn’t be further from the truth, as a long term price per pound of uranium is still in need of between 50 and 60 dollars. If it doesn’t reach this target within the next three years, we are in for much bigger issues and this will not be allowed to happen in my view. As part of the research document I wrote on uranium investing, I constructed a phase model that walks us through every part of what I think will be a generational bull market. We are very much still in phase 2 of my 6 phase model, but with phase 3 slowly emerging on the horizon. What are these 6 phases you might think? They can be categorized as follows in a stadium like model:

Phase 1, constructing the stadium (2016-2020):

\- The early/smart money, the first time we come out of a prolonged bear market. Equities may not have really moved yet, but it is finally starting to look brighter. After the price of uranium bottomed several years ago, it has crept up slowly but surely, but without proper reaction of the underlying equities. Catalysts are building and around the end of this phase (between July and October of last year) is when I first started sharing my due diligence on here. This phase ended at the start of the first big run up we have seen.

Phase 2, getting on the bus (2020-2021):

\- Once share prices finally move (as we have seen between November and February of this year), it is time for more of the smart money to come in. Those who see that we have finally come out of a bear market and that the busses are slowly being loaded. Price movement will justify the narrative and sharp minds accounting for both retail capital as well as institutional capital will start to position themselves for what is to come. This is the point where we are currently at, waiting for the next move up and for this bus to get going.

Phase 3, arriving at the stadium:

\- Word is spreading of a new investment opportunity and this will likely be marked by the price per pound of uranium going over the 40 dollar mark. As was mentioned above, price movement justifies the narrative and 40 dollar is the first ‘line in the sand’ where we will see increased interest from institutional capital wanting to position themselves for this bull market. This phase can be the shortest or the longest of all of the 6 phases depending on a number of key factors that need to be paid close attention to.

Phase 4, the game begins:

\- This is where the bulk of investors will come in. While we are not early anymore, we are well into this bull market and it still has some legs left. Some people might start taking profits here and leave before the game ends. This can be a smart plan, as scaling out into strength will save you from being hit by phase 6 once it rolls around. In this phase it is clear we are in a full-fledged bull market and it will become more and more regularly discussed by investment communities. Institutional money will be well positioned at this point and will look for a possible exit. I am currently writing an exit strategy on it, based both on history, market psychology and asset valuations. I am not able to share this, as it wouldn’t be fair to my platform, so I apologize for that. This phase will likely be the most volatile as a whole.

Phase 5, the final minutes:

\- As with every highly cyclical bull market, all good things most come to an end. Just like with a game that is all tied a few minutes before the final whistle, emotions are running high and you will see people scrambling to get a glance at the game. This is when general media such as CNBC and investors on social media will be talking about uranium as being “the next big thing”. This is a massive red flag. Yes, you might want to watch this game till the end, but it is much better to try and get out before the mass euphoria reaches its peak. When you see that uranium is as broadly discussed as things like digital meme dogs or EV's for example are right now and spot price severely overshooting the long term price, there is no reason to not take out most of your profits and watch this game go into phase 6.

Phase 6, the game ends (2025):

\- As I said before, all cyclical bull markets must eventually come to an end and this one will be no different. While the timing of this, which I think will be somewhere around 2025, is nothing more than a calculated bet (it could be longer, but also shorter, depending on prevailing market specific but also broad equity market circumstances), fact remains that the final blow off peak we saw in phase 5 in the final minutes of the game will be just as steep to the downside. This will leave a lot of people holding the bag and it will be a rough wake up call, don’t be left standing when the doors close and the lights go out.

Conclusion:

When a game is exciting, you want to stay till the end to make sure you don’t miss anything, this is very understandable as it is human nature to want to get the most out of something. However, the risk associated with trying to time the whistle to the minute is not worth it in my opinion. This doesn’t mean you should sell before the bus even arrives at the stadium, but perhaps it is smart to consider scaling out every few minutes and leave only a very small position (or nothing at all of course) to watch the final minutes of this game. Phases and associated timelines can shift very quickly, so make sure you are adaptive, patient and disciplined, because this will be quite the game and no one will know how long it will last. It could be 4 years, but it could also only be 1 or 2. You have to be adaptive and make sure you have the right information and strategy to make the most of this opportunity. Thank you for reading and as always I wish you all a great day.",

There is solid momentum now with the announcement of the physical uranium trust ala Sprott. The macro thesis is solid and catalysts are growing. I am quite cautious with positioning but I think it’s a great opportunity still to start positioning yourself in miners.

If you are more risk adverse, you can stick with the bigger uranium producers such as Cameco and Kaz. Or even invest in funds that track the actual price of uranium.

I'm an average joe. I don't do options, period.

n4wwl5,,stocks,post,1620159022,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 4, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 4, 2021**

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street's response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

I expect them to beat earnings and give better guidance 

Long-Term I really like the stock b/c of the TAM, Growth, and the future of plant-based meats.

With a $8 billion market cap, I can easily see this 10X within 5-10 years.

People are starting to eat healthier and I am betting on Ethan Brown a visionary CEO to do this.

While there may be competition they have partnerships with YUM Brands, McDonalds, PepsiCo, and others. This gives them quite the competitive advantage going forward.  They’re trying to dominate locally and then expand which is the smartest idea.

Half of the food Americans eat is takeout and I believe that if we go through some sort of frugal decade people in general wil start to eat more healthier and start to be more conscious of what they eat

Even if this is not the case, BYND will be in McDonalds and those big branded restaurants so people will have the choice to order from them.

Truly health-conscious people eat whole foods, not processed foods.  The fake meat products taste pretty darn good, but are still high in sodium and saturated fat, which defeats some of the purpose of consuming them.

While Beyond and Impossible appeal to vegetarians who miss an occasional hamburger, or someone at McDonalds - like you say - who feels guilty, I am not sure it's a real growth product.  It hasn't met its potential yet in any case.  Part of this is because someone who's at McD's in the first place is there for a guilty pleasure, not to compromise on some less-bad-for-you meal.

Finally, the partners are big enough players in the food industry that they may eventually create their own plant alternatives, leaving Beyond, er... behind - as it were.

Those narratives would suggest that restaurants, hotels, airlines, and auto manufacturers are all flying high right now. The problem is, none of it is true.

Since February…

* Tripadvisor, Expedia, and Booking are flat
* Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt are flat
* Ford, GM, and Toyota are flat
* Restaurants are mixed
* Airlines are down

The real rotation isn’t toward any of that. If you put conventional labels aside, this is really a rotation from feel-good stocks to feel-bad stocks. Since February, anything young people actually want to invest in has been annihilated: technology, e-commerce, semiconductors, renewable energy, cannabis, disruptive tech, EVs, and so on. Even if you exclude all the speculation and only include profitable, well-established companies, this is still very much the case.

I liked one guys explanation of options being insurance to your stocks. What I don’t understand is who is the one that gets to choose to go through with it. From my readings (mainly focused on puts for stock holder and call for option trader) it seemed like both had that option and that doesn’t seem correct. 

Last question, I thought I read somewhere you can put a put on stock you don’t own. How does that work?",

n5hmo0,gx1ekt1,stocks,comment,1620229778,"When you buy the option you're the one who has the option whether to exercise the option or not.

If you write a put on a stock that you don't own and the other party decides to exercise the option, then you will be forced to buy the stock from them, and money will be taken from your account to pay for it. You can instruct your broker to set that position to do a ""cashless exercise"" if the other party exercises it. A cashless exercise means that when the stock is given to you it will automatically be sold. What you end up with is the difference between the strike price and the sale price, which is in addition to the premium you collected when you wrote the option.

Writing uncovered options is a fairly high risk proposition, and you won't be allowed to do it if you don't have experience trading options. At first your broker will authorize you to write covered calls and maybe to buy calls and puts, because these are low-risk propositions for which you always have the capital to cover the maximum cost.",

Either sell the put contract to close the position for a profit (this is the most common method since you’d have extrinsic value unless you’re at expiration) or exercise the contract. In this case since you don’t own the stock you’d be short 100 shares of the stock. You would then need to buy back 100 shares of the stock to close the position. Since we’re assuming the put position is profitable, you’d be able to buy back at a lower price thus profiting the difference between the put’s strike and the lower price to bought back at.",

n5e6x1,,stocks,post,1620215894,"Some thoughts about the current state of the market.*This is a weird market right now.  Markets are at the whim of Yellen and Jay Pow, there's uncertainty due to Covid, inflation fears, lots of new money and retail coming in.  Is this sustainable?  Are we headed for doomsday?  Here are my thoughts on all of this.  (Originally meant as a response to the daily thread so it may seem kind of comment-y)*

Me personally I have decided that even if we have a major correction I still like the fundamentals.  There are things to watch out for like high levels of federal and corporate debt, but I don't realistically see that as being an issue at least in the next 10 or so years.  Not all the debt is being put to good use but a lot of it is... the US economy still looks strong and growing.  Inflation is a concern as well, but one can hedge against that and I don't think we'll experience anything truly terrifying like hyperinflation.

The economy is opening back up.  There's pent-up demand for consumer goods and for travel, which encompasses various industries itself.  Biden is pumping money into infrastructure.  High-growth opportunities exist, as we all know, with tech in AI, cloud computing, EVs, renewable energy, etc.  The outlook looks healthy IMO.

Uncertainty around the corner, for sure.  Geopolitical tensions with China (not expecting war but this is a new dynamic).  Climate change.  Inequality and rising debt.  Definitely unprecedented challenges here.  But again, I don't see this as being a serious issue at least for another 10 years if not further out.  An optimist's take would be that, despite a lot of BS in dealing with Covid (anti-masing, anti-vaxxing, etc.), it seems like humanity did alright.  We could have done a lot better, for sure, and I'm sorry for anyone who lost loved ones to this.  But we could have done a lot worse, too.  That makes me somewhat optimistic even in the face of these long-term challenges.

I like the way Biden is handling things, too.  I didn't vote for him.  I actually didn't vote (shoot me).  But from the madness in the Capital to the way things are looking now... this looks like improvement.  It's may not be major, but at least we're headed in the right direction now.  This makes me optimistic for the future as well.

But again, folks.  In the next 10 years or so I'm not really worried at all.  Longer-term, let's see.

This is coming from a new investor who was hesitant about putting his money in to the market this year.  I did the research and I've gotten a handle on things, and my conclusion is what everyone has always said: ""time in the market beats timing the market"".  Now is as good a time as any to invest.  Even if the market falls off a cliff tomorrow, as long as you're accumulating good assets then you're good to go.  I'm sure we've all heard of ""Bob the world's worst market timer"".  He made it out alright.  (If you don't know about him, see [here](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/)).

I recommend diversification, too.  I'm mostly in index funds and that includes VXUS, also.  I also like dividend paying stocks (more than bonds at the moment).  Nothing wrong with alternative assets like real estate or precious metals, either.  Be smart, be safe, and I think we'll be good to go.

This is just what I've gathered over the last few months of diving into all this and doing my research.  I'm new but FWIW my degree was in economics and I've been using that as a launching point to really dive into trying to understand what's going on right now.  The outlook to me looks good... just be smart, and reevaluate a little later on down the line.

And do your own research, of course. =\]",

That makes me somewhat optimistic even in the face of these long-term challenges.

What I've been thinking the past year is: It's amazing how well prepared we were for a *total shutdown*. Video conferencing, online shopping, an mRNA-based Covid vaccine in one year... if this virus had hit us 20 years ago, we would have been much worse off. This is the closet optimist in me speaking but I interpret the positive market trends as the world economy having been tested, like never before, and it staying quite strong all things considered.

I think it will take another year or two to see how it works out long term. But we could be in a way worse position right now. Consider how much stupidity had to be overcome, it's amazing we found a path out of this at all, even if we've not yet escaped.",

*Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday afternoon she wasn’t forecasting interest-rate increases to rein in any inflation spurred by President Joe Biden’s proposed spending, clarifying comments that ruffled financial markets a few hours earlier.*

*“It’s not something I’m predicting or recommending,” Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, said during an online event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. “If anyone appreciates the independence of the Federal Reserve, I think that person is me.”*

*Yellen said she didn’t anticipate a bout of persistently higher inflation, but that if one occurred the central bank has the tools to deal with it. The Biden administration has proposed additional long-term spending packages totaling about $4 trillion on top of the $1.9 trillion it pumped into the economy beginning in March to combat the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.*

EPD because it feels undervalued, has a considerable pipeline and general network, lots of LNG too, delivered robust results in a challenging year (Covid, Texan snow and oil/gas prices) and has a great dividend. It's also an MLP, an advantage in terms of tax (at least for me, as a Brit, means no 15% tax on the divi) over other similar companies.

HUN (especially under $30) I see nobody talking about, but they have made significant changes to their business over the last couple of years, so although revenue is falling, earnings are looking great. It's become a leaner business with a war chest for suitable acquisitions.

I feel both stocks have 15-20% share price growth in the medium term. EPD feels like a solid defensive and divi stock, whilst HUN could be a great growth play, though a respectable current divi all the same, and last week they announced a 15% increase in the divi.",

I want to talk about this ETF I haven't seen mentioned here yet, and one I think could be a very good choice on a short investment.

So NRGU is a gas and oil ETF that tracks major gas and oil exploration/refinement companies on a 3x leverage. It is currently sitting at $157 per share as I write this post.

It's lowest evaluation was at $26 back in October of 2020. Due to the pandemic this ETF fell an astounding $1174 from March 2020 - October of 2020.

For the 4 years before the Pandemic I can track, this ETF traded at anywhere from $700 - $1200.

Even if it only manages to gain back half of it's value post pandemic, that's still $500 - $600 per share.

People are asking why the market is losing so much and others are writing ""stay strong"" messages.

You have to remember that interest rates in the US are at an unhealthy low level. Look around the world: Japan has had zero interest rates for decades, Europe for about ten years. And that's not going to change there anytime soon. Italy and other southern European countries have immense mountains of debt, and the ECB cannot raise taxes under these circumstances. The average person in Europe still tends to have his money invested in bonds or in a savings account, and his money is worth 2% less there every year thanks to inflation. Zero interest rates are robbery! The states in Europe deleverage themselves for 10 years at the expense of their citizens.

At the moment it looks like zero interest rates are a one-way street. The U.S. should return to a normal interest rate level as soon as possible to avoid such conditions. Even if you have to accept that the market will drop 10% (if you are *somewhat* diversified).",

Liberty Defense (TSX:SCAN) (OTC:LDDFF) is a Vancouver-based defense tech developer, that is currently pre-revenue. Their main product, a security system known as HEXWAVE is currently in Beta with a planned release in 2022. What the product is essentially attempting to do is make the process of security checkpoints much faster and more importantly, much safer and accurate. 

The devices are set up like regular securities scanners and as people walk through, it uses 3D imaging and AI to determine and flag potential weapons, both metal and non-metal. It operates in real-time so it has an extremely high throughput of over 1000 people per hour. This tech honestly seems like the stuff of the future but the research they've thrown into it is extremely impressive and with the launch in the near future I think you could start seeing these things everywhere.

Below are some of the groups that have agreed to Beta test HEXWAVE tech (SOME BIG NAMES!)

* FC BAYERN MÜNCHEN
* GREATER TORONTO AIRPORTS AUTHORITY (GTAA)
* METRO TORONTO CONVENTION CENTRE (MTCC)
* VIRGINIA DIVISION OF CAPITOL POLICE (VDCP)
* UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN POLICE DEPARTMENT (UW)
* AND 5 MORE!

These guys are also developing High Definition Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) body and shoe scanners, as well as handheld gunpowder detectors. They are really throwing the kitchen sink into developing modern large-scale security measures and I believe this makes their stock have some serious growth potential.

n5lec2,,stocks,post,1620235480,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor  
**Resolution 2:** I made 3 copies of the sheet in hopes of spreading out the odds of getting in  
   [Copy 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_UjmNI7Zxm76QN3HQ-_cwx3lZ8QbTogyqYTY1oRC9E/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDRkAGtRrXql5RQ-l68cD5lE3XoBMNv3oJsHb_3JK38/edit?usp=sharing)
3. **Resolution 3:** I published them to the web for those that can't get into the files themselves

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

I was hoping for some feedback on my current ETF portfolio as a long term investment.

I hold: VUSA (60%) , INRG (20%) , IITU (10%) and ECAR (10%)

I’m wondering whether to sell off my shares in IITU as a few companies overlap into the S&P 500 ETF which I hold (VUSA). Then rebalancing my ETF portfolio to: VUSA (70%) , INRG (20%) and ECAR (10%). 

The other option was to add a high dividend yield ETF as I’ll be using this as a retirement fund.

If everyone is waiting for a drop, it will most likely never come. Now I want to explain myself on why I think this, feel free to critique it. Suppose you, and 10 others are sitting out of the market, waiting for a correction. Now you don't know these people, but you all have the same intentions. Buy when there's a big enough sale. 

First question you should be asking yourself is what you consider a sale. With this in mind, would the others consider a sale to be above or below your price? If the answer is below, then what's to stop the other 10 from buying out the bottom, leaving you with your dick in your hand? This is on a small scale, but in reality, there's a lot more people, many of which are holding a lot of cash. On the other hand, suppose you think your price is above the estimates of others. Now the other 10 people are not idiots. They are probably thinking the exact same way you are, so if they move that limit buy up, suddenly you've reached the same conclusion as scenario 1.

You see, the issue I have with holding a lot of cash on the side is that you're holding a deprecating asset, in that your money is worth less with inflation. Why not put it in gold for example if you're worried about the market. 
Another issue I've seen is that a lot of people can't put a number to what they'd consider a sale. We have seen a couple pullbacks in this past year where buying would've been very advantageous, and yet a lot of people still sit with cash. For example, there was early November. We had March gone by. I'm sure there were also pullbacks along the way that offered nice entry points, all of which were missed by many. What's to say that you manage to get in at the next sale? What if you miss the next sale by setting a price too low? Will you still be sitting on that cash in 2 years time? There's a reason people say you can't time the market. 
If you really think you can get in at a cheaper price, why not buy 1 share now, and set up a scaletrader to buy 1 share in equal increments until it reaches that point? Worst case scenario, you get 1 share, and have to either wait, or buy in at the added premium. Best case scenario, your prediction was right, and you've now bought all the way down in equal increments, putting your DCA somewhere between the top and bottom. Sitting on cash however is probably not the best thing you can do though.",

The Director of Macro at Fidelity has an amazing twitter. I recommend it. I posted above a specific tweet showing a comparison to a previous similar time period. Notice that the past trend predicted the fall, the bottom, and the rise (all from last year). Then, see the 'correction' that started in April and lasted over summer. Maybe it will happen again?

Obviously there is no way to predict the future. But that type of data analysis can be helpful. Plus, that analysis seems to be a compromise position between the doomsayers (e.g,, the market is going to crash 40%!) and the optimists (e.g, its not going to crash for a very long time, until interest rates rise).

When any of those few companies share prices reach that magic number you’ve developed through your research and chart analysis and when the market conditions look favorable enough to jump back in, you start scaling in and testing your hypothesis while DCAing if you were a bit high on the initial entry. 

I would kinda compare it to playing in a poker tournament. Folding preflop is aggressive, because you are intent on taking big calculated risks when the time is right. I don’t know what’s going to happen but I think tomorrow and this week will be very telling with regards to where we’re headed with this tech selloff.

Lyft’s revenue fell 36%, to $609m, compared to the same period last year. Lyft said it had 13.49m active riders in the first quarter, down more 36.4% from the 21.2m in the same period last year.

Lyft reported an adjusted EBITDA loss totaling $73m in the first quarter, which was far better than anticipated. The company had expected a sharper $135m adjusted EBITDA deficit for the period.

In addition to beating its own Q1 2021 goals to some degree, Lyft posted 7% revenue growth over what it recorded in Q4 2020, a detail that Lyft pointed to as a sign that the company was on the road to recovery. Lyft said ridership also improved some 8% from the previous quarter.

Lyft remains deeply unprofitable, reporting a net loss of $427.3m in the first quarter, a 7.3% worsening from the $398.1m net loss it recorded during the same period last year. Those losses included 128.0m related to changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods.

Despite the heavy losses, Lyft executives said they were buoyed by stronger rider demand, which has picked up in recent months.

Lyft also emphasized the sale of its self-driving unit, called Level 5, announced last week. Lyft sold the unit to Toyota’s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for 550m. Uber also recently sold its self-driving tech (Uber ATG), work that was once seen as existential to the ride-hailing game.

Lyft’s so-called Level 5 division will be folded into Woven Planet Holdings once the transaction closes in the third quarter of 2021. Lyft will receive 550m in cash, with 200m paid upfront. The remaining 350m will be made in payments over five years. About 300 people from Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet.

Lyft's younger but much bigger brother, Uber, reports its own earnings tomorrow.

Everyone seems to be thinking about inflationary risk and how to position themselves, and it sounded like this ETF is a good way to do that without having to try and pick individual stocks myself. What do you guys think?

His strategy seemed to be targeting resource companies that make money not directly from extraction, but through from some complicated financing of their operations that I didn’t really understand. The other large group of companies were financial exchanges like Chicago Mercantile and some data companies than benefit from volume and have relative freedom to adjust to price changes. These justifications seemed sound to me, but again I’m very aware of my ignorance.

Curious what you guys think about this or other options to hedge against inflation. Do ppl like this positioning and believe the underlying reasoning is correct? If not, what is your strategy?",['PPL']
n4untv,gwyinkc,stocks,comment,1620168031,"Hrm. It's an interesting idea.

I didn't listen to the podcast, but I did check out [their holdings](https://horizonkinetics.com/products/etf/infl/#holdings) and if one is looking for a ""thinking persons"" inflation hedge ETF then this is probably the one. 

So with notable exceptions (land trusts/medical/stock exchanges) this ETF is heavy into companies that deal in percentages as income. Interestingly there is no O&G from what I can see where these things are much more common. I think they have pressure not to invest in the sector, because there are lots of options there, particularly in Canada which this fund seems to like.

Anyways, three of the largest holdings are streaming companies I know very well (and the fund is overweight Canada which is very rare), so I'll talk about them to give a bigger picture of what it seems the fund wants to achieve/invest-to-hedge.

Now, the three royalty companies here that I know well are WPM, OR, and FNV. Combined they make up ~11% of the fund. Although the companies aren't identical, they work in similar ways. They invest in promising mines (primarily, but they do have other interests) with the guarantee of a percentage of the mines profits for a set period of time, in a particular way. Like 10% of the gold, in gold and silver, for 5 years for $5 million up front. That's about it. It's a simple business to understand and a hard one to be successful in.  

But if inflation goes up their profits are unaffected, as, the theory goes, they don't run mines, they just cash the cheques/stack the bars, and if there's inflation, commodities will rise with it and so will their profits. The double bonus, again in theory, is that as these companies are primarily in the precious metals scene they will win extra as people ""flee to safety"" in gold. 

Other holdings are heavily weighted towards shit like land trusts (inflation means land gets more valuable right along side); the high-quality stock exchanges of Canada, Singapore, and Australia (inflation means the physical exchanges are worth more, they don't devalue, and may well benefit with the devaluation of USD as  resource and trading economies respectively); etc. 

So yeah, in closing the whole thing is made up of shit that won't get clobbered, and will in fact disproportionately benefit, if the dollar loses like 30% of its value. I don't see hyperinflation on the horizon in anything other than houses and equities however, and so in that case this may underperform the S&P.

n519uc,,stocks,post,1620170315,"$CLOV Investor DD - What is Direct Contracting?Hey ya'll.

So I have been and will continue to invest in Clover Health regardless of short interest or meme-relevance or anything that has actually seemed to make people interested in this stock. But then, it doesn't surprise me that people flock to this stock for meme hype more than anything, because looking into something like Direct Contracting for myself, I realize how *boring* this shit can appear on the surface. Especially if you aren't familiar with the language of healthcare - which for the life of me is so interesting to armchair philosophize about how it got to be the way it is that I have to berate myself from tangenting on it. But that's beside the point.

In this post, I am looking to focus on the forward-looking plan regarding Clover's relation to the CMS's direct contracting **(regardless of the Biden medicare age catalyst or short interest BS or meme hype)**, where it's coming from, and just what the purpose of the program is in the first place. I want to do it all in simple terms, too. I assume most of us aren't experts on this stuff (although not including people dumping literally a million dollars into CLOV... such whales may look down on me as the tender nemo fish that I am). I'll also be including some of my own speculative opinions on it, and I'm using the same unnamed healthcare billing source I've used in my past DD ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/lxgdfv/on_clov_and_doubt_or_why_i_will_continue_buying/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/m2x9dv/excoriating_vivek_garipalli_or_why_i_will/)).

# WHY IS DIRECT CONTRACTING SIGNIFICANT?

So far as most of us odd-to-witness CLOV possessed apes are aware, Direct Contracting is the government program that *should* give Clover access to 200,000 more patients, and when they got approved for Direct Contracting [Vanguard bought 18% of the float](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/7afa14c7-a614-4017-8b29-d4fd59772317) the day of the leak. However, those 200,000 patients seem somewhat variable to me (at least management wasn't totally clear last earnings call); so I deciding to look into what it is about Direct Contracting that prompted one of the most astute investment firms to buy such a large chunk of the float. To give my discovery outright, **I believe it has to do with** ***how the CMS incentivizes change*** **and** ***how Clover Health seeks to take advantage by aligning themselves with the aims of the CMS***. The Clover wiki ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/wiki/index)) is great for explaining how Clover is disrupting healthcare, but I want to emphasize that *the CMS is actually totally in line with this mission*, and it's not just CLOV spinning its wheels trying to enact disruption on its own. (Which is a hella good thing, btw - I'll explain further later on).

*If you want to make up your own mind about all this stuff I'll link the places I'm getting the info here.*

# WHAT IS DIRECT CONTRACTING?

Global and Professional Direct Contracting is a program created by the '*CMS Innovation Center*' as an alternative payment structure to offer risk-sharing benefits to providers, building on what was learned from ACO models in the past five years. I believe Clover stands out because they not only will be sharing the risk, but **because of Clover Assistant, they will be** ***literally*** ***collaborating*** **on the risk**, making them perfectly designed for MSSP and similar programs the CMS is trying to aggressively push towards - against FFS.

**Did you get that?** **If you did, no need to read further.** If you didn't, my fellow small fish CLOVtards, that is what this post is for.

&#x200B;

# Breaking It Down:

It's good to start by clarifying some language.

When you see ""Global and Professional Direct Contracting"" - ""Global"" and ""Professional"" are not empty or generic buzz words. They denote specific things in terms of healthcare terminology.

""Professional"" refers to the Doctor or the Physician. The Doctor is the ""professional"" of healthcare. They're the pro players getting stuff done.

""Global"", I initially thought, meant ""International"".

**IT DOES NOT - DO NOT BE SMOOTH BRAIN APE LIKE ME**. ""Global"" refers to a payment structure that involves an insurer (or Medicare) paying a ""global rate"" to a specific organization for taking care of a patient. This is the essence of what the CMS is doing to push past Fee-for-Service, but it can be a little complicated so **I'll give an example below.**

# Capitation Example

""Capitation"" is an example of a global AND Professional contracting structure (2 birds 1 stone, baby. Respect the layered density, here). **Capitation is where medicare pays a doctor a specific monthly fee for certain patients they've been 'assigned'**. (Assigned is the literal term used, where each doctor is assigned responsibility for a certain group of patients by medicare or the insurer.) This means **THE RISK OF THE PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE PHYSICIAN**. 

Why? Because now the physician doesn't get reimbursed for the service costs of the patient, instead they are paid each month a flat rate. **So if the patient's health is poorly managed and incurs a lot of extra fees? The Doctor now takes a financial hit.** That is the essence of a global payment plan - **Paying a global fee from a top-down perspective, and allowing all the gritty details to work themselves out under a payment structure that inherently incentivizes ""cost-saving measures"" and ""improved care"".** (This concept is being spread across multiple structures in healthcare, including medicare advantage, you may have noticed).

# What is Fee For Service

To clarify, FFS (Fee For Service) is simply that the doctor provides a service and charges a fee for doing that service (which the insurer or medicare normally pays at least partially). Direct Contracting is the program opposed to this - aggressively trying to enact 'risk sharing' measures like capitation. **Although the CMS is trying to move away from FFS, it's not so simple. FFS is nice and reliable for doctors, as it involves no risk for them.** They can simply provide their services, and get paid for those services.

(Side note: FFS actually does incur some risk for the Doctor, but that risk has been explained to me as ""dumbassery"" or rather ""insidiousness"", as what some insurance have tried to do is use bureaucratic means to avoid paying for services whenever they can. This is part of the ongoing issue involving ""physician-insurer tension"", which I think Clover also is poised to address very well, also. Back to FFS, though.)

**The** ***problem*** **with FFS is it incentivizes ""quantity over quality"".** The more services a doctor provides, the more they get paid, regardless of how it actually affects the patient. (Both CLOV wiki and the CMS DCE page explain this well). What FFS peeps will tell you is they are actually ""well regulated"" and there are many preventative measures in place.

However, these measures are extensive and legalistic - making them *convoluted and difficult to stay on top of*. **So when you realize all these elaborate legalistic measures are in place** ***because the underlying payment structure is skewed towards perverse incentive -*** **that is when you start to see why some of this stuff is so innovative and why moving away from FFS altogether is reasonable.**

# What is an ACO

Another term to address is 'ACO'. ACO stands for Accountable Care Organization. **It's a global payment structure**, but it's not just physicians who participate. An ACO can span hospitals, doctor groups, specialists, etc. And when these groups partner up with medicare or an insurance company, **they engage in something like 'MSSP' - which stands for 'Medicare Shared Savings Program'**. I'll explain with an example.

The idea is this. The ACO (let's say it's just one hospital, for simplicity) is responsible for a group of patients. Medicare says to the hospital 'last year the population you covered cost around $400 *per member per month*'. So one person costs $400 a month on average that medicare has to pay to the hospital. Entering an ACO agreement, Medicare or an insurer says ""We will pay you a flat rate of $400 a month per member, and if you can get the cost *below* that, we will split the savings."" So if the hospital is able to reduce costs to $390, $5 goes to the hospital and $5 goes to the insurer. Obviously, spanning that across 10,000 patients - you earned an extra $50,000 for your doctors. So by taking on risk (again, that risk being the population could exceed the target price of $400), you were rewarded by reducing cost.

# Clover Assistant is Perfect for This

**Direct contracting will build on this model. And I think the Clover Assistant is almost perfectly built for this.** Where an insurer such as United Health will engage an ACO, and contract efficiently on their side to then allow a hospital to do its own thing and cut costs where it can, **Clover Health is actually set up to** ***collaborate*** **on cost-saving by offering the Clover Assistant to help ensure the population is well managed and both parties can share in the savings. It's absolutely a win-win - and it's set up so both the doctor and Clover share in the savings.**

Think of this especially if you're a smaller doctor group. You're told you have to cut costs, but you're not some hospital that has the resources to track that on a grand scale and implement systematic changes. **How can you also participate?** Well, Clover Assistant gathers data across a much larger group of patients, tracking their data, and uses machine learning to provide actionable data. Now, even a smaller doctor group without extensive patient data can maximize their savings and the health of their population.

# HOW THE CMS INCENTIVIZES CHANGE:

This is super important in my mind and is one of the main reasons I'm really bullish on CLOV in the relatively near term. CMS talks a lot about how Direct Contracting allows providers to 'take on risk and receive rewards'. The rewards part is what I'm most interested in.

Back in 2015, some doctors were still using paper for patient reports and diagnoses. The CMS was like ""Aye, that's not efficient - it adds burden to the system and most of ya'll write like shit. Fuck you"". So to incentivize doctors to use electronic medical records, they said ""If you use electronic medical records and include a certain degree of detail, we will pay $16,000 to EACH doctor who meets our requirement."" Now, you may be unaware of this - but usually doctor's want money. And $16,000 is an exorbitant amount.

So everyone gets on board, of course, and starts using electronic records. Now the next year comes around, and this time medicare says ""we will still reward you for using electronic records, but now only $7,500 per doctor' and also the list of requirements a doctor has to fulfill gets longer. Of course, everyone agrees because they're already doing the majority of the requirements from last year. The following year the rewards diminish and the list of requirements lengthens, and now in 2021 the reward is literally $0, and everyone uses electronic health records **and the system is more efficient**.

This is what happens if you collaborate with the CMS on where they're trying to push for specific changes that benefit the system long term. They reward you well, especially in the beginning, and as you get more efficient and the system improves, those rewards get more strict. **Personally, I think that is absolutely perfect for a growth company like Clover Health.** If you're trying to get off the ground with growth outside your established states, the CMS is the road to that. They can get you on track for growth, and reward your efforts to improve the space (significant especially in the beginning, which is when you need it most as a growth company). Because Clover is newer, it can be more flexible in its alignment with the CMS, **while many much larger companies (United Health and Humana) are going to find it more difficult to shift from FFS -** ***as that is the default and rooted position.***

(Listen to the podcast I linked in the beginning - the CMS is moving swiftly and despite some outcry that they *are moving too fast*, they continue to go ahead with their 'geo model', which eliminates FFS altogether in select regions.)

That is what I think will be the great underlying wave that will allow them to expand and take market share from much larger insurers. **By aligning their aims with the CMS, Clover will have the opportunity to be rewarded early on and prepare for the long road ahead.**

# Conclusion

This is a changing time in healthcare, and I frankly believe Clover is positioned incredibly well to take advantage of it. This stock is more than just a couple of catalysts or a pump and dump. And I'm pretty excited about it.

However our brain is stupid. Winning/Losing a lot of money in a short period of time needs a reason. Even though the real explanation is luck. 

Ask yourself this question: Whatever you are calculating and drawing on the graphs, couldn’t that being automated by some of the smartest data scientists in the world? If that’s the case it goes two ways:
1. It is a good strategy, and the ones who apply it first will make a lot of money (those connected with fiber cables directly to the market, not you), and you will be buying and selling after them every time giving them your money. 
2. The strategy is random horse shit and you are just paying trading fees unnecessarily often. 

In my opinion TA should be considered casino. Not because „haha sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some“, but because you will actually lose over the long term and the only ones winning are the exchanges, or Hedge Funds with their supercomputers.

I really think there should be some sort of enforcement against misleading TA, which is in my opinion any TA.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Q1 March 2021- EPS of $0.09 (200% increase)- Revenue of $89.8 million (36% increase).- They also announced that they are now debt-free.

The company said it expects 2021 revenue of $390.0 million to $410.0 million. The company's previous guidance was revenue of $370.0 million to $380.0 million and the current consensus revenue estimate is $375.56 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. This guidance also does not include travel-related advertising revenue which could come 'flying' back at any moment. This influx of revenue that is not being accounted for in guidance could easily send FY 2021 revenue much closer to $500M.

Considering their current TTM rev is already $328M and their FY 2021 will very likely be in the range of $400-420M, how is their market cap SO low?

As of today their market cap sits at $569M ($16.73 Share Price on 33.85M Shares Outstanding). Given that this company is debt-free, profitable, and growing at a steady rate should the market cap and P/S ratio not begin to catch up with other players in ad tech the sector?

n4e3w6,,stocks,post,1620095913,"Why is NVDA worth so much more than AMD?I'm newer to the game so maybe someone can help me with this.  I am sure I am missing something basic but, looking at their revenue, NVDA is not much more than AMD.  NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  

I like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated.","['AMD', 'NVDA']"
n4e3w6,gwv44a2,stocks,comment,1620097300,"Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:

Revenue:

NVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)

Gross Profit:

NVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)

Income Before Taxes:

NVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).

Net Income:

NVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).

So what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.","['AMD', 'NVDA']"

NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.

At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. 

After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. 

TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD.","['INTC', 'AMD', 'NVDA']"

n53c5b,,stocks,post,1620176355,"REITs vs inflation?I don't want to discuss a certain REIT. Just the idea in general.

At first glance, Real Estate Investment Trusts seem like a good play if you expect the cost of real estate to go up and the value of the dollar to go down. You *should* see regular distributions while the underlying assets increase in value. Theoretically.

HOWEVER, after putting some thought into it: do you really think the book value of the underlying assets really translate to realized gains in a timely manner? The idea behind these REITs is long-term leases. 20 year leases. 30 years. Maybe more! Just because the property is worth more doesn't mean that gets passed along to the clients. They agreed to a x% increase per year regardless whether that real estate appreciates in value or not. Their pricing leverage is severely hindered in that these properties might not be up for renegotiation for another 10-15 years!

So, anyway, I just wanted to see what others thinks. I'm not convinced REITs will do better than the rest of the market in high-inflation times. In fact, I'd be worried that they are actually more vulnerable. I'm sure I'm missing a lot, but I'd like to see how the rest of you think on this topic",

Maybe you took more risk than you wanted to. Maybe you put too much in a risky position. Maybe you bought into the hype. Maybe you thought with your heart and said ""[insert company] will never go away so it must go up!""

Well, you're here now. What's your plan?

**COME UP WITH A PLAN**

Good investors come up with plans. They don't sell on red days or green days. They sell when something happens that changes their initial reasons for buying.

Are you going to hold forever? Are you selling before earnings? Are you selling if it gets to whatever price? Are you going to keep buying? 

You must have a plan. Once you have this plan...

**STICK TO THE PLAN**

Do not deviate. Don't say ""maybe it will come back up"" or ""maybe it will come back down"". Sticking to your plan is crucial. This is how you can manage your risk. It doesn't matter what happens in the next day or week or year. You did what you thought was the best action to take in the moment because you stuck to your plan. In time, you will tweak your plan to maximize your potential and minimize your downside. Don't look back at a position and feel great or bad. Just evaluate whether you made the right decision based on the information you were working with at the time.

**TAKE YOUR EMOTIONS OUT OF THE EQUATION**

Do you think Warren Buffett panics every time there's a red day? Absolutely not. Then why should you? If you let your emotions get the best of you, you WILL do something stupid. The stock market does not care, so why should you?

There are going to be many red days ahead. Are you ready for them?

I’m almost positive it is unfair to compare EPS across companies as different companies will have different numbers of shares, and while one company may have more earnings, they may have many more outstanding shares so it is unfair to compare the two with EPS.
Now when we calculate P/E ratio, we do stock price / EPS. My question is why is it now fair to use the EPS when we add the stock price in to the equation to compare the two companies.

n4od6o,gwwl69e,stocks,comment,1620135370,Because now you’re looking at what the value of earnings is PER share vs what you’re paying for each share. So buying a $10 EPS company isn’t better than buying a $2 EPS company if the share price for the first company is $200 and the share price for the second company is $3 ... You’re getting $2 of earnings for $3 vs getting $10 of earnings for $200 - so by looking at EPS in the context of price per share it gives you a better understanding of what you’re getting for what you’re paying. It’s still not a standalone metric though and you should always do more research as to why a companies P/E is different than another - there’s a lot you can’t tell by just looking at ratios,

n4u0o3,,stocks,post,1620149116,"Short selling against the boxI recently learned about short selling against the box and since most people don't know what this means I thought some of you might benefit from my mistake.  


**What is Short selling against the box?**   
This happens when you have a long position and you short it while keeping your long. For example, if you own 10 shares of TSLA and you short 3 and don't sell your long - you create a boxed short. *This means your broker can close out you out of your short position at any time if they need to cover the shorts they have from other accounts for X reasons.* Not only that but my broker not just covered my short but also sold the equal amount of longs to cover my short even though I had cash to cover it. At the end of the day this means I was left with 7 shares without ever have any control of it how it was executed. Lastly, you could hold that short for months and months without anything ever happening but as soon as the broker needs to cover other shorts they will close your boxed position. I held mine for almost 9 months without anyone saying anything or any alert being shown communicating it would be closed out at any time.

**Why is this prohibited?**   
From a broker standpoint they use this rule to have liquidity to cover their shorts at any time needed including if you actually own those shares. From a tax standpoint, before 1997 you could have used a box short as a way to avoid paying taxes on your gains for a period of time.

**How to circumvent this rule?**  
Create a separate account and hold the short there. If you only have a short position it's not considered a box position.

I’ve heard before “you know the stock markets in trouble when the shoe shine boy is giving you stock tips” - well we are already there obviously. 

But what about when the shoe shine boy is predicting a market crash? 

Did everyday people ever see other major market events before or as they were happening? If no, that makes me curious if fears from plebs would mean there is actually nothing to fear. Thoughts?",
n4wvv8,gwxzr06,stocks,comment,1620159846,"As the others have said, the big problem is timing - you’ve seen The Big Short right? Well for every one of those guys, there were 10 people saying in 2003/04/05/06 that there was a bubble and a crash was due in a few weeks/months. Similarly people have been saying since 2015 that this bull market is going to come to a crashing end.

Not saying that those guys were idiots by any means, in fact a lot of them were very smart (and had solid economic data to back up their theory) - the problem is the market is as much investor psychology as it is economics. It’s like a game of musical chairs - the bull market will continue until it doesn’t.

I guess the closest thing to “everyday people” predicting the crash were the 2 young guys (Charlie and Jamie) from the Big Short, and also another guy Andrew Lahde from 2008. But again, for every one of them there were 10 guys who either missed out on huge returns by saying back in 2004 the bull market was over, or worse shorted the market and got wiped out.

>Peloton recalled its Peloton Tread+ and Peloton Tread treadmills today, according to an [announcement from the Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury), the government agency that oversees most household products, citing safety hazards.  
>  
>The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”  
>  
>**The company also notified the CPSC that its newer Peloton Tread’s touch screen can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.**  
>  
>**Consumers should immediately stop using the treadmills and** [**contact Peloton for a full refund**](https://www.onepeloton.com/)**.**  
>  
>**The Peloton Tread+ (previously named the Peloton Tread) has been on the market since 2018. A smaller treadmill, also named the Peloton Tread, was slated to go on sale May 27, with 1,000 units already sold in the U.S. as part of a friends-and-family presale.**   
>  
>The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
>  
>**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
>  
>In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.   
>  
>The treadmill’s safety risks first became apparent in March after [Peloton CEO John Foley wrote to](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-) users of the exercise machines regarding an incident with the Peloton Tread+ that led to the death of a child. Foley advised consumers to “keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times” and to “remove the safety key and store it out of reach of children” when the treadmill was not in use.  
>  
>The widely publicized fatality prompted the CPSC to request information from Peloton, and the company disclosed to the agency that there were additional injuries and incidents tied to the Peloton Tread+.  
>  
>**As the CPSC investigated the reports, including disturbing** [**home video footage of a child being sucked underneath the Peloton Tread+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) **(and escaping without serious injury), the agency asked Peloton to recall its treadmills. But Peloton refused.**  
>  
>Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
>  
>The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
>  
>“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
>  
>Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
>  
>**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families. I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”**

With talks of looming inflation, and the rotation into value, inflation-protected, and ""reopening"" oriented stocks, I figure more than a few people are looking to adjust their portfolios a bit, and may have some similar questions.

Something I had not heavily considered before now are the advantages of futures compared to equity in the producers of a commodity. Say ETNs / ETVs like JJC or CPER vs. an ETF like COPX.

I'm curious what advantages there are behind going either route, or for some insight behind why one might pick one over the other in the current economic landscape.",

n5jbxh,,investing,post,1620230375,"Limiting turnover in levered portfoliosAfter spending a bit too much time reading  ~~papers~~ marketing pieces from AQR, I'm fully convinced that a ""balanced portfolio"" (ie less stocks, more bonds and alts than the 100/0) levered up to the risk of stocks should beat the pants off everyone's favourite 100/0 while cutting the tails somewhat, even with realistic financing costs and transaction costs  (cursory look at Alpha Architect's ~~material~~ sales pitches for high turnover products)

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

Or am I missing something else entirely?",['ES']

To offset the volatility drag of leveraged ETFs, you'd end up just deleveraging to where there's no point in doing this over a non-leveraged portfolio.

To adjust your leverage in some smart way, you'd need to be able to guess beta right most of the time. That's as impossible trying to guess alpha.",
n5lead,,investing,post,1620235477,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor  
**Resolution 2:** I made 3 copies of the sheet in hopes of spreading out the odds of getting in  
   [Copy 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_UjmNI7Zxm76QN3HQ-_cwx3lZ8QbTogyqYTY1oRC9E/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDRkAGtRrXql5RQ-l68cD5lE3XoBMNv3oJsHb_3JK38/edit?usp=sharing)
3. **Resolution 3:** I published them to the web for those that can't get into the files themselves  
   [Link 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml), [Link 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNy-pbbipZSMcp3ppBMuDik0hGqh1iqg6yLi1p22IHFsh2VtJgXn_l3LmqX0KUAu-WkhHxYve0jP4i/pubhtml), [Link 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS0i8hyUhW08s6_coWXjnV593xDipk5ttZJq3yB3heqXF92HMspHU5-gvD4q8cTsiA7TehjeAobCayH/pubhtml)
4. **Resolution 4:** Create downloadable Excel copies. These are locked in at 05/05/21 so won't be updated after that, but I left instructions to update it yourself

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

Assumptions:

* There is one intergalactic market that contains *everything* of value
* The market includes a risk-free asset (though I don't believe this is truly a requirement for this conclusion)
* I can buy an infinitesimal amount of anything and everything in the market
* Everyone knows everything about everything in the market, and they've traded with such liquidity that the value of everything in the market has been determined exactly
* The market portfolio is the sum of everything in the market
* We're in a frictionless vacuum, and cows are spherical

Then, the market portfolio is the best mean/variance portfolio: if a higher Sharpe ratio portfolio existed, then *everyone* would recognize this and use it, changing the prices in the market, making the portfolio worse than or equivalent to the market portfolio.

And if I wanted to invest in the market portfolio, I would buy a fractional share of the market, the components of which would then be weighted by their value in the market (their market capitalization)

I hope I'm wrong, I  but it made me nervous because I do have quite a bit of cash on hand (10k+) that I'm holding to find an investment opportunity. Here's what I found with a bit of research:

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?  If its entire attraction is its insane volatility how is it useful for its primary purported utility—currency—when it lacks the things a currency must have, namely stable store of value and standard of value (you're going to convert it back into a government backed security at some point)?",

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?","['HD', 'ADBE', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'UNP', 'HON', 'UNH', 'TGT', 'DIS', 'TMO', 'SPGI', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'DHR', 'NVDA', 'NKE']"

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

The tl;dr is that the price of an ETF is determined by the market.

This means that the price of the ETF can never deviate too far from the value implied by prices of the underlying shares.",
n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['IP', 'TSLA', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'AAPL']"

I know it's had a history of some spectacular failures, but it seems to me like it could be ""close enough"" to clean energy, while being easily able to meet large scale sustained demand. Though it's cooling needs seem to frequently run up against climate change issues.

I've seen some talk about uranium commodities, but fringe commodities seem unattractive to me because they frequently have untapped mining/refining that's just waiting to spin up, so price never appreciates as much as you'd think based on demand.

n3tkix,,investing,post,1620040800,"Bullish or bearish on China / FLCH?I own some FLCH, which has some 900 holdings and a quarter of the ETF is Alibaba and Tencent, however the ETF value has been stagnating. I am considering liquidating and putting my money into VTI to ride thIs wave. But this is my dilemma:

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful. I obviously regret not putting that money into VTI as my logic (at the time) was that the global recovery will be lead by China:,and since China is the biggest trading partner for some 130+ countries, the ETF will recover nicely.

Now, with political tensions (delisting included) and increasing risks of a new cold war, I'm thinking it may stagnate for the next year or so while VTI climbs. But knowing my luck I suspect that if I do so, VTI will then slow down (stimuli already priced-in) and FLCH will take off.

n3jkda,,investing,post,1620000972,"Retail Dragon Portfolio - Week 1 UpdateFirst weekly update on the Retail Dragon Portfolio. A new screenshot can be found [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jSahhfA).

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Chris Cole's Dragon Portfolio Allocations](https://imgur.com/gallery/0JVrDkm)
* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI']

n3e4va,,investing,post,1619984402,"Water ETFs ? 2040 water shortage what water ETFs are out there to buy?Community Water Corporation Agreement Example

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

n44y45,gwtm292,investing,comment,1620071767,"There's a lot of regulatory / political uncertainty surrounding GEO and the prison space right now. The Biden executive order has directed the DOJ to cease use of private facilities which is acting as a headwind to revenue and contract renewal rates. Losing the Bureau of Prison business via the executive order isn't that big of a deal, but it does represent ~$290MM of revenue rolling off between now and FYE2022. More concerning, however, was having the contract with the US Marshals canceled at the GEO Queens facility as this customer was viewed as far more sticky than the BOP. Losing the BOP revenue was always a matter of ""when"", not ""if"", but potentially losing the USMS in addition means GEO investors need to diligence how the company will navigate losing two of its top three customers.

Increasing chatter of reform at ICE layers in additional concerns as this is their largest customer, though it isn't clear to me how the USMS and ICE will rapidly move away from the industry with any degree of efficiency, particularly as COVID impacts on prison and ICE populations abate. While the asset value at GEO is robust, keep in mind there is limited use for these assets. A prison can't be converted into a shopping mall or a bowling alley, for example, and at GEO you have a lot of debt ahead the equity that would be paid out first in the event of a liquidation. While it likely makes sense for the government to solve the prison prison ""problem"" by buying these assets for public use given the constraints in the government prison system, for political reasons this may not happen.

Add on top of all of this is GEO's limited ability to tap capital markets due to ESG concerns (though this is a constantly moving line) + GEO's 2024 maturity wall and it doesn't strike me as a great equity story. Limited paths for growth, regulatory concerns, questionable access to capital, refi risk, etc, etc. Eliminating the dividend was a good first step but long over due. Given yield on GEO's debt I would prefer to buy the near term bonds than the equity.

Personally I like CoreCivic better than GEO. Less leverage, better story, less BOP risk, but neither strikes me as a compelling equity opportunity.

TLDR: tough equity story; this is not a ""down the fairway"" stock as it is borderline distressed; lots of revenue is rolling off and even more is at risk of rolling off in the future rendering current P/E metrics rather useless; limited opportunities for growth in general as prison populations have been in decline for years now",['ICE']

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile. 

Is it not commonplace to view growth stocks as more volatile than value? Was this view different 15 years ago?",['BLL']

However, I’m not even sure your statement holds today, as we can easily flip it. We say we view growth as more risky, but how many people are throwing large investments into renewables or EVs?  The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth. 

People tend to extrapolate recent past performance into the future and view recent decline to indicate continuing decline and recent success to indicate continuing success.",

As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

Why not!? If you think inflation is going to keep climbing I don't see how the 30 year yield can remain low. 3% doesn't even represent a normal level of term spread even at low inflation levels. If inflation remains stable or continues to increase the 30 year yield has to continue going up just to maintain a positive expected return much less keep up with historical term spread.",

Well Powell keeps saying transitory rather than temporary because temporary implies it does away. Transitory means it is a one time bump. Once inflated the Fed and the treasury do not expect a decline in prices but lower future inflation.

I've been in gold and silver since last spring/summer. I don't think it will rise that much due to alternatives like crypto (which I sadly did not buy into last spring/summer), the strength of equities, and how bullish economies coming out of a recession tend for boom industrial materials/metals rather than defensive ones like silver/gold. Not saying it can't rise on inflation, but gold/silver are highly speculative so a strong global economy could offset the inflationary gains of precious metals.",

A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['TSLA', 'TWTR', 'SPGI', 'DOW']"

n2uok0,,investing,post,1619913292,"İnflation nothing changedNothing has changed over the past week. The Fed remains dovish, and in spite of its transitory speak about inflation, prices continue to soar. Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

I wish I had more to say , but who wants to hear a running post on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, and given the long slow grind lower following the slingshot to 2100 in Goldand 40 silver , I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

This is why they are leading with mustangs/trucks and not Lincoln, honestly, when was the last time you saw someone under 50 willingly drive a Lincoln? The branding isn’t there.

Also Michigan is a right-to-work state and union membership has been declining because of this in recent years (or in this case, growing at a slower rate than the size of the auto industry). Some of the points you made are valid, but electrifying their truck line is a no-brainer when they were humiliated by Tesla's Cybertruck in a towing demonstration. (Argue about the validity of the Cybertruck vs F150 test until the cows come home, it was still an effective piece of marketing).

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.  What happened late January is shorts mostly became super correlated, and things get dangerous fast.",['AAL']

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

Invest at your own risk. The above scenario is incredibly risky and a slight deviation in your math will bankrupt your account, but if correct, it’s a big payday and scaleable with a ton of margin if you choose that risk.",
n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA. Ironically this probably sets up a good entry to short bubble stocks, of which there are plenty. Be careful of ones with weekly expiries and high short interest; these are prone to gamma manipulation by larger players. It's a game and if there is money to be made in a short squeeze it will be done. 

There is stuff like ARKK which doesn't necessarily have 0 fundamentals but has very high valuations; SPACs which are mostly frauds (e.g. NKLA), meme stocks like MVIS and GME. Go for put spreads instead of outright shorting if you can find a good entry. 

You could go for a more balanced approach and diversify your short book. Solely from valuation you can short MSFT/APPL against long GOOG/FB and I reckon there are many more interesting pairs out there. But there is so much money on the table if the bubble stocks do burst. The call-buying from retail is slowly diminishing as the economy is reopening up; interest rates are rising and I think this is probably a good opportunity to set up some shorts if you can stomach large drawdowns (and you do need conviction to believe that stocks will trade towards their fair value over time).","['ARKK', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'FB']"

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']"

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",

n13d9f,,investing,post,1619699725,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval ProcessWelcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

This is a general overview of the FDA drug approval process. I hope this has been informative to some and if so, I may try to write some more quick guides in the future regarding pharmaceuticals.",['DISH']

n0k1xc,,investing,post,1619630884,"Why REITs Are in a position to outperform equities on a risk-adjusted basis1. The corporate tax hike will affect most corporations, but REITs are ""pass through"", so they will be unaffected by this as they do not pay corporate taxes.

2. The capital gains and qualified dividend tax hike won't affect REITs either, because they're already taxed as ordinary income(other than QBI deduction)

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

4. Real estate has historically done well during periods of inflation, and many leading indicators for inflation are present(High commodity prices, shortages, high demand, stimulus, M2 growth, unemployment dropping, rising inflation expectations)

5. REITs have yet to recover as much in share price as much as the equity market. While equities are trading at far higher P/E ratios than they were a year ago, REITs FFO to price ratios are still looking cheap.

6. If you look at 1999 when equities were starting to trade at similar P/E Ratios, REITs went on to perform well during the tech bubble crash up until the real estate bubble several years later.

7. Low interest rates present an opportunity for leveraged investment",

n1awok,,investing,post,1619721222,"Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings Apple is a great long term buy according to my opinion. My Portfolio is 100% Apple. I believe this company has so many more avenues to venture into and maintain healthy growth over the following decade. I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",['AAPL']

But this is the best and most important part? If you don't want to get into your DD then how about amusing me a bit with these questions:

* How do feel about the risk of weak returns since Brazil has been in a decade of economic down turn? Historically Brazil has had booms that market them look like they'll reach developed status only to bust back into developing status.

* Have you factored in the problems with inflation and continued currency weakness? US might be printing like crazy, but LatAm currencies are experiencing inflation not only against their own goods/services but also against the dollar.

* Are you factoring the various troubles of Bolsonaro government having immediate and long term impacts?

* How are you so sure those individual stocks will do so well? Investing in Brazil is already risky as is with it likely being outside the circle of competence of most people. The added individual stock picks only increases those risks. Why not invest in an ETF like EWZ?

* What makes you think that these Brazilian stocks or even a Brazilian ETF can outperform US stocks when historically speaking the US & S&P has beaten Brazil and the Brazilian top stocks in basically every time range be it 1yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, or 50yr?

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”","['TEL', 'WHR', 'DOV', 'KO', 'DE', 'SNA', 'PEP', 'CE']"

* Great studios are very far and few. To develop something like the Witcher series and gain such widespread critical acclaim is not easy. It takes a lot of money, talent, and momentum to be able to build such competence as a developer, that's valuable.
* Essentially CD Projekt Red benefits from being HQ'd in Eastern Europe. These games require an army to develop. Well, eastern developers are a cheap and talented army.
* The games of today are services, they are not one-off products. Cyber Punk will be improved upon, and over time the developers will hash out all the bugs and the game will improve.
* The best time to release a new IP is during the release of a new generation of consoles. It matters less whether the game is any good, the key is to make the IP a thing (one game is not the IP). As far as I am concerned, every gamer has heard of this IP now. All it takes are some critical reviews of the next installments to completely change the media storyline.
* CD Projekt Red made all of Cyber Punk's development costs back before the game was even released in preorders. They are far from losing money at this point.",['IP']
n133p8,,investing,post,1619698785,"DD: Mother's Day is May 9th - Go Get Her Some Nice $FLWS1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March & September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA & ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

I’ve been holding a couple hundred shares of Alibaba for a little while and last night while I was browsing yahoo finance I noticed that the price target range had been lifted from $220-$350 to $1000-$2500 and almost had a heart attack from the excitement. I know that price targets are just guessed, but I was very happy to see what seemed to be an incredibly positive outlook on the mid-term future of the stock by almost 50+ analysts.

Of course people focus on the 10% who get lucky and outperform the average but there is 0 future expectation that they will continue outperformance.

n0alci,gw8whb3,investing,comment,1619660842,"I am 33 years old married man with my first baby on the way in July. My wife and I have about 55K in a High Yield Savings Account, however with interest rates going down, the return has been pretty poor. Looking to move some of the money to some higher growth accounts. I also have about 45K in different ETFs and Stocks (Robhinhood & Stash...mostly tech, blue chip stock)

My wife and I both work full time. Combined annual income is around 200K.

We currently own a house and want to grow our money for savings/retirement. There is no plan for a big purchase, maybe a new house in a few years but likely would use the profits from our current house for a down payment. It really would just to be grow the money for retirement.

I don't mind being a risky, my wife is more conservative however. She thinks the $17 we get a month from our savings account is a big win. 

I currently max out my 401K and have about 80K in there right now. (Started a little late maxing it out)

I do not have an IRA . 

Don't have a ton of debt, maybe 1K on a credit card and I lease my car. My wife's car is paid off.

I just opened an E\*trade Core Portfolio account to transfer 15K of that 55K into it to hopefully grow. Should I go this route or are there better options to grow my money? If I invest it in an IRA can I take it out at any time or will I get taxed if I take it out before 59.5? My father passed away at 60 so I'd rather spend my money earlier in life.

mzn9py,,investing,post,1619526251,"What do you think broad market returns will average over the next 20 years?When retirement planning or just choosing between different investment opportunities we all have to make some assumptions about what the long-term broad market outlook is. With a difference of 2% growth rates over the next 20 years there can be massive differences in the end value of your investment.


The historical CAGR (with dividends) of the S&P500 over the last X years (ending Dec 31 2020) is as follows:

100 Years: 10.46%

90: 9.92%

80: 11.23%

70: 11.54%

60: 10.27%

50: 10.76%

40: 12.01%

30: 10.24%

20: 6.59%

10: 13.99%

Source: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm


Knowing this, what do you assume the broad market will have for an annualized growth rate over the next 20 years or so? I'm thinking along the lines of the total S&P500 return, VTSAX, or similar. Why?


I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more. Second, I think macroeconomic headwinds are coming compared to the previous decades that will result in slower overall growth.",['SPGI']
mzn9py,gw2hafy,investing,comment,1619541843,"For what it's worth, despite many on Reddit saying it would be a wild guess, the idea of forecasting returns within a rough degree of accuracy is pretty well accepted in mainstream finance.  After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

There's a bunch more, obviously, but those are some highlights.  I would encourage anyone who genuinely wants to absorb some information to read the [full report](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/ltcma-full-report.pdf).  It's a bit long, but it's full of fantastic insights.

E: it should be noted that JPM isn't the only institution doing this - most banks release similar reports, even the fan favorite Vanguard has long term market assumptions that largely reflect these, and so did Jack Bogle before his passing.  The reason I mention it is to note that the idea of return forecasting isn't some sort of crazy complex finance marketing - it's just an execution of some basic macroeconomics and math.",['JPM']

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -> Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -> Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-> Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-> Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook & Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

Is this realistic to attempt a valuation going backwards on Price/Sale ratio?

Nobody uses sales or revenue to determine price because of all the accounting sleight of hand that affects these figures.  This is why operating cash flow is central to securities pricing.

Operating income has been negative for five straight years.  Operating cash flow has been negative for four of the last five years.

Via free cash flow, you get a fair value of roughly -$40 per share.

If two identical people had taken all of their disposable income and savings and one put it into SF property and the other SPY, who would have come out ahead?

For the sake of concreteness, lets say the one investing in SF Real Estate lived in the house, whereas the one investing in SPY paid an equal amount of rent to the Mortgage of the SF property, but without Property taxes.

To be clear, this is not asking what a viable investment strategy is, or if it's smart to invest like in the examples above. 

This is strictly asking about the outcome value-wise of the above two options",['SPGI']

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this? 

I don't wanna seem conspiratorial but it'd seem that most institutional investors have a vested interest in holding GE. 

More worryingly, the only coverage about the aftermath I can find, seems to be taken down: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-25/it-s-almost-like-the-shock-ge-short-thesis-never-happened

mz77xi,,investing,post,1619469066,"New guidelines for DD posts**This is a follow up to /u/Greytoc's post here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mw4jei/psa_stock_promotion_and_suspicious_stock/

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.     

Unrelated: We've eased up the automod constraints on advice/beginner posts to hopefully encourage more complex questions to come through.",

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR']

From the perspective of somebody that actually holds crypto in a wallet, not one that just speculates on it on robinhood, how would everything you hold and every transaction you ever make be in any way beneficial?

The combined company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CVS.” The Aetna brand name will continue to be used in reference to the health insurance products. Going forward, Aetna will operate as a standalone business within the CVS Health enterprise and will be led by members of its current management team.

It says it did not issue any fractional shares, but how was shareholders of Aetna given 0.8378 share of CVS? where did the share come from?",['CVS']

I'm looking to invest in some real estate and it definitely feels like we're in a bubble. But is the conventional wisdom about the same? Is it generally better to just invest now vs. waiting for a dip?

However, I disagree with both. I think you can time both, but it's really about making sure you're not overpaying for assets.

For example, if you look in the stock market you will find some stocks that are still a good value despite the overall market 100% being in a bubble. The same goes for real estate. There are probably some real estate markets that will grow quite well over the next 5-10 years. I'm thinking the states where there is no income tax is a good example of good markets in general.

mym15t,,investing,post,1619398704,"Tax it now? Or tax it later?I’ve always heard the order of investing for retirement should go as follows:
Contribute to Employer Tax Deferred Plan up to the match amount
Max out Roth IRA
Back to Employer Plan and max it out
Contribute to Taxable accounts

That’s what we’ve been working on for the last three years. My wife has a 403(b) and a Roth IRA. I haven’t had an employee plan, so I’ve just been maxing out my Roth IRA and that’s it. 

I know the assumption people rely on for this plan is that their tax bracket in retirement will be higher than what it is now, hence taking the taxes now in lieu of taking them in retirement. 

I just got a job that offers a SIMPLE IRA (tax deferred account similar to 401(k)) with a 3% employer match. 

Our adjusted gross income last year (married filing jointly) was around 95k. 

Is this still the right plan to follow? Or should things be switched around and focus more on tax deferred plans? And other than just pure opinion or things you’ve heard before, what’s the reason for what you’re suggesting?",

mym15t,gvxb4h5,investing,comment,1619442134,"The advice you've outlined is pretty common in /r/personalfinance which tends to be skewed to young, early career, or pre-career demographics or people working in a career with limited/stagnated earnings. Roth is a good option for these workers because they tend to be in lower tax brackets now, but with potential for higher income in the future and in retirement. Additionally, Roth IRA's allow removal of contributions (but not growth) without penalty which provides flexibility in how the money is used which younger workers value. 

If you're an older, professional, mid/late career worker, in a career where earnings tend to increase with experience and responsibility, you will tend to get more benefit from pre-tax account contributions. These workers tend to be in higher tax brackets and have income that exceeds their planned retirement income. These workers should prioritize 401k, HSA. Deductible IRA contributions generally are not an option due to the low income cap. 

The rule of thumb I've seen is that if you're in the bottom two tax brackets you should prioritize after-tax accounts (Roth, Roth 401k). If you're above the bottom two tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax (401k, HSA) and after maxing these, use Roth IRA, then taxable accounts.",

mydjye,gvxq9vn,investing,comment,1619449452,"Look, you are free to disregard this, but I'm hoping to save you a lot of pain.  For what it's worth, I'm currently the CEO of a biotech startup that's raised $30MM.

If you don't meet the accredited investor definition (by wealth, not certification) and you're not playing an active role in managing whatever you're looking at investing in, at least one of the following are true: you should not be investing in that business, and if that business is interested in having you as an investor, *nobody* should be investing in it.

The rules are there to protect investors who can't afford to lose significant amounts of money from high-risk, illiquid investments where there are significant information gaps between investors and management due to the lack of formal reporting.  It's not just that you're risking money that may disappear; it's that you're doing it without the ability to have the market setting the price, analysts reviewing financials, and real due diligence.

Moreover, the rules are there because, to have you as an investor, these companies need you to invest *a lot* *more* than you could lose comfortably if you don't meet the thresholds.  When I raised the seed into my current company, minimum investment was $50k.  I wanted a clean cap table with investors who wouldn't be pinched if it took a long time to get out (on average, that's 5-10 YEARS) and who knew what they were signing up for.  A company who is ok with someone investing $5k-$10k that isn't a founder and is marginally accredited either a) isn't raising enough money to scale; b) is going to have a very messy cap table; or c) is delusional or lying about capital needs or business potential.  Likely all three.

If you want to get involved with exciting startup investments, go be a part of an exciting startup.  Start one yourself, or find some founders and offer to help, or just get a job at a startup.  But if you're not accredited, you shouldn't be investing in these things -- the potential for loss is massive and you're not going to have enough firepower or financial ballast to make much of a difference or weather the rough times.",

There have been many weird changes to our lives over the last year—no longer is it considered lazy to have everything delivered to your door, travelling one suburb away now feels like a vacation, and weed has been deemed essential.

But let’s not forget about the shoes. Comfort has come first, with sneakers the new staple and high heels a relic of the past. And it’s not just Air Jordans that have been on everyone’s feet the past year, apparently. 

The rubber clog that people either love or hate has also been a pandemic favourite. Yep, we’re talking about Crocs. The polarizing footwear, which gained a cult following for its comfort and also a reputation for being aesthetically unpleasing—has been soaring on the stock market. 

The company’s shares skyrocketed 16% on Tuesday after revealing its record-breaking earnings for 2021’s first quarter and its outlook for the rest of the year. The report showed revenue for Crocs increased 64% to $460 million—the third quarter it smashed records. It also reported a net income of $98.4 million, an increase from $11.1 million the year prior. 

On the earnings call, Crocs CEO Andrew Rees said he was “incredibly optimistic” about the rest of 2021 for the company and announced that it has “substantially” raised its guidance for the year.

Why Crocs, why now?

Crocs have always been a popular choice amongst healthcare workers, because of their comfort, so there’s the possibility that the rise in hours workers spent on their feet the past year could have contributed to a rise in sales.

One of the main reasons that Crocs sales are likely to have surged in the past year, though, is the shift to WFH—as anyone too embarrassed to wear their Crocs outside of the house no longer needed to.

The shoes have been making an appearance on more than living room carpets recently, though. Questlove recently stepping out onto the 2021 Oscars red carpet in a gold pair.

Justin Beiber himself has also jumped on the Crocs bandwagon, designing a new pair that comes with socks, (which Victoria Beckham said she would rather die than wear).

But even though Beckham isn’t keen on Beiber’s latest design, a lot of other people clearly were, with the shoe selling out in just 90 minutes.

So what’s next for Crocs? Will Crocs stocks continue to surge? Will investors be as polarized with investing in stocks of the company as they are about wearing the shoes? Time will only tell.

**TL;DR** \- Is the Tobacco industry a worthy investment considering their impressive free cash flow yields and usage growth in the non-Western world, despite the headwinds they face concerning regulation?

**Hello Investors!**

I originally posted this link to the ValueInvesting and UKInvesting subreddits which resulted in a good discourse around BATS and investing in the tobacco industry in general, so I'd be interested to hear your guys thoughts on the topic:

Link to qualitative and quantitative analysis on BATS above.

The stock is currently trading at levels similar to the lows of the Covid-19 crash and in the video I discuss whether I think it could be a value play, or a value trap, and also provide my intrinsic value calculation using a combination of the discounted cash flow model and future earnings multiples.

I'd appreciate it if you spared some time to take a look at the video and let me know what you think, but a couple of the points I cover are:

**Risks:**

\- The Biden administration are considering the banning of menthol cigarettes, which account for 55% of BAT's cigarette volume in the US. Furthermore, a research study estimates that banning menthol cigarettes will result in 923,000 US smokers to quit, significantly damaging BAT's top and bottom line.

\- There are proposals for increased regulatory action on tobacco producers to significantly reduce the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, reducing their addictiveness and again harming sales and profits.

\- A general trend of increased health consciousness and move away from traditional tobacco products, though the trend of cigarette smokers worldwide still appears to be increasing.

**Opportunities:**

Key opportunity being a move into the cannabis sector following BAT's acquisition of a 20% stake in Organigram.

New category products such as non-combustible/vaping products.

**Quantitative analysis:**

My discounted cash flow shows a potential significant upside in the stock, but using a future earnings multiple approach actually shows a significant downside, with the true intrinsic value likely falling somewhere between the two.

Whether you guys watch the video or not, I'd be interested to hear what your thoughts are on BAT.

Thanks!",

This is a daily chart of Spotify since July of 2020. The vertical dashed lines show anytime there has been an earnings release over the last 10 months. Notice that there has been an initial selloff after every earnings shown by the orange highlighted box and text shown as ""initial selloff"". This selloff generally occurs for about 1-2 weeks and then reverses hard to the upside. 

One thing to note by the green boxes showing the move up after the initial selloff is that the price always moves up past the initial earnings price. This most recent earnings move down has a ""gap"" in price which would be the initial target above around $290 if this reverses to the upside.

The last price action pattern flag has failed to break to the upside as the gains were capped at pivot at $5.94.

It looked very promising yesterday for the short term trend to change, however the price broke back below 50 EMA, prolonging the overall short term downtrend.

Dips still continue to attract buyers as the dip bottomed out at $5.70 and found some decent buying power as gains quickly retested key resistance at $6.

Somewhat decent volume was seen today at market open, both buying and selling.

Overall current price action is still managing to hold above both EMA's, above current support at $5.80.

It's important for the price to stay above this level in order to change the short trend.

We now look for another test of $6.

Indicators.

EMA's as we've said are still suggesting a downtrend to be present. But as long as the price stays confidently above $5.80, we can be expecting finally a change of the trend. Because trend is way more likely to continue than to change, that's why we are seeing another bit longer downtrend.

MACD just gave a buy signal with a second oscillator signal as a buying confirmation.

Demand indicator is very close to show bullish momentum being present, a break above 60 will do the trick, however it has to find support at afterwards in order to continue in this buying pressure.",

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and  economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near-term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already-elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

With the first string of casing set and cemented in the 6-1 well, the Company owned and operated 1000 HP rig (Jarvie-1) is drilling ahead to a target depth of 3,800 meters (12,500 feet). The 6-1 well is designed to evaluate the petroleum systems discovered in the first well (6-2) in an area of maximum thickness. These first two wells are within one of five major sub-basins of the larger, more laterally extensive, Permian aged deep Kavango basin.
The Company will take whole core, side-wall core and conduct a full logging suite of all zones of interest (conventional targets and source rocks). As with the 6-2, a comprehensive state of the art logging program over both sections will be provided by Schlumberger. In addition, a Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) will be run to enable the most accurate tie-in possible, of well data, to the 2D seismic program scheduled to commence in June, 2021.

Stabilized rice bran has a longer shelf life than un-stabilized rice bran, because it undergoes processing that inactivates an enzyme that would otherwise degrade the rice bran oil, turning it rancid. Stabilization does not affect the nutritional value of the rice bran. Consuming stabilized rice bran offers a number of health benefits, because it serves as an excellent source of essential nutrients.

Learn more about Stabilized Rice Bran by visiting RiceBran's web site. This compound goes into both human and pet food, and its oil extract has patented uses by customers.

It looks like RiceBran Technologies ($RIBT) has capitulated and set to recover its earnings high of 1.83 after dipping back to its pre-earnings level in the low 0.90 above the SMAs and VWAP.

My Watchlist For 5/5/2021 - Anti Hype, Low Risk High Reward Plays 

&#x200B;

$AES  - amazing ascending triangle that is forming. If we can keep higher lows and the same peaks - we will eventually lead to a massive breakout.

&#x200B;

$COMM - Great up trend, and we need a lower price to buy in, but when it does retract some - it will be a great buy in.

&#x200B;

$KNDI - Amazing horizontal play; IT CAN GET LOWER. So only having a support is not much but it is a very strong one at least.

&#x200B;

$LSPD - Amazing triangle is forming, if tomorrow is a bounce back day - we may see a great start to a great push up.

&#x200B;

$MXIM - Another possible ascending triangle. If we do get a good push it could easily be 5% move fairly quick, I like it.

&#x200B;

$NFE  - We want a pullback. We want to get in around $40 in my opinion. If we get a full move to resistance trendline we can easily see 25%.

&#x200B;

$NXPI - Broadening wedge so the pattern may reset soon, BUT this is an amazing trendline. Right near support as well, love it.

&#x200B;

$TXN  - I spent $150 on this stupid company's calculator... now that we got a great value, let's print and get our money back.","['AES', 'TXN', 'MXIM']"
n4qfj2,,StockMarket,post,1620140390,"SLSSF.TO Due Diligence. This is my only mining stock and I am quite bullish on it, here's why.Solaris Inc., a COPPER and GOLD mining company (can't go wrong with these assets!) in the Americas, engages in acquiring, exploring, and evaluating mineral properties. Holds 100%  interest in the Warintza copper project located in the South-Eastern Ecuador; and 75% & 80% interest in the ongoing exploration of copper porphyry in Tamarugo and Ricardo(Chilean copper belt) respectively. The company is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.

According to the company’s official press release early this year ([link](https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-announces-new-discovery-at-warintza-west-geophysics-reveal-more-extensive-porphyry-system-doubling-drill-program-to-12-rigs)): ""Solaris is pleased to announce a significant new discovery in maiden drilling at Warintza West and the first detailed geophysical survey covering its Warintza Project (“Warintza” or “the Project”) have revealed a much more extensive porphyry system than previously understood.  To meet the increased scope of resource and discovery drilling, the Company is doubling its drill program from six to 12 rigs.”  
 A report from the [geophysical](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) investigation shows that  the copper in the ground is worth four or five billion and the market cap is only 1 billion.  
Moreover, Solaris acquisition has significantly been de-risked by being fully funded and availability of drilling resources, so there is no need to worry about capital of the project.  
   
You may also be concerned about the bottom line of the Warintza project after Ecuador’s new president elect; Guillermo Lasso’s government has [full support](https://www.northernminer.com/politics/miners-await-looming-presidential-elections-in-ecuador/1003828891/) of mining projects in the country as will greatly boost the country’s economy and not rely on oil alone.

Since then I have seen 2 short reports come out  against the company and I can't seem to figure out why.

Some reasons I am looking at them:

* \- Founded by a successful Entrepreneur who sold his previous company to PayPal for $304M
* \- Seed investor is the 29th richest man in the world and he has invested in every round since
* \-  Completed a $305M raise priced 25% above the market at the time which  again was led by the 29th richest man with over $100m of his own money
* \- CRH acquisition means they will have close to or over $300M in revenue and over $50M in free cash flow
* \-  $0 debt $80m in cash?

n4u820,,StockMarket,post,1620149599,"A question about the mechanics of a short squeezeHi all

I am trying to understand how does a short squeeze work, in particular when a person shorts a stock but can't cover it when the stock prices goes up instead of going down. I still have a gap in my understanding and I thought you maybe able to help fill it.

I try to explain here:

Let's suppose we have:

1. `Person 1`
2. `Person 2`
3. `Person 3`
5. `Marker Maker`

And 10 shares of a given stock. Initially we have:

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 0      |
| `Person 2` | 0      |
| `Person 3` | 0      |
| `Market Maker` | 10 |

Then let's say `Person 1`, and `Person 2` buy 1 share each:

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 1      |
| `Person 2` | 1      |
| `Person 3` | 0      |
| `Market Maker` | 8  |

Then `Person 3` borrows 8 shares from the MM with the intention of shorting it:

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 1      |
| `Person 2` | 1      |
| `Person 3` | 8      |
| `Market Maker | 0  |

`Person 3` then sells those shares to `Person 1` and `Person 2` at the market price (4 shares to each):

| Who?     | Shares |
|----------|--------|
| `Person 1` | 5      |
| `Person 2` | 5      |
| `Person 3` | 0      |
| `Market Maker` | 0  |

Let's pretend that after sometime `Person 3` realizes that the share price will not go down and he gives up and decides to buy back the shares and return it to the Market Maker.

Irrespective of initial prices, borrow fees, etc. Let's say `Person 1` and `Person 2` only sell their shares for a certain price:

| Who?     | Price  |
|----------|--------|
| Person 1 | $420   |
| Person 2 | $69   |

Let's say `Person 3` only has $5 in his bank account. Does that mean, that the Market Maker liquidates `Person 3`, takes his $5, and then is obligated to buy the shares at
the prices set by `Person 1`, `Person 2`, with two $420 shares of `Person 1` remaining in his possession?",['GPS']
n4u820,gwxw0qi,StockMarket,comment,1620158198,"Person 3 buys options for 16 more shares from the MM, immediately exercises them, returns 8 shares, buys 5 shares each from 1 and 2, waits for price to up late as MM tries to buy shares, then finally sells them all.

Or at least, that's what the hedge funds did a few months ago when the idiots think they got squeezed.👨‍🎓👼",
n4u820,gwzg6i7,StockMarket,comment,1620184284,"You are completely missing Margin Requirements in your example.  The Broker of Person 3 that borrowed the 8 shares requires that they keep a certain amount of assets to cover their liability of the 8 borrowed shares.  On established stocks like Aapl, Msft etc the margin requirements only be 50% of the value of the stock.  In volatile stocks like GME the requirement is probably 100% (or more, on ETrade for retail investors they require you have 500% margin Requirements in order to short GME).

If at any point the price of the stock goes up enough that Person 3 doesn't have enough Assets/cash to cover the position the Broker would require they deposit more funds or buy the stock to cover their position. The Broker has to manage their risk.  They can liquidate your positions without your permission if you don't meet margin calls.

Go look at Archegos Margin Call.","['MSFT', 'AAPL']"

I've always been a gamer myself and now that I'm older and mature, (pffft) I can start to appreciate the hard work and business that goes on behind the scenes to make it all possible.

Gamesquare Esports flew over my head for a while until I did some digging into some broadcasted tournaments. Some of the biggest names you've always heard of are organized by this company to allow it to happen. Names such as Dr. D, CodeRed, League of Legends, Crossfire, Twitch, Steam and so much more. A total of 75 influencers and talent represented.

They don't quite run these entire brands themselves, but they work directly with them and their clients to bring content from across the globe to your screen that you probably spend too much time on.

Their agency CodeRed Esports runs events from scratch, hires talent and broadcasts events since 2002 such as Blizzcon, Quakecon, and the $20m The International.

Gamesquare itself was the 2018 and 2019 Esports Supporting Agency of the year.

With all that being said, market cap is well undervalued at $21M. Less than a week ago, they reported a 97% YoY Revenue growth in Q1 2021.

This can be attributed to the recent appointment of former FaZe Clan CFO as CEO of Gamesquare.

n4wfiy,,StockMarket,post,1620157893,"Why You Should Short the Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['IP', 'TSLA', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'AAPL']"

One of the very few reasons why COIN IPO was approved in the first place was so that SEC can have greater access to the crypto market in attempts to regulate some of the trading activities. They want their hands on anything that’s considered to be a high-valued lucrative asset and why wouldn’t they?

But I would imagine trying to set rules in a place that’s complete out of their jurisdiction isn’t easy to do or even possible at all besides banning the trading of crypto XYZ on exchanges. Some cryptos that I assume SEC wants off their list are cryptos that possess similar attributes of DOGE and FULLSEND. Both of these currencies have no utility values besides sticking up a middle finger to the stock/bond market. Gunk that’s currently worth 60B isn’t probably something that SEC finds appealing nor acceptable when they ransack the entire NYSE, NASDAQ, OTCQX, OTCQB and PINK market every second to find any misinformation that brings a stock up 30% in value ensuing criminal charges.

Engaging in the trading of DOGE is pretty much playing hot potato at this point and it’s a surety that there’s some level of manipulation that’s led to the current prices because obviously, the fundamentals don’t justify it.

asias in particular china produces most of industrial goods, and they need all those empty containers all over the world back but coz of fakedemic restrictions, only small amount of them came back to china. this has caused shipping rate to double.

also, air freight is fucked also due to fakedemic. majority of air freight was actually carried by commercial liners. with international air travel greatly reduced, so did air freight rates skyrocket, and many have to be offloaded to sea shipping ie. containers, further causing container shortage.

the freight charge increase has caused almost all commodity price to rise in cost. the key is its temporary. once fakedemic is eased due to vaccines and reopening, the empty containers gonna come back online and the shipping rates gonna return to normal. 

in terms of oil, oil price went fucking NEGATIVE in 2020. of course in 2021 with the rebound it gonna INCREASE IN PRICE. like holy fuck, all these fucktards talking about inflation while mentioning oil prices increase. what a joke. and oil price increase (or more accurately, RETURN TO NORMAL) not only gonna increase transport cost back to normal, but also increase deriratives such as plastics. 

timber... its simply fakedemic restriction on timber mills. timber itself has no shortage. and also freight rate play a huge role. 

there is absolutely no inflation. the price increases are not sustainable. freight rates gonna tank and with it all that ""inflation"" BS gonna die with it.

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Some of the most promising patents involve wearable technology and voice recognition-based headsets.

In the past several years, Kopin has contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense to research wearable head-mounted computers for soldiers. They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin's growth potential.”

Essentially, Kopin competes in the same space as MVIS and VUZI. But they’re not exactly playing the same game.

**Tech**

First, KOPN’s tech and patents mentioned here are highly promising. I’ll talk a bit more about them, but feel free to check out this cool series of webinars [yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5E4WsPVOYY&feature=youtu.be). Another thing to do is read the linked article; Kopin recently shipped its first batch of OLED [microdisplays](https://www.oled-info.com/kopin-developeds-double-stack-oled-architecture-higher-brightness-oled). They have their own double-stack architecture which enhances battery life and image fidelity—two components that will be key for things like consumer electronics. I believe they will win in this space.

They also have a chip for voice activation called [Whisper](https://www.kopin.com/audio-solutions/), which they’ve filed over 20 patents for. They claim that “Whisper maintained an accuracy rate of 93 percent in a 95 dB noise environment, compared to competitive products, which maintained an accuracy rate of just 40 percent or less.” Given how people will want to use their smart glasses hands-free, this will be key. And based on the above quote, they will win here too.

Finally, it’s worth mentioning the company’s military connections. Many don’t realize this, but Kopin is the [largest](https://www.kopin.com/military-applications/) supplier of microdisplays for the U.S. military. Think things like thermal weapon sights, night vision goggles and pilot helmet mounted displays for F-35 fighter jets. This is quite a testimonial in my opinion; the military doesn’t play when it comes to technology…

All of this tech is protected via over 200 wearables-related patents, and 20 patents related to OLED. Their tech advantage is also reflected by their blue-chip customer base, which really speaks for itself:

I’d encourage any technical people to delve more into Kopin and their customers to really understand the power of their patents and product offering. Maybe leave a comment below!

**Financials**

For every bet, including “informed bets” like the stock market, there are two key components: the cost of the ticket and the payout potential. What I like about $KOPN is that you are paying *hugely* “less” to bet on the future of AR/VR (at least relative to competitors). Essentially, $KOPN is in a highly appealing financial position, with the potential for “hype”—which hasn’t really moved the stock as drastically—serving as a nice call option on the stock. First, check out the Kopin quarterly income statement:

https://preview.redd.it/lgodi0yaeww61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=478c34aa29ca6398ffce3570102f6e606108c81f

A few trends stick out. First, the company is steadily growing revenues, while maintaining a reasonable GPM. They are also increasing R&D spend, which is important for a company in a burgeoning and highly technological sector. But really, the most exciting trend is that of Operating Income margin, which has gone from negative to positive, along with EPS!

The company also posted $34.9 million in LTM revenue as of the last quarter. Compare this to MVIS, with $3 million over the same time frame. Now, it’s quite clear that this company presents *at least* an equally attractive financial situation as MVIS, by any standard definition.

Further, if this trajectory continues and other things hold, the company would continue to post positive EPS—which is something that competitors like VUZI or MVIS simply cannot claim. After the last earnings report, where Kopin flipped EPS positive, the stock reacted extremely well, shooting up over 20%. What will happen if they improve even further?

The company is also not likely, in my opinion, to undertake any significant dilutive actions, or to go bankrupt. This is because they have an attractive balance sheet with **no debt**. So let’s put it like this: you are getting positive EPS, with a good balance sheet, at an $875 million market cap. Compare this to MVIS at a $3.3 billion market cap, with negative EPS, or VUZI at a $1.5 billion market cap—and also with negative EPS! In my view, you “pay” much less to bet on AR/VR with KOPN.

So what do you *get* if you’re “paying less?”

**Catalysts**

First, you get access to a market growing at a rather nice CAGR. Since Kopin will be a major player in this market, you can simply check this estimation from the KOPN corporate presentation. Assuming KOPIN gets a mere 1% of this spend, they will be shockingly undervalued here.

https://preview.redd.it/dey6u3kieww61.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=add762fbaf92cf4bb5cd9cf01fffa23f2ee1f43d

But perhaps more excitingly, you get access to a near-term series of catalysts which could see the share price appreciate significantly. Here’s a potential timeline, which doesn’t include the potential for surprise events:

* **May 4th Earnings Call**
* May 12 Webinar II - Present AR / VR
* May 26 Webinar III - Future AR / VR
* June 6-7 Stifel Tech Conference
* June 7-9 Apple WorldWide Developers Conference

This presents numerous “shots on goal” for $KOPN.

Of course, ultimately the company’s fate depends on performance, because the ticker has traded largely without hype, at least when compared to MVIS or VUZI. Consider the following comparison of the three companies to get an idea how little followed and undervalued KOPN is. First, the MVIS financial “highlights”:

https://preview.redd.it/ll5yanrceww61.png?width=2210&format=png&auto=webp&s=1332365538f72d4032f63ad5cc06112d577b89aa

Now, VUZI:

https://preview.redd.it/o7qop3hdeww61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7c45622355639fe57d46c131c39c4b45539b12

A bit better than MVIS, but still…

And, finally, KOPN:

https://preview.redd.it/6c9f78ceeww61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=00bea97b3e6438e79fcfecfc4529168df40f4bc3

Now, I’m sure I’ll have a million of you reeeing out, telling me how I just don’t understand the tech, and tHat MVIS wIlL gO tO tHe mOOn. That’s fine. I’m not here to convince anyone. All I’m doing is suggesting that you, rubbing together your two brain cells, **look through the above and play spot the trend.** Then ask yourself: as this market grows, which of these companies do you believe in?

Personally, I believe in the recently newly profitable technology leader partnered with Lockheed Martin, FLIR, and Google.

**TL;DR:**

**Long $KOPN.**

I am in a middle of a contemplation period right now in deciding what could be my best decision for my portfolio. So it would be great if you guys can give me some advice for the upcoming periods.

My plan is to close out all of my positions regardless of long or short by middle of August (personal reasons) and I have been in a deep loss around 30~40% loss due to the small cap sell off for hyper-growth stocks (bngo, gevo, nio, chpt, etc.). 

So, I was planning to close out all of them by this week and move onto new ventures (swing trades, momentum trades, etc.) to recoup my losses, do you guys think that it would be a good thing to do? What course of action will you do to minimize the losses before I close out my account in August?

The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...

&#x200B;

The first ""issue"" was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a **$234,357.55 cash call** on my account.

[Cash Call](https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25)

You may be thinking, ""you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen"", but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned **<10 shares** of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300's (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a **short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86**, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out.

I'm still not sure what happened that day, but E\*TRADE admitted it was an ""error"" on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn't even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?

Well a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a *PMCC* on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn't have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for **19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM** resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for...

**...$21,554.07!** Again, after contacting E\*TRADE and looking up whatever a ""Fed Call"" was, it was deemed to be yet another ""error"" on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. **$8.** No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E\*TRADE.

Okay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to *\*drumroll please\*,* **over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!** I was the lucky winner of the E\*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I've had to contact support for their ""issues"", I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E\*TRADE employee!

As I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar 'Fed Call', they may not act rationally - that's a lot of fucking money. And they'd have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn't make mistakes like this...or maybe not.

I guess the point of this post is to remind people to **be careful**. Up until recently, this hasn't been an industry where regular people had access to these resources, and it seems like they wish it stayed that way.",

n5l6w2,,wallstreetbets,post,1620234970,"Better Markets recommendations to SEC for constructive short selling : Recommendations to protect retail and market from destructive short selling in preparation for Thursday's House Financial Services Committee hearing.Heya WSB, some info came out of Better Markets that's worth sharing in light of the upcoming House Financial Services Committee hearing this Thursday. It's a good opportunity for retail investors to get better informed and get empowered.

Better Markets is an independent non-profit whose focus is the promotion of public interest in the financial markets. They're like the watchdogs of Wall Street post-2008. They're proposing the following recommendations to the SEC:  (I'm merely copy-pasting the meat of their most recent report)

&#x200B;

# Public Transparency

>The SEC must dramatically improve short-interest reporting.  All short interests must be publicly reported in a (1) timely, (2) comprehensive, and (3) standalone manner designed to maximize the informational value that rationalizes short selling (and other short interests) in the securities markets.  
>  
>**Recommendations:**  
>  
>***1) Form  13F:***   The  SEC  must  implement  a  long  overdue Form  13F filing  requirement  for institutional investment managers that (1) includes a standalone short-interest schedule as a supplement to existing long-position reporting, (2) contemplates public reporting of all threshold short interests, including those involving securities lending/borrowing, options, and equity derivatives positions, and (3) is published on at least a monthly (as opposed to quarterly) basis, with an appropriately minimal delay calibrated solely to protect trading strategies.  
>  
>***2) Securities  Lending  Reporting:***   The  SEC must implement  section  984(b)  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which instructed the commission to “increase the transparency  of  information  available  to  brokers,  dealers, and  investors,  with  respect  to  the  loan  or borrowing of securities” and which was supposed to be completed “\[n\]ot later than 2 years after the date of \[the Dodd-Frank Act’s\] enactment” in July 2010.1This flagrant disregard of a Congressional directive must  be  remedied  with a securities-lending regulatory  and  public reporting framework (see also comments relating to the consolidated audit trail below).  
>  
>***3) FINRA  Broker-Dealer  Reporting:***   The  SEC  must  require the Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority (“FINRA”) to implement daily aggregate short interest reporting for broker-dealers, as it has implemented for the equity  trade  reporting  facilities (see footnote  2 below).    Presently, FINRA Rule  4560 requires broker-dealers  to  report  total  short  positions  in  all  customer  and  proprietary  accounts in  all  equity securities  only twice  per  month. As above,  we  encourage  the  SEC  and  FINRA  to  require  broker-dealer short interest reporting with an appropriately minimal delay.  
>  
>***4) FINRA  Equity  Trade  Reporting  Facilities  &  Exchange  Reporting:***  The  SEC must  implement  regulations requiring FINRA to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC.  The SEC must similarly implement regulations requiring the securities exchanges to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC. The SEC must also consider consolidating information in a descriptive monthly short-sale report and making some portion of the data available through its data visualization tools.

# Regulatory Safeguards:

>The  SEC  must  ensure that short  selling  is  subject  to a reasonable,  unambiguous regulatory  framework that restricts  and  deters short-selling  practices that interfere  with  fair,  orderly,  and efficient markets.  
>  
>**Recommendations:**  
>  
>***5) Eliminate Market-Maker Exception to the Locate Requirement:***  The SEC must institute a broad prohibition on naked short selling (see Appendix A below) and abandon the market-making exception to the Locate Requirement in Regulation SHO.3 That loophole permits the largest proprietary trading firms to engage in naked short selling on the theory that it facilitates trading in hard-to-borrow securities. However, the SEC’s settlement regulations with respect to mandatory buy-ins already provide special accommodations to market-makers that cannot close out their short positions within the failure-to-delivery (“FTD”) close-out timeframe.  
>  
>***6) Short Position Accountability and Limits:***  The SEC must implement a net short position accountability and position limits framework, along with a special filing requirement for market participants that have net short positions at least in hard-to-borrow equities deemed excessive (i.e., exceeding an SEC-determined threshold) relative to the total tradeable float in a security.  Stocks experiencing aggregate short interest in excess of 90 percent of the tradeable float in the security, for example, should trigger imposition of this position limits framework.  
>  
>***7) Uptick Rule:***  The SEC should reinstitute the Uptick Rule, which ameliorated price declines associated with short-selling  for  almost  70  years  without  significant  effects  on  the  development  of  the  U.S.  capital markets.  The SEC’s elimination of that rule prior to the 2008 financial crisis was unnecessary and poorly conceived.  Although there is merit to the Alternative Uptick Rule, we are not persuaded that a single-day 10 percent downturn in a company’s share  price  should  be required  to  reinstate uptick restrictions on short selling.

# Operational Integrity:

>The SEC must ensure that operational integrity is maintained throughout the clearing and settlement system.  
>  
>**Recommendations**:  
>  
>***8) Mandatory  Buy-Ins  and Punitive  Fee  Assessments:***   The  SEC  must continue  to require  clearing broker-dealers to immediately close out failures-to-deliver (“FTDs”) during the settlement process,4which should include mandatory (1) buy-in processes on T+2 for short sales (in a T+1 settlement framework); and(2) fee  assessments designed  to  punish  and  deter firms  with  FTDs that are  not  closed  out  timely under Regulation SHO. Fee assessments should climb as the outstanding period for a short-selling-related FTD lengthens.  
>  
>***9) T+1 Settlement:***  The SEC must shorten the settlement cycle to T+1 (i.e., trade-date-plus-one-trading-day), which would reduce operational and other risks in our settlement system, including risks associated with FTDs and naked short selling.The securities markets currently operate on a T+2 time horizon.  Because margin models at the National Securities Clearing Corporation account for risks during the period of time that elapses between the trading and settlement of transactions, a shorter time horizon for settlement—like  T+1—would  not  only  reduce  risks to  the  clearing and  settlement system  but  also  generally  reduce liquidity  demands  and  risks  to  clearing  firms  that  must  meet  margin  calls  calibrated  to  the  risks  and volatilities expected for the firm’s overall portfolio during the unsettled risk period.In addition to these benefits, the shortened T+1 settlement period may diminish the number of unsettled transactions arising from  the  re-lending  process,  which  has  been  characterized  as  creating  temporary  “phantom”  or “duplicate” shares.

# Monitoring  and Enforcement:

>The  SEC  must  ensure that  the Division  of  Enforcement (‘DOE”) has  the information to protect investors and markets and punish and deter unlawful short selling practices, including manipulation and fraud  
>  
>**Recommendation:**  
>  
>***10) Consolidated Audit Trail:***  Short selling information will be part of the CAT, once operationalized.  The SEC therefore must promptly implement the long-overdue and industry-delayed CAT,so that its divisions can analyze timely  and  comprehensive  information  on  short-selling  for  oversight,  enforcement,  and  policy purposes.See our CAT fact sheet.The SEC also must require regulatory and public reporting of certain information  relating  to securities-lending  activities.    Thus,  it  must  explore  requiring  securities-lending reporting as part of the CAT .

# Conclusion

>Recent data analyzed by the SEC suggests that short selling may comprise as much as half of all listed equity share volume.5Despite  this  fact,  the  practice  is  subject  to  a  rudimentary  regulatory  framework.    Our  recommendations  for reasonable  short-selling  transparency requirements,  regulatory  safeguards,  operational  improvements,  and  monitoring and enforcement measures would enhance the current SEC framework, protect fair, orderly, and efficient trading, level the informational and trading playing field for investors, and better serve issuers (companies), investors, and the purposes of the securities markets—i.e., to support capital formation and the integrity of the price discovery process that informs capital allocation.  
>  
>Unless the SEC makes significant progress in each of the four identified areas, certain short selling practices in the U.S. securities markets will continue to undermine investor and issuer confidence, as well as the fundamental purposes of our markets.

Why you should almost never short the S&P500A bunch of noobs with their crayon charts are coming back to tell you why you should short the S&P500.  I'm here to tell you that they are mostly idiots and you will almost surely not make money doing it as a long term play.

Story time:  Back in 2019, long before gmreeeee,  this sub had less than a million subscribers and we talked about things like earnings plays, the nasdaq 100, the infinite leverage kid, TrAdE TalKs GoiNg WelL, and Donald Pump.  Back then you could make free money by just buying tech calls or literally anything for that matter.  In February 2020 the S&P500 was ripping higher and higher on increasingly worse news:  mass covid outbreaks, trade talks going to shit, Jerome Powell doing NotQE and bonds flipping their shit.   Then one sunday night spooz opened sharply lower and drill team 6 went to work.  These dudes were causing circuit breaker after circuit breaker and options liquidity went to shit across the board.  Implied volatility was so high that a call ten strikes above market was basically the same price as the atm ones.  Then, when we thought it couldn't get any worse, Putin said that Russia was not going to cut production at OPEC and crude futures plummeted.  The price action was so crazy that front month crude futures settled at negative prices.  This means that you had to pay people to take your oil.  Then, all of a sudden, the market rebounded and all the smug shorts got their asses handed to them as the S&P500 went  through multiple circuit breaking weeks of face ripping rallies.  So, what happened and why should you not bet against the S&P500?

&#x200B;

1. The S&P500 has the most liquid options market in the world and the way in which options are hedged means that market makers are usually forced to buy after extended drawdowns.  Large institutions like pension funds have a tremendous amount of equities on their books and these assets need to be hedged in times of stress.  When a big risk event comes along these big dogs will buy puts to protect their holdings.  They will also sell calls using their equities as collateral to bring in some premium throughout the year regardless of risk.  The market makers are on the other side of this trade, so that are usually assumed to be long calls and short puts.  Let's just look at short puts for now.  If you are a market maker then you want to eliminate your directional risk.  Since short puts will lose you money if the underlying goes down you can short shares to hedge your short put.  Remember now that puts have two huge components that determine price:  volatility and how close the market is to the strike.  When a bunch of short puts are in the money then it will have a high delta.  This means that the MM's will need to short a ton of shares to hedge the large delta.  The big kicker here is that, for one, volatility is mean reverting, and two, that the option will eventually expire.  When volatility mean reverts, as it must since risk is not constant in our world, the deltas on the short call will reduce.  Less delta means that MMs are short too many shares and they need to buy (this is the effect of vanna).  Hence vix drop = share buys (in general, not always).  The second factor is that eventually the options will expire and hence the market maker will no longer need to short into dips to hedge their gamma, meaning there is less selling pressure.  They might even need to buy to get flat from all the short stock they have after their options expire.  It is no coincidence that the huge rally we saw in 2020 off the covid lows happened the day after a massive amount of in the money options expired during March quad witching.  If you want to read more about this stuff here is a good resource.

&#x200B;

2.    Bond  yields are incredibly low and this creates a risk on appetite.  If you are rich where do you put your money right now?  If you put it in bonds then you are not even going to beat inflation and, moreover, if yields spike, your bond will be worth significantly less.  These factors make bonds with long duration a risk both immediately and also in opportunity cost.  We can put our money into an asset that will do nothing or we can put it into a large index like the S&P500 where, over 10 years, we know that we can probably get at least 20% out of it.  The best part is that big money can easily hedge its directional risk by buying puts and, if needed, sell calls against holdings to pay for the put.  This means big $$$ can get protection for free.  All this infers that there is a natural flow of money  into the market.  Evaluations might be crazy high right now but they start to make more sense when you adjust it for bond yields.  Dr Edward Yardeni has a blog that talks about this more in depth.

Now, of course, this stuff could be wrong and a well articulated counter point can be found on Dr. Lacy Hunt's open letters.

3.  The S&P500 is comprised of the best 500 companies America has to offer.  They are the ones that will THRIVE when conditions are tough because their competition will most likely not make it.

4.  What's the market going to fall on?  Trillions in stimulus?

\------------------------------------------------------------

Know that all the things I mentioned above are very real structural reasons for why shorting the S&P is a very dangerous play.  If you want to scalp the short side then I don't think there are any issues, but holding a short position for any time longer than a week means that you are working against all the factors I mentioned above.  When will the S&P500 be overvalued?  Well, if we adjust for bond yields probably at 7000-8000 on the spx.   So sit back and enjoy the free money.  Don't over leverage on the long side because big down moves do happen, but why not just buy a few call debit spreads that expire in a month and profit off of an unstoppable juggernaut?  Buy one call in the money and sell one call out the money.  Until the 10 year has yields over 5%, or until China invades Taiwan I think we don't have much to worry about.","['SPGI', 'NDAQ']"

I dont know if the previous post made it to WSB. Been lurking here for awhile posting comments here and there. Here is the link to my previous post.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfom5q/long_oil/

TLDR: Still have my calls however I sold some at the top in March and bought more since then. Fully levered to specifically OXY and XOM. 

XOM Calls:
171 $80 calls for 1/21/22
63 $75 calls for 1/21/22
87 $70 calls for 1/21/22
22 $60 calls for 1/21/22

OXY Calls:
21 $40 calls for 1/20/23

Now for some details. As of yesterday we got our first clear indication that the reflation trade is on like donkey kong. The API estimate for supplies for oil were a huge draw in inventory. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1389680376545697798 

This has been slowly building with other investment banks earlier this year saying that oil production is in a major deficit and will significantly effect the price per BBL later in this year. As of right now we have Goldman Sachs at $80 by this fall (https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Oil-To-Hit-80-On-Largest-Ever-Demand-Jump.html) JPM at $75 by this fall, Morgan Stanley at $60 for the year but $75 this fall, and other major investment banks that have gone balls deep in betting on the oil price environment. So clearly, they see something coming this year that hasnt accurately been priced in to the energy sector through the share price. (Ignoring the small cap energy names and talking about the large caps and Majors IE XOM, CVX, PXD, OXY, FANG, EOG, MRO and maybe you would look at ConocoPhillips..)

This brings me to my next point, all those companies have told investors that the plan to keep production flat to return money to shareholders. That means that if demand returns to pre-Covid levels in the near term we will have a significant supply deficit on our hands. Now lets look at the EIA data (next data dump from them is later today around 10:30 CST.)

Here is the general link for the EIA Gasoline Supply ( https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/ ) Key takeaways from this is that Gasoline demand is up and continuing to increase, additionally, the EIA reported on their outlook for the summer driving season and they estimated that the price of gasoline would increase alongside with the increase in driving that we might see due to pandemic being handled. Specifically, the Biden Administration has set July 4th as the date for true reopening assuming we can get enough people vaccinated. I see this as a key date to watch. People seem restless after being locked up all year and want to take a vacation especially since the prices of vacations are cheaper and most families having the most liquidity that they have ever had on record. https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/archive/2021/210407/includes/analysis_print.php

Now that seems to be a pretty rosy outlook for gasoline demand and trucking diesel has already surpassed last year precovid levels back in March. So that means travel and transportationa are up. Now lets look at air travel which would add more demand to the supply chain. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47756

As you can see in the link EIA shows that we are moving in an upward direction in air travel but I would expect this to slowly keep rebounding this year while coming back to the original usage next year. 

Now lets look at production, something that is heavily debated amongst oil bulls/bears. EIA has revised their production estimates 3 times this year downward because of lack of capital going to replace the production. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47056

That 8% drop from 2020 to the previous estimate was a shock to some but now the EIA predicts that the US will produce 10.9 MMBPD which some think is a stretch due to the amount of drilling required to bring production to a level that we were at in 2020 and 2019. https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_oil_rotary_rigs

The US has been slowly adding rigs to keep drilling new HZ wells that will help keep the production flat however, due to the extreme decline curve of HZ wells (they decline about 67% in the first year) both the amount of wells being drilled and completed will need to dramatically increase to meet the demand. Roughly speaking it will take an operator about 20 days to drill a well to total depth and completion according to SM at the beginning of the year however they are one of the fastest drilling and completion teams in the Permain Basin. https://s22.q4cdn.com/545644856/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-SM-Energy-Presentation.pdf SLIDE 14

Also something to consider is the fact that most operators now drill and complete wells in large groups nicknamed the ""Cube"" (for SM its about 8 but some go so far as 36 at once.) So wells drilled in this style would take between 160-720 days. (Now for a less aggressive estimate we can assume that some companies complete multiple wells together and this is known as Simulfrac which would cut the completion time in half for large groups. For sake of optimism lets just say 80-360 days. This means wells that are drilled now wont be online to keep production flat until about fall at the earliest and next year at the latest.

All this info is to setup the big kicker. With our boi J-POW printing like no ones business and Oil being priced in dollars across the world we can also get some weird inflationary pressure due to the dollar getting weaker. Alongside with the interest rates coming higher and investors flocking to safer boomer dividend stocks. That is why I took agressive bets on XOM. This is the biggest boomer of all. They are incredible about producing around the world, refining, and getting great prices for their products. 

OXY's bet is for a separate post but it boils down to this being a company that might be too indebted to survive unless they get $65 oil which as of yesterday we are there. They have torque to the oil and gas market and should be able to pay down debt thus making them financially solvent and increasing the share price. 

Hold on to your bootstraps boys. This year is going to be wild for Oil and Gas companies. There are a couple of risks to this theory but with the API information and IRAN posting a video about blowing up congress it looks like Repubs are going to want to get tough on Iran and not sign a new deal. That leaves roughly 2MMBOPD off the market. Venezuela just decreased production to 500mBOPD which is terrible considering the size of their reserves. My case actually still works for this year even if both Iran and OPEC+ start pumping due to the demand rebound that will cause a terrific spike in prices. 

This is my own opinion and I am probably retarded so dont take anything as fact but I think its setting pretty nicely.. GLHF.

Edit: forgot to mention I’ll update this when the EIA numbers come out.

n5k7s7,,wallstreetbets,post,1620232558,"The Case for Canadian CannabisI've been heavily bullish on ACB for awhile now, some weeks to my detriment and some weeks to my benefit, and I've been constantly hearing about how once America legalizes, American cannabis companies are just gonna magically become the backbone of the cannabis market. So I wanted to make the case for why that's just effectively untrue because of infrastructure and branding.

Starting with infrastructure, a key importance in maintaining national and international markets is supply chain management. You have to be able to move product. American companies can't currently move product across state lines en mass. While my knowledge of the legality of interstate transport is scarce currently, but definitely gonna sign up for a cannabis law course soon, The basics are that movement of recreational marijuana across state lines is interstate trafficking. Therefore, most marijuana companies in America only cultivate local markets. Canadian companies like ACB, TLRY, VFF, etc. have already cultivated national market infrastructure as well as infrastructure to affect international trade. US companies are gonna open at a half-decade disadvantage in this sub-market.

As for recognizable brands, Americans know about Tilray, Aurora, and Village Farms already. Some of us know High Tide and other small American brands, but there aren't any widely known American brands. What I buy at a dispensary in Massachusetts is very different from what someone in Colorado or California buys. In fact, one of the most widely available brands I've seen is Bettie's Eddies, and those are only in 4 states. Canadian companies are starting with marketable brands. I've been wrong before plenty of times, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that these companies would dominate an American marketplace with federal legalization around the corner. Tilray will easily be the mass market distributor of medical cannabis. Aurora will likely be the most recognizable premium cannabis distributor, especially in more hipster oriented markets like Portland, Seattle, LA, New York, etc., and Village Farms will likely be the largest provider of non-premium recreational products. 

While I understand the thought process that American legalization will be a major boon for American companies, the capabilities of these companies seems more and more lacking. With ACB's license to sell in Mexico, it will likely become the largest distributor in North America. With Tilray's positioning as the largest producer of marijuana in the world, it's likely to keep that title and expand further with American legalization. I'm bullish on all of the major Canadian cannabis stocks and loading up to fight the shorts.",

PSEC has been solid for me, and covers my Robinhood 2.5% annual margin fee, plus extra shares. This 2.5% rate is the only reason I'm still in Robinhood. I might be an idiot, but I'm up 318% for the year.

n5kmhr,,wallstreetbets,post,1620233585,"10 recommendations for improving SEC's regulatory frameworkThere's been some controversy over the removal of a post submitted by Better Markets. The mods gave the reason that it was because of self-promotion. Which, I can't argue with - it definitely looked like self-promotion. So now, I've taken out the important details and summarized them as best as I can. I've put them in bullet points for everyone to discuss.

> First, short selling can be one component of a well-functioning, liquid securities market and can contribute useful information to the price discovery process, under the right regulatory conditions.

To start off, they agree short selling is important to price discovery of highly overvalued (and possibly fraudulent) stocks. Now, like most good things, they can be abused.

> Second, short selling can interfere with fair, orderly, and efficient markets and substantially distort the price discovery process, under the wrong regulatory conditions. It there by can adversely impact the operation and price of capital for companies, especially early stage companies vulnerable to unlawful or abusive short-selling practices.

Big point here is that new companies are especially vulnerable to short selling. Agreed. The main takeaway from their suggestions is that short-selling still has a place, but because of its allure to abusive actors, transparency and proper regulation should be implemented. I think everyone can get behind that. Now, here are their suggestions:

1. Update 13F form requirements to make sure they include standalone short-interest schedule, public reporting of threshold short interests and those involved in securities derivatives, and have it posted monthly instead of quarterly.

2. Implement a securities-lending regulatory and public reporting framework (that was apparently supposed to done through section 984(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010).

3. SEC must require FINRA to setup a system to get brokers to post daily short interest.

4. SEC must require FINRA to publish short-interest volume data daily and monthly short-interest transaction data.

5. Prohibit naked short selling - specifically, remove the market maker's exception to the locate requirement in Regulation SHO.

6. SEC make a short position accountability framework, and include special filing requirements for hard-to-borrow securities. They used "">90% short interest of float"" as an example that would trigger this.

7. Re-instate the uptick rule where short-sales must be done at a price higher than the previous trade.

8. SEC needs to tighten up on failure-to-deliver close-out requirements and enforce them properly. They recommended fees to punish this climb the longer failure-to-delivers remain open.

9. Settlement cycle should be reduced to T+1. They argued this would diminish the amount of phantom shares created.

10. The consolidated audit trail (CAT) need be reformed and properly implemented. They say short selling information should be included in this. In essence, there should be more ease of access and transparency in who borrows what and when.

I think some of these are valid and warrant consideration and discussion.

I believe there is a HUGE inflation trade here... I haven't, dug into the fundamentals, but the equities are trading at astronomically low P/E ratio with the current Lumber future prices. Something like a P/E of 3-4-5??

The equities are SO mis-priced compared to the historical pricings. Particularly when opposed to the 2018 peak.

Just using CANFOR here, but same goes for any Lumber sawmill companies.

I believe if we could surpass the equities price of 2018, we could see an easy 50% upside.

While I do believe it goes way up tomorrow, ($35-$40ish), I think Thursday is really the day to watch. Rocket is launching Rocket Auto soon and for some reason it’s rarely mentioned in these Rocket posts except for the ones with thorough DD. Please realize this isn’t just funding car loans, they will actually be SELLING CARS online as well. It’s similar to Carvana. The potential for their revenue to increase 50-100% in the next year exists with that. And, there is no reason to doubt they will take over market share there just as they have with mortgages.

 Now, back to why you should hold after close tomorrow... I fully expect them to announce the launch date for the Rocket Auto division along with some details and guidance around it tomorrow afternoon. Obviously the stock is already severely undervalued, but factor in the coming soon Rocket Auto and we should really be $60-$70. RKT is at the bottom now and has traded around $22 for 2 months straight. Is there really downside risk to holding? I don’t think so. TBH if you hang on to it a few more months you could probably triple your money. The days are boring flatlining are coming to and end quickly.

The market sold off violently in reaction, with growth stock-heavy index Nasdaq falling more than 3% at one stage. 

Within hours, both the White House and Yellen walked back on her comments. She said herself that it was neither a recommendation to the Federal Reserve nor a prediction. Just how sensitive are the policymakers to the market reactions?

Did she not know that her comments would have a negative impact on the stock market? It would be interesting to hear what Yellen and Powell have to say in the days ahead. Powell has been consistent in saying that this is not time to talk about talking about interest rates hikes and Yellen has somehow managed to scare the market with a comment alluding to talking about hikes.

I have negative net worth due to student loans. I couldn’t tie my own shoes until I was 8 years old. If you are taking financial advice from me, you’re in deep shit. That said…

Hi everybody! Cleveland-Cliffs (Ticker: CLF) is an American steel company and in this post I will explain why I made it my biggest position since the MVIS short squeeze.  In short, $CLF is a vertically integrated steel company:  It mines ore (the largest ore producer in the country!) and turns that ore into steel and sells that steel. Steel is used to make a gazillion different products, from cars to forks to buildings. 

Now that a supply chain crunch has hit, steel prices are skyrocketing literally everyday. It closed at $20.36 yesterday. The stock has significant short interest - Ortex reported 11.26% a few days ago. These shorts are probably screwed soon, because CLF is a great long-term hold & the market is waking up to it. 

CAVEAT: I was hoping to have a few more days to write this post, but $CLF started ripping upwards yesterday. The media began reporting more heavily on steel prices and commodities super cycles over the last week, perhaps because steel prices have gotten too obscene or because Warren Buffett mentioning steel this weekend. So I am rushing my writing of this a bit, because I want to get this out while I believe the getting is still real good.  I will try to hit the main points, both bull and bear. 

### OK OK gimme the juice: Why did $CLF break upwards yesterday?

# 🚀🚀🚀 Macroeconomic conditions have aligned for CLF to become the top steel company in the USA for decades to come.

Burry actually got visited by the SEC after warning about hyperinflation and deleted his Twitter account. 👀

Many factors are driving this inflation. One of those factors (it’s a feedback loop, really…) is that steel prices are surging: **[US Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel Futures Contracts](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-contracts) 🍌 CLF is (as of 2020!) the largest producer of hot-rolled steel in America and stands ready to benefit from this inflation. 

### **2. American supply chains are fucked. 🕳**

As a result of tax incentives, lax enforcement, and “free trade” agreements, American industrial/manufacturing capacity has been devastated over the last 40 years (politicians love to talk about how “jobs have been shipped overseas”, but not fix it).  Well, the chickens came home to roost during Covid-19, which I would argue accelerated many timelines, including a supply chain crunch. America is being forced to come to grips with the importance of being able to produce essential goods internally. Steel is a pillar of the economy. President Trump supported the industry with tariffs, and President Biden has continued them.

### **3.  China has stopped dumping steel on the market. China is now competing for scrap metal. Both of these things make the price of steel rise. 🇨🇳📈**

For years, the Chinese government supported steel production as a jobs program for its citizens.  This resulted in China having way too much steel, so they dump it into the international market at a discount. This drives the price of steel lower. 

China’s methods of steel production have  been an unmitigated environmental disaster. But it’s 2021, baby! China is now committed to cleaning things up & is revamping how it makes steel. This has multiple implications that affect the international steel market. 

First, China is making less steel 👉 They’re no longer dumping it into the international market, which _was_ driving prices down.  So now steel prices are going boom boom.  💸

Second, China is using a different steel-making process, one that is more reliant on scrap metal.  That means China is now buying up scrap metal. China is great at getting its hands on raw materials — it’s government generally acts more quickly to developing macroeconomic conditions than the American government.   They have been buying up commodities for years. [Bloomberg: China’s Commodities Binge Makes America’s Future More Expensive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/u-s-infrastructure-plan-faces-problem-china-s-commodities-copper-binge)

There is a very good video of the CLF CEO talking about all this called “China, The Environment, and the Next Decade” that you can find, but I can’t post here due to automod. :)

### **4. A Squeeze is beginning in the American scrap metal market. ⛓**

[Nearly 70% of the Steel used in the US is recycled from scrap. Steel used in construction has a 90% recycling Rate.](https://www.bir.org/publications/facts-figures/download/643/175/36?method=view).  

As explained, scrap prices are soaring. This is going to eat into those scrap-dependent steel companies’ bottom lines (Nucor, US Steel) . 

### **5. CLF is not reliant on scrap. CLF will have higher profit margins. 🚀**

CLF mines its own ore. It does not need to buy scrap to make steel. In fact, it can sell steel iron ore to other companies if it chooses.  

This means CLF is going to have increasingly large product margins from the insane steel prices.  

### 6. **CLF is gonna be able to deliver product - essential to American infrastructure. America needs steel during the current commodities supercycle & it will turn to Cleveland-Cliffs. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸**

CLF is American as fuck. Its roots go all the way back to 1847, and it was founded by a member of the famous Mather family (remember the Cotton Mather guy who presided over the Salem Witch Trials?). It is traditionally a mining company, but in 2020, they acquire AK Steel and also ArcelorMittal’s US holdings (in a down market!). Now they’re vertically integrated, mining iron and spewing out high-quality steel.

This mining history and very recent acquisitions are two reasons why so many analysts have overlooked CLF until the last few weeks. The acquisitions are not priced in, except insofar as everyone has ragged on CLF for taking on a lot of debt to do this. Fair, I guess, but have you seen those steel prices? CLF is going to be able to pay its debt down in record time, then start sloughing off cash.  The steel price surge is not yet priced into many steel stocks, and I think CLF has the most room to run out of all of them. 

CLF is also highly likely to benefit from any big infrastructure bill. They have a unionized workforce, and are likely to benefit from government largesse in big construction projects. 

# 🐻🐻🐻 The main risk points
* How did CLF find itself in such an amazing position at the early phase of a commodities supercycle? It’s CEO, the Brazilian Lourenco Goncalves, is a luminary in the steel industry. He engineered CLF’s takeover of Arcelor-Mittal’s US assets and AK Steel in 2020, which put them in this perfect position . He’s also famous for telling a Goldman Saches analyst (with a “hold” rating…) that he was going to embarrass them so badly, they would have to kill themselves.  If Lourenco continues to guide CLF to a preeminent position in steel, a commanding height of the economy, then books will be written about his reign, a la Lee Iacocca. The man is a mastermind — it would be a blow to lose him.   
* A horrendous balance sheet from their 2020 acquisitions. CLF financed last year’s takeovers with expensive debt. However, _this is exactly what the famous CEO said he is fixing first_.  With the enormous steel price increase locked in for the next year, he should be able to pay it down rapidly. This is one of the main reasons this company is still so cheap, imo. The market is cottoning on rapidly, though.
* Biden repeals steel tariffs.
* Commodity prices historically moved in cycles, with occasional “super cycles”, which are more extended periods of high demand. Analysts are increasingly reporting that we’re moving into a supercycle. The risk here is that something kills the supercycle. For example, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 killed the last supercycle. 
* High short interest. With all of this positive news, you may be shocked - shocked!! - that there are a lot of folks on Wall Street who have decided to short this all-American company.  [Ortex reported short interest at 11.26% the other day](https://u.teknik.io/vR4rH.png) What idiot shorts a vertically integrated steel company when steel prices are surging out of control, I don’t know, but this is apparently the situation. There are deep-pocketed people with an interest in keeping this big steel dog down.

n4r47g,,wallstreetbets,post,1620142071,"AMD: An explanation on merger arbitrage and how to play it for big gainsI read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist.

**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?

**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). 

After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/upndown#!\/vizhome\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\_16114624177710\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/wvsnql2p64x61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b19380ad8d798a8e2c8c6d8736d97714c553cd)

In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/gi31myc384x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b1036b008d8c9fea2f74996f7e3c5cf70410e2)

What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. 

So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/xijh87hfb4x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc144da8bbba46b37ddb59f18d306bbad6104599)

I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). 

For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.

The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.

Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I don't really know what I'm doing. But I like the stock.

n5kjrp,,wallstreetbets,post,1620233393,"Western Digital and the great storage shortage. Long $WDCRecently a crypt0-currency called Chia came out as off April 30th, and the unique thing about this coin it, with a bunch of other things, mines on storage. Like hard drives and SSDs. Long story short it was a success, so far, and even before the coin went public articles like this [one](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chia-500-percent-increase-adata-high-capacity-ssd-sales) were talking about shortages of storage devices due to miners buying them in advance. 

You can see the chart below shows the total storage on the network, and it has become parabolic.

[Storage on network](https://preview.redd.it/63yobwxnybx61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c68e8d1f4a60a71369c5c12d28c96e378b2deb9)

As long as the price maintains its current state of 600+ a Chia, then this should only grow. This is based on some mining calculators that basically say it is still a very profitable endeavor.

WDC is one of the most pure play storage options. They have a significant presence in Asia too, which is important. They make bulk size hard drives, which is what lots of miners want. If Chia coin maintains its explosion and the price stays high, then it WDC will do well. On top of the explosion in PC gaming, which also requires storage, it can lead to a shortage, but typically, companies like Western Digital will do well in those situations.

The game plan?

2Q earnings are going to be awesome, so I will load up on some calls before then, but that isn't till awhile. I think the best thing would be to potentially buy stock, and most importantly, keep  an eye on the stock. Fundamentally they are also great given the good financial position they are in and are set to have a killer year. The current earnings rolled over into the next few months show them in better position then in 2018, where they reached a high of $106.

Position: 10 shares of WDC. Potentially adding options if they ever seem attractive and probably before earnings, unless the thesis changes.

n4m8mw,,wallstreetbets,post,1620128514,"Nokia is extremely undervalued at current pricesOn April 29, Nokia reported stellar first quarter earnings for 2021: 

Revenue totaled €5.1 billion, 7% above the consensus estimates.

Gross margin was 38.2%, improving from 36.4% in this quarter last year.

EBITDA was €702 million, crushing the estimates of €150 million by over 367%.

It generated €1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, turning positive from the negative €6 million during Q1 2020.

Nokia’s focus on 5G is already paying off. Management is seeing “continued momentum in 5G rollouts across all geographies, especially North America.” And from the favorable margins in Nokia’s 5G products, gross margin in mobile networks improved 2.1% from last year, reaching 33.2% during the quarter.

And Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark – which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations – made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers – a great selling point.

Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark.

And this month technology consulting firm PA Consulting named Nokia “the industry leader in 5G standard essential patents.” Nokia has a leading patent portfolio with over 3,500 patents that are declared as essential to 5G. Nokia’s patent portfolio will help it maintain a technological advantage compared to its competitors.

Nokia remains extremely undervalued at current prices and it remains a strong buy. It was the first breakthrough quarter for Nokia and it is going to be a big winner for us.",

n5m9bl,,wallstreetbets,post,1620237652,"CRSR short squeeze is starting right now 🚀🚀🚀What's up retards? I'm going to try to make this brief, but concise because why use many word when few word good enough. I might be retarded, but I'm pretty sure today is going to mark the first day of a short squeeze with Corsair and unlike a lot of the other shitty ""short squeeze incoming... hopefully"" (looking at you CLOV) posts on WSB this one is going to happen (is happening) whether you Apes are in or not. I'm only here because I made a fuckton of money on GME earlier this year and I want to give something back to the community.

Here's the rub:

Corsair is a premier PC accessories company that's been around for a couple decades, but just went public towards the end of last year. Since then they have (KILLED their earnings)\[[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR)\] EVERY. SINGLE. QUARTER. coming in an average of 60% above the analyst expectations and yet somehow there's 20% short interest on the stock. At first they weren't issuing guidance because pandemic, but yesterday before the bell they reported earnings that were 75.80% above expectations AND RAISED GUIDANCE for 2021 from \~$1.875bil to \~$2bil and yet somehow the stock dropped from $35 premarket to $31.50 at the low of the day because the market is too busy trying to squeeze imaginary currencies recommended by the meme's of eccentric billionaires right now I guess. This is especially moronic because the fundamentals are so incredibly good for this company. As it currently stands market cap is roughly $3 billion, with expected revenue of $2 billion for the year and EBITDA earnings around $250 million. In other words, CRSR has a forward P/E of about 12 right now and Price to Sales of 1.5x, low enough to make a value company blush, and yet this is a rocket fueled growth company in a rapidly expanding growth sector with 20% short interest.

Digging a little deeper:

Not only did the price swing 10% from high to low yesterday, but it was a high volume day for CRSR in general and for some reason the shares short made up (73% of the volume for the day)\[[https://shortvolume.com/?t=crsr](https://shortvolume.com/?t=crsr)\]. That's right, the shorts really thought shorting another 1 million shares was the right thing to do after that rock star earnings report. This is truly, catastrophically retarded. Today the stock has been up as high as $36.11 and has been holding steady above $35. If we check how many short shares are available on iborrowdesk it looks like the shorts (haven't even started covering today)\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR)\] from their short positions that were created yesterday AND there are only about 350k short shares available to borrow right now meaning the shorts have very little ammo to try to push the stock down or hunt for stop losses. Those million short shares from yesterday are all currently under water and when they start to cover this is going to push up even higher which will trigger the rest of the 20% of the short interest to consider covering their positions and get out now. There's a word for this kind of chain reaction, what is it..? Oh yeah, SHORT. SQUEEZE.

When do we get to Mars?

Like I said, I'm not here to bullshit you, I truly want to see my fellow apes get some tendies. That said, we're probably not going all the way to Mars. This isn't another GME. But, the moon is within our ape-like grasp. This could easily touch $50 by the end of this year and hit $70+ next year. This isn't just a short squeeze play, this is a long term value play (Logitech, Corsairs major competitor, trades at a 20.5 P/E, so if all we did was reach their P/E with no more earnings growth (ha) we would be at about $55 per share). If you buy now YOU WILL MAKE MONEY. Buy and hold or get some options that will expire in a couple months (squeezes can take a while to play out) and wait, then dump them when you get a 100%+ bagger and post your gain porn. LET'S FUCKING GO!!!

TL;DR: Buy Corsair, get tendies

&#x200B;

Wanted to share some quick DD and some of my reasons why it's a good time to jump on the AMD train as a mid-long term investment. Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.

&#x200B;

**Why buy?**

$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. 

They say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. 

As a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.

&#x200B;

**Chip shortage.**

The elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. 

But I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.

&#x200B;

**Final thought**

End of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.

As always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

* Revenue and Earnings Beat
* Net sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the FactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion. The sales beat was driven by growth in Nokia’s mobile networks unit — due to strong sales of 5G equipment — and its network infrastructure segment.
* Citi analysts expected the “very strong” revenue and operating profit beat to drive significant upgrades to 2021 consensus forecasts. They noted that while the guidance remains unchanged, management said the first quarter provides a solid base for hitting the higher end of its 7% to 10% operating margin range. They maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of €3.55.
* NOK's 5G segment gains traction Nokia has been working globally to deploy its 5G solutions. The company was recently determined to have the most number of essential 5G patents of any operator by independent analysts at PA Consulting.
* 5G mobile networks services expected to increase 5-8 percent by end of 2023.
* Restructuring plan that prioritized mobile networks – including 5G – along with wired infrastructure (fiber), cloud and network services, and Nokia technologies.
* NOK is deploying a 5G network in the UAE in conjunction with Etisalat, a major telecom operator in the emerging markets sector. Partnering with Telefonica Spain to help deploy 5G service to Spain's residents by upgrading the telecom's IP network.
* NOK will work with NewCore Wireless to use the Tribal Educational Broadband Service (EBS) to deploy wireless broadband connectivity – including 5G – to rural and underserved Native American communities.

* Revenue $1.22 Billion (+481.8% YoY), beat my expectations by 3% (4 million) (market expect 1.02, beat by 18%)
* Vehicle Revenue 1.13 Billion (+489.8% YoY), beat my expectation by 3% (3 million)

* Per Vehicle Revenue between 56.34, beat my expectation by 3%
* **Adj Diluted EPS: $(0.48)**
* **Excluding SBC** and accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value**, Adj Diluted EPS $(0.04)**

**Q2 Management Outlook and My Immediate Predictions**

* **Vehicle Deliveries: 21000-22000 (management)**
* \+103-113% YoY, +5-10% QoQ
* **Total Revenues: 1.243-1.298 Billion (management)**
* \+119-128.7% YoY, +2.1-6.5% QoQ
* **Gross Margin, Vehicle Margin: 20%, 20%**
* My Q2 SBC-Adj Diluted EPS: **$(0.02) ± 0.01**
* \+167.4-277.26% YoY, +34.13-143.99% QoQ 

**Key Takeaways from Earnings Call**

Following a strong earnings report, management highlighted multiple short-term headwinds impacting NIO’s growth. The current chip shortage will retard vehicle production and deliveries in Q2. With weekly checks on the spot price of the auto chips, do not expect continued vehicle margin improvements in Q2. In fact, I choreograph for a small decline in vehicle margin in Q2, contingent on the chip situation.

The positive tailwinds for NIO are concentrated in the second half of 2021, as the chip situation ameliorates. Multiple long-term partnerships, including Metro AG and Sinopec infrastructure agreements and the NeoPark project, will improve margins for both vehicle and subscription services. NIO will likely continue to outperform luxury brands, including Audi, BMW, and Mercedes in the Chinese market, enjoying the combination of branding, cost, and continued EV subsidies. Taken together, NIO will continue its triple-digit improvements in revenue and high double-digit earnings growth. 

Through this, we realize that the determining factor in NIO's success is no longer a question of vehicle sales or production. Following in TSLA's footsteps, with the blessing of the government in swap-tech, and with a clear market niche in the mind of management simplifies our job considerably. In fact, during the earnings call, William *explicitly* remarks that (paraphrasing) ""The NIO brand will not be for the mass market.""

This significantly improves our valuation metrics and margin assumptions going forward. Away from the mass-market razor-thin margin, I began with Ferrari (NYSE: RACE) as a template for long-term COGS and Margin assumptions. **NIO isn't Ferrari, it will never be, I did not just copy-paste margin assumptions.** Ferrari's COGS is stable around 47-52% of revenue, SG&A at 10.5-9 long term, and R&D at \~20%. My assumptions for NIO go a bit lower, proxying for competitor brands like Benz, BMW, and Audi; therefore, COGS trends towards 65-60%, SG&A toward 10-9.5%, and R&D around the same. The argument for COGS not being higher is management guidance for high-take rates involving subscription services. Management has emphasized NIO not just being a car company, but also a service/lifestyle company (""We intend to directly our gains from the margin towards better products, better tech, and better service""). 

This is the core issue currently at the heart of NIO, and I encourage you all to discuss and find out the future: ***It's not selling vehicles, it's building swap stations.***

**Valuation, short, mid, and long-term**

In the short term, noting NIO's presence in a highly competitive market, with a past history of uncertainty, we assign a Terminal EPS of 20 and a discount rate of 10%, giving us a valuation of $50.85 fair price and appreciation potential of 33.96%.

&#x200B;

[short-term valuation \(3-6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/19w94w3ex5x61.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0df610c6d49b517dc47e63c09ee82b192d75e0)

***Midterm***

In the midterm, we expect NIO's EU expansion, Swap station deals, and chip issues all to be resolved, Quoting Graham/Dodd, ""we disregard negative earnings as a quantitative measure of financial health, and only use it as a qualitative measure of company performance."" NIO has made significant improvements in EPS, and will likely continue to do so.  Altering the probability weighing of our Bull, Bear, and Base cases to favor strong performance in Luxury EV markets also justifies a higher Terminal EPS valuation and a lower risk. At 28x terminal EPS, 55:30:15 Bull:Base:Bear distribution, and 9.5% discount rate, we have a mid-term appreciation potential of 95.78%

***Long term***

Long term, I strongly believe in the viability of BaaS, ADaaS, and the superiority of battery swapping in high-density urban sprawl markets; Tesla has its place in countries with similar suburban housing as the US, but markets in Pan-Asia and EU, with poor access to personal charging options, are better suited for battery swapping. In the future, NIO may support both Supercharging and Swap capabilities, lowering downtime overall; in either case, NIO's unique presentation and positioning (NIO houses lol) will ensure strong brand stickiness and continuously improving margins (from services) as take-rate improves. Therefore, with a terminal EPS multiplier of 35 and discount rate of 9%, we have an appreciation potential of 151.54% and a 3-5 year target price of $160.

n4xon5,gwzcj1o,wallstreetbets,comment,1620182359,Ya'll are missing a major point. It's a all out cock match between the US and China over world dominance of EV's and technology. You think this Sinopec deal happened out of the blue? My guess is the CEO received a late night phone call from the communist party to make this happen. They have the full backing of the Chinese government so let that soak in for a minute.,

n4xon5,gwy7944,wallstreetbets,comment,1620163003,"Can you please explain to me why I should be bullish about swap stations?

How many different battery types do they need to carry?  Is there a common form factor?  Will any of their competitors be using the same battery and the same mechanisms to attach to a car?

I think long term it sounds cool, but short term swapping doesn't make as much sense as we are still evolving battery technology.  Thoughts?",
