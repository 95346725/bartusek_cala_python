n3tdg7,,stocks,post,1620040034,"Palantir hires former IBM Watson Health exec as first US government chief medical officerhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/palantir-hires-former-ibm-watson-health-exec.html

Palantir has hired its first U.S. government chief medical officer, a former executive from IBM's Watson Health business, as the data analytics company doubles down on its life sciences business.

While the company made its name in software used by government defense agencies, sales to health-related agencies in the federal government have doubled over the last year.

The company announced Monday its has hired former IBM Watson Health Deputy Chief Health Officer Bill Kassler to lead public health and life sciences teams across Palantir's domestic and global businesses.

Kassler said in an exclusive interview with CNBC that he would bring his expertise in clinical care and public health to the role, helping to connect the software to researchers who could benefit from it.

""Palantir is just an exciting group of young, talented engineers and data scientists and real, real intelligent, smart people,"" he said. ""But in order to deploy technology, you have to understand the theory and the logic and the practice of healthcare and public health. And I think we see a lot of technology companies that want to get into health but don't know that, make mistakes because they're not intimately familiar. And what I can bring to Palantir is my expertise as a clinician, as a public health doc, as somebody who has been working in this field for years to help with the science and the strategy and the relationships.""

Investing in tech for the next pandemic

In his new role, Kassler said, he wants to help put Palantir's technology in the hands of researchers who can use it to make smart decisions in the next pandemic.

He highlighted three areas that he believes can be improved with the help of tech solutions like Palantir's: patching supply chain issues, dealing with localized surges of cases, and tackling racial and ethnic disparities.

Palantir's Foundry platform has played a significant role in the U.S. government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as private companies' handling of essential supply chains. Palantir's technology allows researchers to combine and overlay datasets in ways that can make supply chain weaknesses or outbreak hotspots more obvious, allowing them to act quickly on their findings.

On the government side, the National Institutes of Health has recently begun using Palantir's platform to combine datasets from 50 different academic groups that it funds in ways that would have been cumbersome without the software.

Palantir's technology helps the groups share data in ways that protects patient identities but allows them to gain more insights by analyzing a much larger dataset than they would have access to in their individual group settings. Julie Bush, who leads Palantir's federal health care work, said the data is now being used to better understand how the Covid-19 has impacted people with different backgrounds and conditions.

Bush said that type of broad data-sharing was less common prior to the pandemic, but that she hopes it continues after.

""People love to hoard their data,"" she said. ""And the pandemic really forced people to come together and be willing to share information and sort of set the bureaucracy aside. And, of course subject to data use agreements and other things, what we really saw was incredible collaborations happening across the government.""

Kassler said he wants to see the technology used for more everyday use cases, too. One example he gave is how the Centers for Disease Control has already used the technology to help narrow the possible sources of an outbreak linked to produce. Rather than recalling produce from a large region, Palantir can help the agency trace the supply chain and pinpoint a smaller target.

""We don't know what the next pandemic will be,"" Kassler said. ""So we have to be prepared. And in order to do that we have to have invested in the systems that are able to have that situational awareness and to be able to enable organizations to respond quickly.""",['IBM'],,,,,,,

n392a4,,stocks,post,1619970274,"Twitter (TWTR) has done basically nothing in its entire publically-traded historyI started investing in late 2013 and TWTR was the hot IPO at the time. I distinctly remember buying a few shares at $57 figuring I'd get in on the ground floor of what was already a culturally-significant company. 

Amazingly, over 7 years later the stock is trading lower than where I bought it all those years ago. TWTR has never paid a dividend or split their stock, so in effect they've created zero wealth for the general public over their entire public existence. I sold my shares for a wash in 2014, but I'd have been shocked to hear they'd still be kicking around the same spot in 2021. In an era of social media, digital advertising and general tech dominance, it's a remarkable failure.

On the one hand it provides a valuable lesson that a company still has to succeed financially, and not just have a compelling narrative. Pay attention to the bottom line - hype alone does not a business make. On the other hand, what the hell? Twitter has created verbs. It's among the most-visited websites in the world.

Now Twitter has created Spaces as their new innovation, which is just a copycat of what the new social media website Clubhouse does, audio chatrooms.   


Jack Dorsey also owns Square and Cashapp and both of those services have expanded to meet the needs of consumers on multiple fronts to make themselves useful time and time again, but for some reason he always just views Twitter as this ""free speech haven"" and never leaned in creatively to expand it into a service that does more than blast someone's thoughts to everyone else.

n3vqmp,,stocks,post,1620047705,"Uranium market update, one of the biggest catalysts to date is about to be in place.To say we had an interesting few weeks in the uranium sector would be a massive understatement. We have seen new geopolitical support for nuclear power and a massive new catalyst in the form of the newly formed Sprott Uranium Trust (more on that later). There was also a new version released of the Bear Traps Report, a popular type of newsletter that in the words of John Quakes is “send to thousands of Wall Street money managers”. It is also believed that the initial run up was sparked by the sharing of a similar Bear Traps Report article around November/December of last year, sparking the first leg up with institutional capital positioning in the sector. There is \*a lot\* happening beneath the surface and the coming few months will, in my view, prove to be significant.

Here is the first part of the Bear Traps Report with my own added comments as well:

In 2020, six nuclear reactors were connected to the gnd. Of these, Belarus and the UAE opened their first nuclear reactors. This, despite the pandemic. We expect this trend to continue over the balance of the century. There are currently 108 planned nuclear reactors globally at various stages of the approval funding process. Different countries get different percentages from nuclear reactors, a sample: China, 4.9%; India, 3.2%, Japan, 7.5%, UK 15.6%, USA, 19.7%. The take away is that between China, the UK and the USA, alone, there is plenty of potential growth in nuclear reactor electricity supply and, of course, these countries have the financial wherewithal to fund the requisite nuclear reactors to go green should consensus so direct.

Production from mining (in tonnes U) for 2019 was. 22,808 from Kazakhstan: 6,938 from Canada, 6,613 from Australia, 5,476 from Namibia, estimated 3,500 from Uzbekistan 2,983 from Russia, estimated 1,885 from China, 801 from Ukraine, and 67 from the USA Production in the U.S. has been in steady decline: 2014 = 1,919, 2015 = 1,256, 2016 = 1,125, 2017 = 940, 2018 = 582, 2019 = 67. 

The main takeaway here is there is a seemingly strong geopolitical risk component to Uranium supply. U.S. production has essentially evaporated, an extremely bullish fact for forward Uranium pricing given Biden's pro-nuclear stance. Production of Uranium concentrate in the U.S. has fallen steeply and steadily (pounds U308): 2,422,789 for 2017, 1,446,496 for 2018, 173,875 for 2019. In the first quarter of 2020-8,989 vs 58,481 in first quarter 2019 vs 226,780 first quarter 2018 and 450,215 first quarter of 2017.  
 

Overall, nuclear power provides about 11% of global electricity output. Demand grows alapually in the single digits. Because of low prices, global Uranium supply is down 25%. If prices double, mines will reopen and consolidate. If the U.S. alone decides to go big on nuclear prices will at least double. And assuming prices double, supply will be adequate to power U.S. nuclear ambitions. It goes both ways. The U.S. produces but 7% of its own demand, with 93% dependent on imports. ""For strategic issues such as power supply and defense, this is not a healthy situation, and therefore the plan was made for a strategic stockpile, ""Gabi Schneider, the executive director of the Namibian Uranium Institute, explains, adding it is ultimately the US's goal to expand uranium production domestically in order to shrink, or halt outright, U.S. imports of Uranium. 

The U.S. goverment's Uranium strategic stockpile effort passed last December is a key, and telling, first step. At the state level, legislatures have begun passing laws that set up support for nuclear reactors. This represents a big shift from half a century ago. The Biden administration is pro-nuclear power. China's nuclear reactor capacity is set to grow from 46 GWe in 2020 to 108 GWe by 2030. We expect ground to be broken for nuclear reactors over the balance of this decade in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Poland. Projects have begun in Turkey, Bangladesh and Egypt. So it's not just a question of the wealthiest countries jumping in. 

Consensus thought on Uranium has been remarkably stupid, missing the supply cuts, missing the 5x move in conversion prices (UF6), missing the 40% rise in SWU (enrichment) prices, and missing the recent run up in spot prices (U308). Basically, consensus can't even think one step ahead when it comes to basic economics. It didn't occur to them that money losing mines would be shut down.

The US needs to guarantee greater uranium supply. For that it needs U.S. mines to reopen and consolidate. For that Uranium prices have to double. The new U.S. Uranium stockpile could prove a key component to that price shift. Uranium just entered supply deficit Kazakhstan's Uranium production forecast is for its Uranium production to peak next year and to go into serious decline post 2030.

&#x200B;

All of this comes down to one simple fact, it is that we are running out of time for uranium prices to get going and the longer this doesn’t happen, the higher the eventual price overshoot to try and make up for a decade of lost capex investments and exploration. If utilities come to the table within the next 12 months, some form of price control can be asserted and perhaps a slower run up into a price of roughly 60-65 dollars with a small overshoot to around 80 dollars by 2024 might be the most probable scenario. If they don’t though, we might be looking at triple digit uranium once more. One massive new catalyst that was brought to the table recently was the fact the coming into existence of the Sprott Uranium Trust. The bear traps report names 9 reasons why this will likely have significant implications for the broad uranium market:  


Uranium Participation Corp was a company that was buying U and sitting on it, the original yellow cake. The market will now have daily price discovery and a retail / family office / small asset manager speculation vehicle. This is a game changer. Now we have a new team taking over (Sprott). Very bullish for uranium. Why? Here is why:

1. We are getting a U.S. listed vehicle with a physical redemption Like a GLD for uranium. Look at PSLV and PHYS, equivalent.

2. A new mechanism for retail, institutional. An at the market facility. Technically a closed end fund, NOT a GLD.

3. Pounds come in, don't go out. They could do a buyback if the market provides that opportunity.

4. Uranium Participation Corp is tough to buy, pink sheet. Many online brokers didn’t offer it, but now there will be a new liquidity vehicle that is far more widely available.

5. Management transition from Denison to Sprott. Think Industry player to real asset mgr.

6. When there is large premium new buyers are vulnerable. This has suppressed upside momentum NOW there is a liquid vehicle, large buyers can come in with a liquidity work out.

7. Next, Sprott does a big offering to bring in new pounds into the fund. There was too much inventory of uranium in the system, this vehicle will eliminate this problem. New size buyers of the fund will quickly translate into spot buying!

8. Think CME and oil this could be a new real franchise /a liquidity central facility

9. Management take over might take 2/3 months. Then the premium U Part will come in, was 16% today in a month or so Dan Loeb can come in and buy $100m without the premium risk pounds will permanently be removed from the mkt NOT an ETF, it’s a closed end fund. A discount may develop in the shares but new buyers are in a much better spot.

That marks the end of this uranium market update and I hope you enjoyed the read. With so much happening both in front as well as behind the scenes, hopefully I can be of aid to help you traverse this opaque market in the best way possible. We are at the foot of what will undoubtably prove to be a generational event, but it will be an extremely volatile and wild market all the way up and eventually down as well. If you got any questions or comments, my dm’s are always open. As always I wish you all a good and healthy rest of your day and good luck out there in the markets, cheers!","['LEG', 'CME']",,,,,,,

n3uzfe,,stocks,post,1620045628,"Want to know what's happening with APHA & TLRY today? Read this!Today APHA & TLRY [announced](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-aphria-announce-closing-transaction-creates-new-tilray) that the merger is officially closed. Yay! Ok, but what does this mean for my stock??

**If you were a holder of APHA** shares as of 4/30/21 (Friday), each of your APHA shares will turn into 0.8381 shares of TLRY. This means that if you had 100 APHA shares, you will now have 83.81 shares of TLRY. **Keep in mind there are NO fractional shares.** This means that if your shares come out to 83.81, you will only receive 83 shares of TLRY. That number is always rounded DOWN, not up and there will be NO CASH to compensate you for your fractional share (so you can lose at most 0.99 shares of TLRY depending on how much APHA you have - which is like \~$18.56 (if TLRY is at $18.75))

**If you were a holder of TLRY shares** you are STILL a holder of TLRY shares. Nothing changes for you. In the announcement, the company mentions the TSX listing, but this is a [DUAL LISTING](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duallisting.asp). TLRY will continue to trade on NASDAQ. TLRY will ALSO trade under the symbol ""TLRY"" on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) starting May 5th. Really nothing for you to do here, just gives you the ability to trade them on either exchange - it provides extra liquidity.

Another thing to keep in mind is the ""back office"" - this happens at big banks and at big hedge funds too. APHA has HALTED today and will no longer trade. TECHNICALLY you now own TLRY shares that were given to you in the merger. When those show up in your account and you have the ability to freely trade those depends on what broker you use. If you're worried about it - call them. If you want to buy TLRY today, you can. Just go buy more and then the APHA shares that converted to TLRY will be added to your position when everything settles with your broker.","['NDAQ', 'IR']",,,,,,,

If there is a general overall pullback in the market, the stocks arkk is in, will be affected deeply. I do not therefore trust ARKK to make the same gains because as inflaion and higher rates slowly come back in the picture, the highly speculative stocks might see a deeper pull back.

When SPY first came on the scene in 1993, it was priced around $44 (from what I’ve researched). My question is, how did that number come to be?

I’ve been doing a bit of research into ETF pricing. I understand that ETF prices are determined by their daily NAV (unless I’m mistaken here), but how does the initial figure get decided on? Because an ETF float isn’t capped per se, I’m finding it hard to understand versus a regular stock.

As a sidebar, I’d also love to know how/if this is different to actively managed ETFs like ARKK, for example. How did they set their initial price of around $20 and how does the price get influenced day to day?

There is always some noise in the market price, but if the fund owns publicly traded/liquid accets, it doesn't make much sense to value the fund at anything other than the combined value of those assets.

The difference between passive and active funds is just strategy. Passive funds generally have low fees, and over time that effect accumulates, so it can be significant. That's why an active fund has to beat the market/index to get ahead. Often they don't.",,,,,,,,

The Transaction involved an approximate $240 million merger of reorganized entities resulting in GunBroker.com and certain affiliates becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AMMO (the “Transaction”).

“We couldn’t be more excited about bringing the GunBroker.com team into the AMMO family. Everyone worked hard to make this happen - and we will now set about to further expand the GunBroker.com brand as we leverage the amazing IT platform Steve Urvan and his team developed to bring AMMO products and a host of other products and merchandise to the vibrant GunBroker.com marketplace,” said Fred Wagenhals, AMMO’s Chairman and CEO. Fred further noted that “the AMMO management team viewed the Transaction as accretive to our shareholders when we announced the letter of intent. With the Transaction successfully closed, our team has reached another vertical integration milestone for the Company, representing an opportunity to diversify our revenue base with high profit-margin business offered through a premier brand deploying best-in-class secure transactional technology.”

Steve Urvan commented: “I am excited we have closed the Transaction so I can take my seat on the Board of this dynamic and growing company. I am confident our newly expanded AMMO team will bring innovative products and solutions for our expanding and loyal customer base. The GunBroker.com marketplace is going to enjoy the new shopping opportunities that serve the firearms, ammunition and accessory outdoor and shooting sports markets as we roll them onto the platform.”

n427qf,,stocks,post,1620063562,"APHA & TLRY Holders - Don’t panic! Here's what happens to stocks when mergers close...Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, do you own research. 

**TL;DR – Some brokers are taking their sweet time with these shares. MOST companies are down day after a merger and then rebound in the coming weeks. Sit tight!**

Ok, so we’ve all figured out what happens to our APHA and TLRY shares now that the merger is closed (Right? Right!). If you’re still confused, check out [THIS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphria/comments/n3uylv/still_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_your_apha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from earlier. 

Feedback on my prior post is that SOME brokers have changed your position to reflect your TLRY shares (TD Ameritrade for the win) and some have not (get your shit together, RH). Either way, you will get those shares (hopefully) soon and all will be well with the world.

BUT WAIT! TLRY is down $1.20 today… WTF?!? 

A few things to note - There are a lot of market dynamics at play here:

1. There were hedge funds with prior positions that now need to rebalance. 

2. There are people who were only holding on the APHA for the merger and now want to sell.

3. There are ETFs that will likely have some sort of rebalancing.

4. Shorts may be covering on the weakness today.

5. This is a liquidity event – expect volatility.

We can expect a decent amount of choppiness around TLRY the next few days. “But grey\_patagonia\_vest how do you know?!?” Well kids, I did some good old fashion data analysis. 

I pulled a list of all mergers with the following criteria:

1. Both target and acquirer are publicly traded on a North American exchange

2. The deal terms (like APHA/TLRY) were either all stock or at least some cash and some stonks

3. Any mergers with an equity value >$500mm USD (some of the smaller ones can get funky)

I then looked at the performance of the acquirer (like TLRY in this case) – after the deal closed. I started with the stock price of the acquirer 30 trading days before the merger closed, then looked at 7 days before, one day before, one day after, one week after, one month after, three months after, six months after and finally a year after. Here is what I found…. 

Of the 214 deals that fit this criteria… \~56% of acquirer stocks were down the day after a merger closed (as measured from the day before), so TLRY is in good company. Of these 56%, the companies were down an AVERAGE of 3% (TLRY currently down \~6%). Then, of those companies that were down on day one, 19% of them were back up after a week, 38% after a month and 48% after 3M. Those 48% that were up after 3M were up an average of 14% from the day before the merger. If TLRY behaved that way, we’d see TLRY @ $20.90 before long. 

What does this mean for TLRY? It takes some time. This is no guarantee and this definitely isn’t financial advice, but **today’s trading likely isn’t an indicator of future performance.**",['MMM'],,,,,,,

I bought TGT at slightly above a $100 watched with horror as is dipped for several month on end, I sold it, and now a year later is at $211 

I refused to by Amazon when it was rising everyday to reach almost $3000, waiting for a dip, then finally I got it at a little below $3000, sat on it for a a couple of month not seeing any recovery or action, sold as soon as it crossed $3000, missing a potential $400 if I had waited.

**Week of 5/3/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.

Manufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit & factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity & labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings.

The average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM.

Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...”

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

n42k48,,stocks,post,1620064339,"DD (Coupang - The Korean e-commerce Giant)This post will be about the DD I did on Coupang at the end of March. Although the stock has dropped slightly since then and have mostly been trading sideways, I thought I would share my thoughts about this company before they report earnings on May 12.

 

\- **Coupang** ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): 쿠팡) is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It is incorporated in [Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupang#cite_note-2)

\- Coupang is founded by South Korean businessman Bom Kim who dropped out of Harvard Business School after 6 months.

\- Currently Coupang is the largest e-commerce company in South Korea

&#x200B;

 **Business Model** 

 \- “We are building the future of commerce” -- Coupang S-1

\- A key competitive advantage of Coupang is what they call their ”Rocket Delivery Service”

\- This includes their Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Arriving before 7am if ordered before midnight or later in the day if ordered in the morning (this makes purchasing perishable items such as produce convenient).

\- They promise next-day or faster delivery on nearly 100 percent of orders.

\- Coupang claims that 70 percent of the South Korean population lives within 7 miles of a Coupon Logistics Center

&#x200B;

 **Opportunity** 

 

**- Korean Attractive Commerce Market**

Korea is the fourth largest economy in Asia. In addition, South Korea has the following key traits:

* High Mobile Penetration
* Retail Competitive Landscape
* Lifestyle

**- Coupang has an extremely integrated model. From the technology to the distribution**

&#x200B;

 **Risk** 

 

* Operation results might fluctuate significantly
* Future growth rate is hard to predict as the company aims to forgo short-term profitability for long-term growth
* If the company loses its senior executive members, it might not be able to fulfill its current vision.
* The company has had multiple years of large losses.

 

**Financials** 

 

* Total Net Revenue: 11.967 billion dollars (2020)
* Cost of sales: 9.98 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating, general, and administrative expenses: 2.51 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating loss: 527 million dollars (2020)
* Cash and Cash equivalents: 1.25 billion dollars (2020)
* Long-Term Debt: 353 million dollars (2020)
* Total Liabilities: 5.67 billion dollars (2020)

 **IPO** 

 

* Coupang went public earlier this month offering 130 million shares at $35 each, giving the company $4.55 billion 
* The stock closed at $49.25 on its first day.
* Coupang closed at $48.75 today (March 30, 2021). \*41.90 at end of April 30th

 **Valuation** 

 

\- 2020 total net revenue was 12 billion, assuming growth of 100 percent, the 2021 total net revenue would be 24 billion.

\- Using a forward P/S ratio of 5, we get the valuation of 120  billion dollars. Divided by 1.54 billion outstanding shares I get a 12-month price target of **77.922  dollars.**

**- This represents a 60 percent increase from the closing share price today.**

&#x200B;

 **Why We Should Invest in Coupang** 

 

* Household name: There are almost nobody in South Korea now who has not heard of Coupang before. Their status in South Korea is similar to that of Amazon in the US.
* Overseas Expansion: Coupang can achieve such a high-level of revenue and revenue growth without even entering foreign markets. Entering other Asian markets could potentially increase revenue by an even larger percentage
* Rapidly decreasing operating losses. While still not profitable, profitability is definitely achievable within a few years.
* Less political uncertainty: With US-China tensions rising, Coupang is a safe alternative for those who want to invest in Asia.

Mine would be:

Tesla - Perhaps a little overpriced here, but from what I've seen, demand for Tesla cars are through the roof. The model 3 was the best selling car of that type in Q1 on the globe.

I also think Tesla's energy side of things doesn't get much attention. In my opinion, the vehicles are just an initial revenue line to build the brand. The energy is where the 2T+ market cap will come from. 

Robotaxis is also a very interesting proposition. If Tesla gets that nailed down, I can't see Uber and Lyft being in the market much longer. 

Skillz - mobile gaming is growing rapidly and will eclipse consoles within a few years imo. The traditional ad based model of games is becoming outdated. Skillz allows gamers to compete with eachother for cash (in $1, $5, $10, $20) in head to head games. This is far more engaging than traditional game models. 

They also have an anti-cheat system in place to ensure all games are fair.

I think there would be sufficient liquidity for most of the time; the US market is one of the most extensive and prominent in the world. In fact, I live in the UK and I actually like the US market more than the UK one, due to the stocks and the reliability of it.

To summarize, I’m finding some consistency but for some reason I feel like I’m not allowed to feel good about it. Reflecting back on most of my trades in my limited experience, I see how so many of them were luck and chance. But now I’m finding some success with actual technical analysis and “experience”. 

The strong majority of my recent trades have been ones where I did DD, looked thoroughly at the charts and patterns, direction, news, etc. I was right on them and I know the reason I was right was because I took time on them and did my research.

After that limit, then start contributing towards your Roth IRA. Most 401k's have a limited selection of funds to invest in (unless your 401k service provider allows for something self-directed like ""BrokerageLink""), so you'll have more options in a Roth IRA.

For me, I contribute 5% of my pre-tax salary, and my employer will contribute 4% of my pre-tax salary to my 401k. I cap it at that limit, and then contribute the annual maximum towards my own Roth IRA. Once I meet that limit, I invest any other available money into my own brokerage account. I don't max out the $19,500 annual contribution limit in my 401k because I personally feel I can do better than the 401k investing options in my Roth IRA and brokerage account.",,,,,,,,

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
> # Big jobs report
> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
> # Earnings soar
> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

> # Here Comes Sell In May

> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

> # Wild Data Close To Q1

> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**

> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

I know other brokerages restricted GME/AMC. But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. 

Now that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again.","['GM', 'AMD', 'AAL', 'SBUX']",,,,,,,

I think I would rather trust the one posted to the brokerage's platform when doing DD...

Has this happened to anyone? Is anyone on the inside of any of these organizations that could explain the doublemindedness? My thought is that some articles are written to just be wrote and stir the pot while analyst reports come from actual employees.

n3gkmr,,stocks,post,1619991337,"Electric utilities as an EV play?So I’m sure this isn’t an entirely original thought but I wanted to know what people think about this theory.

People always say to sell shovels during a gold rush. For EVs that typically brings to mind battery makers and materials that are needed for batteries. But nobody ever talks about the even more obvious need: electricity! How are people going to drive that shit around if they can’t power it?

Electricity use around the world is going to skyrocket once you start having millions of EVs plugged in at all times. That energy needs to come from somewhere and the state of our current electric infrastructure is not going to cut it. Which means major investments are going to have to be made in strengthening the grid. IMO electric utility companies are in a great position to ride this wave.

It might not bring in as much money as investing in an actual automaker, but my fear is that the Teslas and Volkswagens of the world are going to cannibalize each other at some point. People aren’t going to start buying more cars just because they’re EVs. They just want any car that’s good quality, and if it happens to be EV then that’s great.

I'm sure there are other parts of the USA that are hot spots for EV adoption. The specific utilities that serve those areas will be the first to see a huge bump in demand.

**Who is going to pay for this?**

We the people. Well more like we the 1%ers. And corporations. 

Again, I made more [charts](https://imgur.com/a/zFFfyGJ) to visualize it a bit better. 

So unless you're a high earner, this won't affect you (much). I made these charts about a week or two ago but I heard for the American Families Plan, individuals earning more than $452,700 and married couples earning more than $509,300 (meaning each partners could earn less than $400,000) could see a tax increase.

&#x200B;

**What do you mean, ""won't affect you (much)""?**

If there's tax increases for the rich, what will the rich do? They'll take their stock market gains before the tax increases. 2020 saw huge gains so we may see a correction in the coming months. How much of a correction you ask? I don't know but I would guess 10-15% in the broader market. More if you're into speculative high growth stocks. I say that because I know a lot of you have positions on them. Careful how you invest these next few months.

And if there's tax increases for corporations, obviously they'll do whatever they can to avoid them. However even a 1% increase in their taxes (note below I mention that many corporations pay very little taxes because of loopholes) will affect their bottom line. This means earnings will be less and therefore lower stock valuations.

**So if the rich sell and corporations are being taxed more, how will that affect the stock market?**

1. Less incentive to invest due to more taxes. People will look to other investments or stay cash. (Seriously though, the tax plan won't make a huge difference unless you're a 1%er.)
2. Bonds become more [favorable](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/government-bonds#:~:text=Income%20from%20bonds%20issued%20by%20state%2C%20city%2C%20and%20local%20governments,where%20the%20bond%20was%20issued). Income from bonds issued by state, city, and local governments (municipal bonds, or munis) is generally free from federal taxes. You will, however, have to report this income when filing your taxes. Examples: MUB, HYD, VOHIX, VWAHX.
3. ETFs and Mutual funds are more favorable. They both are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your earnings. ETFs, however, have an advantage over mutual funds due to three reasons: 1) 2018, 89% of ETFs were passive vs. 4% of mutual funds. Less trading involved with passive. 2) Any high dividend or high interest paying securities will receive more distributions, therefore a high tax bill. 3) ETFs have greater liquidity as they are traded during market hours vs. mutual funds are traded at the beginning and end of market sessions.

\*In 2018, Goldman Sachs did a study that showed 100% of their ETFs did not pay capital gains. Broadly, 90% of ETFs did not pay capital gains compared to 39% of mutual funds.

4. Tax advantaged accounts like Roth IRA and 401K are more favorable. If you're one of the super rich, take a look at the [backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp). It's a way for super rich people to put money into retirement without the contribution limits. Roth IRA contribution limit is $6,000 per year. BUT if you make more than $140,000 as a single or $206,000 filing jointly as married then you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. The easiest way to get by this is converting a traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account.

&#x200B;

What does history [say](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/tax-hikes-history#:~:text=In%20the%2013%20previous%20instances,the%20data%20in%20the%20calendar) about stock market performance after tax increases?

""In the 13 previous instances of tax increases just since 1950, the S&P 500, the stock index that tracks most of the major companies in the US, has shown higher average returns, and higher odds of an advance, in times when taxes are increasing, according to Chisholm's research, which analyzed the data in the calendar year of the tax changes, plus the year prior and year after. This pattern holds true even when you drill down into key sectors of the S&P 500."" Here's a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2MaBjOp.png) of the S&P500 performance after tax increases. Not too bad eh?

&#x200B;

**What's happening now with the current tax law?**

* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes. Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM are some of those companies. Corporate tax rate is currently 21%.
* 56 Fortune 500 companies paid 0-5% on their 2018 income.
* 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. I couldn't find any data on this but its due to loopholes in the tax system.

**The Made in America Tax plan**

* Will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis.
* Increase corporate tax rate at 28% from 21%
* Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate.
* The proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries.
* The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations.
* Invert the current law in which U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States.
* A proposal that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. Instead a tax credit will be proposed to support onshoring jobs.
* Invert a Trump tax law for “Foreign Derived Intangible Income” (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&D. Instead the revenue will be used to expand more effective R&D investment incentives.
* Enact a minimum tax of 15% on large corporations’ book income.
* Eliminate tax preferences (worth billions of dollars) for fossil fuels and make sure polluting industries pay for environmental clean up.
* Increase enforcement for tax evasion. Typical workers’ wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent.

&#x200B;

**So what should I do to prepare if this bill passes?**

Nothing different honestly. Keep investing. DCA - dollar cost average if your stocks drop. Stay the course in your high conviction names. De-risk if you have to by investing in safer investments like index funds or ETFs. I know a lot of you are into SPAX (special purpose acquisition companies. I spelled it this way in case this sub banned the real acronym) and other speculative companies. There's almost 500 of them out there. 217 of those were from 2020. To be honest, 1% of those companies will moon. Most of them won't see a return for years. Are you willing to hold them without knowing they will moon in 5-10 years? Some may not even make a return. Make sure you understand market conditions. Stocks really do go up but its only the ones that are backed by strong earnings and potential. Don't get burned. Money is not everything but it's a tool to bring you financial freedom sooner in life.

But it leaves out the biggest thing: 

What happens to the economy, and the 99%, when your neighbor suddenly gets a great paying job on an infrastructure project?  He goes from sucking up social assistance dollars to being a taxpayer.  That's huge.

And when he gets that job, he gets confidence to lease that new vehicle.  And when he leases that vehicle, people at the dealership get hired.  And when they get hired, they go buy some clothes.  And that causes the apparel store to hire more people.  And when those people get hired, they flip from sucking up social assistance dollars to paying a modest amount of tax.  And when those newly proud job holders are feeling good, they patronize local restaurants, which creates and enhances jobs.  And when things are going decently well for all those people, they book vacations, and upgrade their housing, and do some landscaping, and get their nails done, and buy some pet supplies.

It's a very powerful, and very effective virtuous cycle.  Bottom up works, trickle down doesn't.

n36lrg,,stocks,post,1619962827,"Let's talk II-VI Inc. ($IIVI)So I recently came across this company which looked quite interesting to me, given the large variety of usecases for their technologies in growing sectors. I'll try myself at a little writeup to provide some context and serve as a basis for discussion. I'd love to get some opinions and CC from more experienced traders, since this is my first time researching a stock.

So IIVI defines itself as follows:

>""II-VI Incorporated is a global leader in  engineered materials, optoelectronic components and optical systems  offering vertically integrated solutions for applications in industrial,  communications, aerospace & defense, life sciences, semiconductor  capital equipment, automotive and consumer electronics."" (taken from their [website](https://ii-vi.com/))

 Their [customers](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=IIVI) are names like Apple, Facebook and Boeing, among others.

Looking at their financials, they seem to be doing alright. Given their numerous [acquisitions](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyII-VI-Incorporated), with a pretty significant recent purchase of Coherent (COHR), an increase in revenue as well as accumulating debt mid-term is to be expected. (data taken from [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IIVI/financials?p=IIVI))

* steadily growing revenue, gross profits and free cashflow
* continuously beat earnings expectations for past 4 quarters

but also increasing debt, and a relatively bad 2020, with a negative EPS of -0.79. 

As mentioned, IIVI has recently acquired COHR, rendering them the leader in the laser technology sector. 

The closing price of IIVI was 67$ on friday, which is a 33% discount from ATH. They had dropped previsously during the COHR acquisition bidding wars, but had temporarily recovered up to 83$ after winning them. Current downwards movement is likely caused by uncertainty regarding their upcoming earnings call on May 6th.

I see potential for a pretty decent recovery mid- to long-term, granted that currently the growth and innovative tech sectors are not looking to hot.

The Coherent purchase was big but they had to outbid Lumentum to do it, so I agree that debt could be a big drag in the medium-term. The company was doing well but competition in lasers and robotics has been heating up so I think the Coherent merger could be a make-or-break bet for II-VI.

So I am interested in trading for a long time and it is difficult for me to have a realistic view on this.

On the one side you connect trading with rich and succesful people, on the other side it is very good if you get +10% a year.

To be honest, I want to invest like 100 bucks a month into this, which would lead to 120 bucks a year if I am really succesful.

This simple math made me a bit sad and I was wondering if its really profitable to start with trading.

What do you experienced guys think about my thoughts? Would something like risky daytrading be more interesting for me? 

Thanks for your advices!



Edit 1: Thanks to all of your answers. So many people say invest in stable stocks and if you are lucky, you can get 10% out of it or lose 10%. But beside small differences it is the same in my eyes. With daytrading I can stop at 10% win or loss, its just in a very much shorter time.

If I would look for 10% win in a year, I would plant strawberrys and sell them for much more^^

n2wwda,,stocks,post,1619921431,"Waste Management (NYSE: $WM) stock DD i wrote for a discord I'm inWhen searching for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord, I initially was struggling to land on a company. There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.","['WM', 'RSG', 'HBI']",,,,,,,

If Jassy is half as good as Bezos, their ability to succeed in any market will make them incredibly robust -- while avoiding concerns about becoming a monopoly in any one area. eCommerce is still a small fraction of overall commerce, and AWS is a profit machine.

I'm also heavy on Apple and Microsoft, but a bit less. Apple has an incredible hardware side, with innovations like the M1 chip likely to result in massive sales for years to come. But it also recognizes that it needs to transition from hardware (phones specifically) to software in order to maintain their growth rate -- their ability to diversify into a services model will be important for their long-term success. They have no cloud computing, which to me seems odd as it would be a natural extension of iCloud and an easy profit maker. I'm also a bit worried about the $90B share buyback -- while it's good for shareholders like me short-term, it implies that they have no better use for the money, like R&D. It might be evolving into a value company, not a growth company, which in tech is a dangerous thing.

Microsoft is the safest option -- it trades at a low multiple, is well diversified, and has a great CEO. Azure will keep them growing for the next several years, although it does have tough competition. The main reasons it's not my dominant position: they haven't had the same historical growth rate as Amazon or Apple, are pretty weak in the hardware department (particularly when compared to Apple), and don't have a great reputation among consumers for quality (few people really like MS Office or Windows, they just don't have other options in most circumstances).

I don't have Google or Facebook. I like Google, and I plan on adding to it if there's an opportunity. I'm a bit less enthusiastic about it, because it has less of a moat than the others and has had a recent run-up in price, so I don't think it's a bargain right now.

I'm most bearish on Facebook. They almost have an anti-moat; a ton of people younger than 40 really hate the company and its leader. Their main site will diminish in significance as demographics shift, so they need to keep acquiring the next trendy social media site to stay relevant. I view that as a dangerous game -- maybe they can pull it off, but it seems like much more of a gamble than the others. 

Warren Buffet made a good point in his recent shareholder meeting -- none of the top 20 companies by market cap from 30 years ago are still in the top 20. No one could've realistically predicted the current top 20 back then, and several of them didn't even exist then.

n2ud90,,stocks,post,1619912185,"About 87% of Companies in the S&P have beaten analyst estimates, set to be the higgest beat rate on record since 1994https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-blow-out-us-earnings-suggest-market-has-room-run-2021-04-30/

Article for those who want to scroll through quickly:

U.S. companies are leaping above expectations on first-quarter earnings, giving investors stronger confirmation that profit growth will be able to support the market this year.

A big piece of that growth is coming once again from technology and growth companies, which suggests greater durability in companies that underperformed more economically focused value names for months.

Earnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows. With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

About 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.

Some strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.

""The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that's because you're seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there's still more room,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

The high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.

Citing stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index (.SPX) was last at about 4,180.

Stocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.

Earnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.

However, ""tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That's what I find amazing,"" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.

""Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,"" he said.

Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), Cummins Inc (CMI.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).

The first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.

Value has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index (.RLV) remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index (.RLG) is up about 8% in that time.

Technology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv's data.

Tech (.SPLRCT) is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.

While the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.

""It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

""We're actually carving out a third group ... defensives,"" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now. 

Its hard to find a bearish view on the current market situation when so many companies are beating earnings. Maybe in the short term we'll see some volatility as we finish getting through earnings season, but I don't think we'll see much more falling, if any.","['AAPL', 'SPGI', 'WFC', 'PFE', 'CMI', 'COP', 'JPM', 'ATVI']",,,,,,,

Now I'm not denying the success rates of these funds. I know that over the course of 10 or 20 years only a small percent beat the market. That does not in any way reflect how an individual could perform. Mutual funds with billions under management have so many things going against them that a retail trader doesn't. The first is a management fee. The manager will take somewhere in the ballpark of 1% which starts them off behind. Their career is directly tied to their performance and so there is an incredibly strong incentive to be conservative with any speculation. Due to the size of the funds they can't easily invest in small companies or more obscure opportunities. Also due to the size of the funds they raise the price as they buy and drive it down as they sell getting a worse price on both ends than a retail investor.

There are plenty of literature that retail investors over the long run underperform the market as well the more they tried to pick stocks. 

Recall as well that the average retail investor command what? 500k portfolio? If you beat the market by a whopping 2X (30% as opposed to 15% of the index), you gain an extra 75k. Sounds great right? Except you have spent a lot of time and brain power on DD (and looking at price chart is not DD) to get that extra edge. If you're a professional worker like doctor or lawyer, you will easily clear more than that 75k/year. So that extra edge over the market comes at the opportunity cost, obviously unless you want to half-ass your DD and pray that you get lucky. Whereas a 1% market beat by a fund with 50 billion portfolio can afford to have legions of analyst, Phd, mathematician at their service. 

All in all, retail investors do not usually realize how much time and effort it actually take to do proper research on companies. How many people on this sub actually read carefully all the 10Ks of the companies in their portfolios? And that is only the beginning, the bare minimum, of their DD.

n2hzd3,,stocks,post,1619874389,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

**Performance of Motely Fool Premium Recommendations** 

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|**SPY**|**Change over SPY**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Quarter|6%|3%|3%|
|One Year|24%|11%|13%|
|Two Year|67%|20%|47%|
|Till Date|134%|71%|63%|

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

**Performance of Motely Fool Sell Recommendations** 

&#x200B;

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|
|:-|:-|
|If you followed Fool's Sell Recommendations|134%|
|If you did not follow Fool's Sell Recommendations|167%|

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

n2nmdi,gwktmrn,stocks,comment,1619898545,"So, I work in capital markets for a living, and I had the same reaction as you did when I saw 0% notes issued as part of a PIPE offering - asking myself ""who the fuck would commit capital/buy notes from SNAP without being compensated for it - especially since they're unsecured notes, meaning your fucked in the event of default? That makes zero sense.""

Until I went and looked in the indenture, and this paper is structured in a way that I'd never really thought about or encountered, since it seems like it functions like a call option with no premium (note holders can convert to equity at their discretion any time over the next six years) but in the legal vehicle similar to a SPAC (if you don't exercise the call option available to buy shares at the current strike price - or in the case of a SPAC, the committed capital isn't deployed via deSPAC merger + IPO - the original notional amount is returned to the public share holders / PIPE entities).

>**In connection with the pricing of the notes, Snap plans to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes** or their respective affiliates or other financial institutions, collectively, the capped call counterparties. **The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Snap Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of Snap’s Class A common stock on any conversion of notes** or at Snap’s election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments Snap is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any such converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.

>In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates may purchase shares of Snap Class A common stock or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Snap Class A common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. **This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Snap Class A common stock or the notes at that time.**

This lends the impression that this transaction is part of a broader M&A process. I suspect the private buyers of the convertible notes are an M&A target SNAP is looking to scoop up, but instead of further diluting their current shareholders now by issuing new stock to the target, it appears they're delaying that for some time by issuing the converts and effectively deferring the increase to their cost of capital down the road until if/when the notes are exercised and equity is issued.

NGL, pretty clever way of arranging your cap stack, especially when leverage profile isn't a huge concern. Curious to see what further merger details come out of this, since it's almost guaranteed to be related to part of a bigger acquisition / transaction financing.

Should also note that these notes aren't available for the public to purchase. They're a 144A/PIPE private placement with individuals/entities that pass the income/net asset threshold - probably part of the reason why it makes no sense to those of us relying on publicly available data.",,,,,,,,

As for SNAP's viability going forward, despite debt and lack of profit, many people may not realize there's been a major shift with respect to SNAP that kicked in about six months ago. 

Before that they were regarded as just another money-losing fad that would go away.  But to the analysts' surprise, SNAP managed to cook up viable plans to attract advertisers, and there's lots of evidence it's working.  They've had a couple of billion dollar quarters, and the inflection point of break even to profitable is coming much sooner than most imagined.  I think (?) SNAP has quietly snuck into third place among social plays.

And even the assumption that ""they're not profitable"" is superficial.  If you dig into the details of recent numbers, they could be profitable however they're putting that money into programs that attract influential content, which supercharges user growth.  And it's apparently working.  So the ""losing money"" stat is misleading, and when looked at from a different perspective, could be considered good news, not bad.  As someone who loaded up on AMZN during the final years of people saying ""but they're not profitable"" (while those people weren't noticing that profit or loss were levers controlled by Amazon) it's a familiar pattern that I find tempting.

As they've aged, it's been noted that SNAP has outlasted multiple projections of their death, by innovating.  They were considered a fad of being the disappearing messages app.  They re-invented to do filters, which continue to be inexplicably popular.  They've re-invented to do stories.  They're re-inventing now as group messaging, which is hot, and experiential, which is perfect for the now rebounding travel advertising segment.  It's becoming harder to bet on SNAP just fading away as had always been assumed.  

SNAP is also considered one of the less harmful type of social media and tech plays.  Where FB is considered pure evil, SNAP is considered benign.  Turns out that's good if you want to sell advertising.  

During this earnings season, SNAP weathered it about the best, compared to peers like FB and PINS.   Maybe next week will be SNAP's turn to get beat down, but so far, so good.","['AMZN', 'FB']",,,,,,,
n2ok5c,,stocks,post,1619894699,"I don't understand how dividends affect a stock price.I read today that if a stock is trading at 20.04 and pays a .04 dividend, on ex-dividend day the stock will adjust down to 20.00 to reflect that dividend no longer being available to buyers. 

I got down voted to hell for saying it's not necessarily 1:1 like that, but actually now I'm just confused.  Is it actually 1:1 like that?  Does the stock price adjust down automatically by that exact amount? I was under the impression that prices were only affected by supply and demand.  What about open limit orders?  Do they automatically adjust down by that exact amount? I saw this somewhere. 

Or is it 100% due to market forces?  Since investors know they are no longer entitled to that money on ex-dividend day, they will naturally be willing to pay .04 less for the stock, thus they adjust their bid sizes accordingly.

Now, once such asset is cash. So if a company then choose to give cash out to shareholders, that must logically reduce the worth of the company because we've reduced the assets.

The following is my understanding.

TLDR: Both supply and demand curves move by 4¢ because both buyers and sellers evaluate the return they will get from the stock as 4¢ less. This causes the price to change by 4¢.

Not TLDR: There is no enforcement of a change in price whether by clearing house, computer, or other entity (so far as I know anyway. Hypothetically I guess any of these could try to manipulate the price, but why manipulate to the same spot I expect market forces to take it.) Because information on the dividend is known well in advance the price can change nearly instantaneously in response to the dividend from the moment just before close to the moment just after open, when the stock is no longer entitled to the dividend.

The price decreases approximately 4¢ because approximately everybody knows they will get 4¢ less value from owning it. This applies to both sellers and buyers. 

A trade occurs at what a buyer and seller each consider to be fair by their own evaluation (ignoring exceptions)

Suppose two people were about to trade $20.04 for one share because the seller wanted the cash and the buyer the stock, but they just missed market close and have to wait til the next day. So they come back next morning, both know the stock will provide 4¢ less to the owner, so the buyer now sees their fair price as 4¢ less and likewise the seller, when they evaluate the stock, see it as worth 4¢ less. The buyer offers 4¢ less at $20 (assuming the only thing that changed in their evaluation was that the stock will now provide them 4¢ less return,) the seller accepts what they believe to be a fair offer from the buyer and the price of the most recent trade is now $20 not $20.04 like it would have been the day before.

I saw someone suggest that the dividend comes from the market cap or maybe worded it like it comes out of the stock price in some non market enforced way, I disagree. Market Cap= Shares*Price like you said, the above explains a change in share price in response to a dividend, the market cap follows not the other way around.

Saw another comment about the share price changing because of a post dividend sell off, again I disagree. If there was a sell off or buy up it would be because investors for whatever reason want to get rid of or accumulate shares based on the timing of the next dividend, but it would seem strange to me that this wouldn’t be priced in since dividends in the market happen frequently and if there was always a sell off after a dividend people would learn to expect it, and trade accordingly in anticipation of a loss of value. If there was for whatever reason a sell off or buy up it would be in addition to the expected 4¢ change, that’s my take.

How they work is dependent on a variety of things that are not easy to explain in a quick manner.  I recommend getting on YouTube and doing some research to understand the basics.  This video really breaks it down, no I’m not getting paid to share it, I’m a noob as well and like things dumbed down to me as well. https://youtu.be/ZJjRnKpwDyw. 

With your example though, the price you pay for the option, is what it’s worth, not the price of the shares. For example, let’s say tsla is $100 per share. Tsla is getting ready to release an electric jet fighter so you assume the stock will go up.  You buy an option with the call price of $105 per share for $20.  That means that by a certain day, you can buy 100 shares of tsla at $105 per share, even if the stock price shoots up to $130.  Now, let’s say you don’t have $13,000 to buy the shares, you can sell the option back to the market at more than what you paid for it.  Again, the variables are difficult to explain quickly but it’s essentially based on time, volume, and your prediction.  If you bought 6 contracts at $20, and the stock goes up a dollar, your options will raise in value at what’s called the delta, could be 1 dollar all the way down to fractions of a cent.  So if the stock goes up a dollar and your delta is 1, your option is now worth 21 dollars instead of 20.  BUT, time to expiry, volume, what people are willing to pay, etc all play into that so even if the delta is 1, you might be able to sell your option back at $25.

n2xapg,gwmbwdw,stocks,comment,1619925947,"So I might be somewhat qualified to answer this as I currently have accounts open at TD, Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard and M1.   Long story as to why, but a lot of it has been searching for the right account for my investing style.

What I have found is that I like each one for different reasons, but ones which are relevant to you:

If you want fractional shares, then pretty much you're limited to Fidelity or M1.   Schwab does fractional shares, but only for companies in the S&P 500 and no ETFs.   Interactive brokers is also an option but I don't have an open account over there, and they typically cater to more active traders so I can't provide much information.  I'm sure there are smaller ones out there, but I don't think I'd venture out beyond the ones I mentioned above.

Really I think the option comes down to your investment style - M1 is better for long-term investments which are 'ratio driven'.   For instance:  ""Every week, pull X dollars from my checking account, and then invest automatically to try to maintain a ratio of 60% VTI and 40% VXUS"".    You can manually trade, but the free service only has one trade window - basically all previously-entered trades (including the automatic ones) execute in a window that opens at market open each day and ends when all of the trades are done.    This is fine for long-term investing, not so great if you're trying to time the market.

Fidelity is more of a hands-on approach.  And is better if you're actually buying and selling interactive stocks.   I know some people have gotten around the transfer issue you mention by setting up a monthly schedule on say the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st.   Doesn't make it consistent as far as which day it comes out, and there will often be a missing week at the end of the month.   Another thing to look into is whether you can push money to fidelity from your checking account (perhaps to a fidelity cash management account?) instead of pulling.",['SPGI'],,,,,,,

n2v4ns,,stocks,post,1619914896,"Self Driving Cars and Tesla's FSDDisclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

&#x200B;

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

&#x200B;

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into **perception-planning-control** blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD. Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.

&#x200B;

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 2010s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + HD maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach.

&#x200B;

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about the perception part. As I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years.
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate.
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago.  There are also progresses of LiDAR in thick snow and fogs, check University Waterloo and MIT media lab's works.
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

&#x200B;

Alright, suppose that Tesla successfully solved this perception problem using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next? We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the hardest part. What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents: the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even if the road can be unpaved and covered with leaves.

&#x200B;

The devil lies in busy urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive? How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc., but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the subtle social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties who may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the main reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015-ish. You can find plenty videos of Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver on YT. They can operate in these scenarios, thought not elegantly.  

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Tesla barely touches this today, as you can find in some beta tester's video of FSD in SF.  It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are officially entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. By ""official"" I mean running their driverless cab services for public, but the tech has been tested in many more cities including SF, and they just did not advertise that. 

  
BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach. Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long: Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  Currently FSD beta 8.2's disengagement data shows 10-20 miles per intervention or complete disengagement (again, from beta testers' own video). This metric for Waymo and Cruise last year is 29000 miles, a few orders of magnitude in difference.

However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales POV).

I can understand the argument if the S&P was a static fund, meaning holdings don’t change. But the S&P rebalances 4x a year, adding new companies and removing others.

n2trgw,gwlmudo,stocks,comment,1619911643,"An S&P 500 fund is essentially a managed fund. Stocks are added and removed multiple times a year, like you said, by a committee. It's not an algorithm that chooses the stocks, it's a group of humans.

The S&P 500, by its nature, will ""buy high"" and ""sell low"" because a company already needs to be successful to be added to the index and they remove unsuccessful companies.

There was a study a while ago that found that if you invested in the original list of companies in the S&P 500 and didn't follow the index,  you'd outperform the index by a wide margin. That's because the index has a history of removing companies while they're down and later adding them back when they recover. If you simply held on to the companies, you'd have done better. And that even accounts for the fact that many of the original companies no longer exist.

The index was meant to track the state of the market, not provide the best returns. The fact that it's now a major investment is something the original designers of the index never intended.",['SPGI'],,,,,,,

n2u5o8,,stocks,post,1619911451,"My take on the SPXThis is all Elliot Wave analysis, the only wave analysis I've been using for years.

Last year about a month after the March drop, the S&amp;P500 was at around 2807 points. At this time I used Fibonacci extension which told me that the SPX was heading for around 3542 before heading for a nasty correction.

When I started commenting in the daily chat and posting my analysis, saying that the SPX was heading for 3542 when it was at 2807, everybody called me a dumbass. And I mean everybody.

All the gay bears were out, guys were losing their life savings bleeding and bleeding averaging down more and more. 3542 seemed like such a fucking long shot. Unemployment, vaccine timeline worries, all that propaganda was RAMPANT. We saw all the bears get decimated and the bulls making the easiest money of their lives.

[Here](https://imgur.com/I0NEx0X) is a pic of the Fibonacci extension and what I was calling for at the time.

Well as we know, the S&amp;P500 got to 3588 before correcting for about 2 months, or 58 days. [Here](https://imgur.com/mtpCyod) is the length of the correction.

Well, what does that matter? Why should you give a fuck?

Well, I've used the exact same method to calculate the end of this wave we are currently on.

[As you can see in this zoomed out version](https://imgur.com/uVhPldA) after using Fibonacci extension the end of this wave will be around 4635. I don't know the timeframe, but after that point we are in for a SERIOUS correction. This will fully complete the wave, so expect worse than what we've seen already.

There are five waves which complete before the ABC correction. Right now we are in the third wave. This is usually the longest, most aggressive wave up. We will go into the fourth correction wave at some point, before getting back into the fifth wave and finalizing around 4635. Use this information however you like, I don't really give a fuck if you believe me or not. But since I only commented and didn't create a post last time, I wanted to have some documentation about what's going to happen.

HOW TO PLAY THIS:

1) Low maintenance method : Buy some UPRO and dont even look at it until the SPX is sitting around 4620 and up. The final fifth wave could be extended, meaning it could go a lot higher. But I will probably close positions around this point and watch, maybe ladder some volatility.

2) Options way : Well we know we are going to get to around 4635, with a correction in between. This can be played a few different ways, probably a good method would be calls 3-5 months out. Do the same with long volatility. The only time I would buy shorts is if we get close to 4600 without a big correction. Then I would short, if it falls hard close, then ladder calls as it will correct before hitting the 4635 mark and above.

Anyways, if this doesn't pan out I won't be deleting this post. But I stand by this analysis. When I first looked to see the 3542 I thought something was wrong because of all the bad news and with everything going on. I doubted the analysis. Now I don't. This is a bullish as fuck market. Until it isnt. Then we play the down trend.

n2jk2k,,stocks,post,1619879741,"Let's talk Lumber Gang! Bullish on $BCC and $LPX. Bearish on Home Builders.First DD about something I'm familiar with.

I am currently in FAANG tickers plus MSFT. Earnings were good but the stock is either not moving, or went up and came back down. I’m planning to sell everything I’m green in and move the majority over to something that has been killing it which is lumber. It can add some more variety to this sub.

My husband is in the industry (his company is not publicly traded) and things have been good and bad. It’s been good because people have been paying ridiculous prices for houses. Combine that with the building material shortage and he has been able to raise his profit margins. Very nice commission checks coming home.

It’s bad because there is not enough lumber for everyone and he’s been having hard conversations with builders who don’t get that they will have to slow down because product is running out.

Here are how lumber futures have been doing.

5 Day – 9.45%

1 Month – 48.41%

3 Month – 69.36%

YTD – 72.15%

1 Year – 359.39%

If anyone knows how to invest in futures without receiving actual product I would love to know. Don’t want to be that guy that got a bunch of oil delivered to him.

With how things are going we are going to continue to see a rise in lumber for at least through the summer. The biggest problem is obtaining Engineered Wood Products (EWP) and OSB. Home Depot has quadrupled the price of OSB over the past year. There is also a resin shortage that is needed to make these products. Timber is cheap but the bottleneck is sawmills. Either they have reduced capacity due to covid or they are switching business to OSB because it is more profitable.

I’m looking at companies such as $BCC (38% last 3 months), $WY (23% last 3 months), $LPX (71% last 3 months). They have had great runs and are currently in a dip from the last few days. (Hopefully a dip and not the top).

First companies that will be screwed sooner than later will most likely be home builders. They will soon realize they have been building houses for free and will get hit first. They try to hit a 35% profit margin. That margin is eroding by rising costs but they are under contract. Contracts last about 6 months. So expect their profits to go down. Unless they have been really good at guessing lumber futures and buying appropriately.

Home builders have been hitting highs and could be shorted or have puts placed on them. Just look at the top 10 list of publicly traded developer stocks. Be careful with timing. They’ve had big jumps this last week.

Bear case: The fed could finally raise interest rates which would decrease demand and let supply catch up. More investment can go into building out saw mills. Builders can get creative and use different materials. This is where steel gang can benefit. Supply could eventually catch up but it may take some time. This is a several month play for now.

Current position is shares in $BCC. I've seen nice steady rise over the last few months.

TLDR: Lumber has been on a great run and is getting more scarce. Buy lumber tickers such as $BCC, $WY and $LPX and puts on big home developers. Mid term play.","['MSFT', 'WY', 'HD']",,,,,,,

I doubt mills are going to make capital investments on increased output when according to [FRED data,](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU28000003132110001A) employment of sawmill workers is at historical lows (other states with available data like OR and WA are similar), which implies either they've been divesting production capacity or they have the machines, but not the employees.

n2r411,,stocks,post,1619902104,"Should I be concerned my brokerage turned my ETF holding into a short position?Long story short (no pun intended) back in January I decided to open a Roth IRA account and I invested $12k into a clean energy ETF. After seeing the ETF decline in value to $11k, I transferred the Roth IRA account to a new brokerage & sold the ETF position, now converted into a mutual fund. I then bought xx shares of GME during the recent dip to $160. However, the day after GME opened at $150 before shooting up to $185 after hours, I was shocked to get margin called by the new brokerage 

The brokerage informed me, ""The recent purchase of securities in your account has created a cash call. If this call is not met within the time required by Regulation T, per Federal Reserve Board, portions of your portfolio may be sold to cover this cash call."" Reluctantly and without immediately reaching out to the brokerage for further clarification, I sold my GME shares that same day at $177 for over $1k profit (bringing my account back above $12k for the first time).

What happened next was even more surprising! I let $12.3k cash settle for the T+2 settlement period and assumed that I had been margin called because somehow the initial purchase of GME interfered with the settling of money from my sale of the mutual fund. Instead, after 2 days the mutual fund showed up again in my account as a short position! Now, I believe what happened is the brokerage bought the mutual fund position from me ""on loan"" instead of simply selling it. In one sense this seems to be great because now my account has roughly doubled in value to nearly $24k with the mutual fund short position showing up as a positive asset.

On the other hand, I still want to own xx shares of my favorite stock without risk of being margin called if GME drops in price again due to its inherent volatitlity. So really what I'm wondering is:

* Was the margin call a one-time-only occurrence while my brokerage was setting up the short position in my account, or can it happen again if the value of my stock holdings declines beneath the value of the mutual fund?
* Can I sell the (now $11.5k) mutual fund short position itself for an equivalent amount of cash?
* Why would they even do this to me instead of just seling the mutual fund flat out?
* What happens if I try to transfer the account again to another new brokerage? Would the short mutual fund position get transferred too, or would it have to be unshorted by my current brokerage before I transfer the other stocks and/or cash I hold in the account? 
* Ultimately, does having the short position held in this account as an ""asset"" a positive incentive to stay with this broker, or does it create a crazy ridiculous amount of risk of getting margin called & having to potentially put forward extra cash to cover if my stocks decline rather than agreeing to sell at a loss? (I got super lucky this time!)

I'll probably call the brokerage on Monday for answers but meanwhile it would be great if anyone who has experienced and/or has knowledge about this kind of situation could give me a better idea about what sort of unicorn or beast I might be dealing with!

The company's platform provides access to talent with various skills across a range of categories, including sales and marketing, customer service, data science and analytics, design and creative, web, mobile, and software development. Its platform also enables clients to streamline workflows, such as talent sourcing, outreach, and contracting.

UpWork is posting their earnings after market close on Tuesday May 4th 2021.

Upwork last posted its quarterly earnings results on February 23rd, 2021. The reported $0.01 EPS for the quarter, beating analysts' consensus estimates of ($0.07) by $0.08. The firm earned $106.15 million during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $97.34 million. Its quarterly revenue was up 32.2% on a year-over-year basis.

They beat earnings in February and the stock went up 20% from around 50 to $60+ after hours.

This is a company that should be growing during the pandemic as more people are working and hiring remotely.

You can look at their quarterly and annual reports along with MD&A. 

Alternatively you can look under the SEC website and search the company’s for their 10K’s and 10Q’s. You can also find companies using SEDAR’s website (Canadian equivalent - assuming you’re Canadian from your username). 

You can typically find their share outstanding via their MD&A and some companies report their outstanding shares along with an earnings/share number at the bottom of the income statement. Using their shares outstanding you can calculate whatever you need “per share”.",,,,,,,,

And it has some interesting examples:  


>Manipulation Methods  
>  
>Manipulation takes many forms in the markets. One way people can [deflate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp) the price of a security is by placing hundreds of small orders at a significantly lower price than the one at which it has been trading. Investors get the impression that there is something wrong with the company, so they sell, pushing the prices even lower.  
>  
>Another example of manipulation is placing simultaneous buy and sell orders through different [brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) that cancel each other out. This form of manipulation gives the perception, due to the higher volume, that there is increased interest in the security.  
>  
>These false order techniques are often combined with the spreading of false information through online channels and message boards that other investors may frequent. The outside barrage of bad information combines with seemingly legitimate market signals to encourage traders to pile on or off a trade.  
>  
>The [pump and dump](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pumpanddump.asp) is the most frequently used manipulation to inflate a microcap stock artificially and then sell out, leaving later followers to hold the bag. The opposite of the pump and dump is the less common [poop and scoop](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poopandscoop.asp). The poop and scoop method is used less because it is harder to make a legitimately good company look bad than it is to make an unknown company look amazing.

Ex Dividend Date is the date you need to have OWNED the shares. Buy them BEFORE this date. If you buy them ON this date, I believe that won’t count.

There is a separate Pay Date. Depending on the stock you own it could be yearly, quarterly, or monthly.

If I ever wonder about specific dates and also to look at past dates I just google “XYZ dividend history” and the first result every time is the NASDAQ website.

Example ORC:
[ORC Dividend History](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orc/dividend-history)

Declaration Date is the date they announced the dividend.

Ex/EFF Date is the date you MUST OWN this stock. Buy BEFORE this date.

Payment Date is when you get paid based on what you owned on the Ex Date.

Cash Amount is the amount you’ll be paid per share.


I like this site because gives you a history and how consistent they’ve been and the amount it’s been paid at.


One fun thing to know - is AFTER the Ex Date you can sell those shares and still get the dividend. Make sure you sell AFTER that date though. But be careful as the stock does reduce in price due to the dividend payout. So maybe wait a week or two if you think it’ll continue to grow but want to drop the stock.","['NDAQ', 'GOOGL']",,,,,,,

The key date in terms of receiving that dividend, or not, is the record date, which is usually one day after the ex-dividend date. If you have *settled* shares of the stock on the record date, you are entitled to that dividend payment even if you sell your shares before that dividend is paid.

Since stocks in the US are T+2 settlement, you would need to execute your purchase of the stock the day before the ex-dividend date. That way, it will have settled by close of business on the record date and you will receive that dividend.

Ex: company declares a dividend with ex-date of 2/15, record date of 2/16, and pay date of 3/15. You would need to purchase the shares on, or before, 2/14 to receive that dividend. If you purchased on 2/15 or later, you would not receive the 3/15 dividend payment.",,,,,,,,

Considering he doesn’t want to put any money in the market through his entire career, he probably won’t sleep well at night knowing his “respectable amount” of money, which I assume is his life’s savings, will be in the market even via ETFs. 

If he trusts the banks, going into a mutual fund isn’t always a bad thing. Sure the fees are higher than your average ETF, but if it makes your father sleep well at night knowing that his money is managed by the bank, it is worth it. There are plenty of people that suit the mutual fund type and it’s fine. 

Also consider switching to other HISA banks. There are often promotions you can take advantage of by switching and opening HISAs (at least in Canada) that can grant you 1-2% interest over a 6 month period. It can be a hassle switching banks often, but it can also be worth it to squeeze some extra % more. 

I don’t think you should convince your father to invest his money. Yes, it isn’t the best financial thing to do to have everything in a HISA, but you also don’t want to lose your father’s hard earned money. He might not be able to even tolerate ETF volatility and end up bailing on a market downturn.  It might be better to seek out a financial advisor to help him.",,,,,,,,

> **Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

> The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

> Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

> **Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

> The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

> Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

> Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

> On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

> “Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

> Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

> Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

> Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

> Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

> While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

> The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

I hope I'm wrong, I  but it made me nervous because I do have quite a bit of cash on hand (10k+) that I'm holding to find an investment opportunity. Here's what I found with a bit of research:

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?

However most etfs are priced higher than $60. The reason I have seen in the past is lower bid/ask.

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

n423pw,,investing,post,1620063275,"Waste Management (NYSE: $WM) DD I wrote for my Discord.When searching for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord, I initially was struggling to land on a company. There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.","['WM', 'RSG', 'HBI']",,,,,,,

The next supply squeeze that may take markets by surprise isn’t lithium. It isn’t even a battery metal …

While everyone is distracted by the media barrage surrounding EVs, another commodity may be creating an investment opportunity to rival all …

We think it’s potentially bigger than the cannabis boom that reportedly netted some investors 1,000% gains.

It’s helium.

And some experts say we’re running out of it.

It’s not just a niche commodity anymore. It’s not just about balloons. And we think it’s positioned to become the focus of increased investor interest.  

Like oil and gas, this is about exploration, discovery, and development. And we think the biggest returns may end up coming from the small-cap explorers trying to hit the big time with a new discovery - all on their own.

*Growing Helium Demand*

Demand for helium is increasing, and it’s coming from multiple sectors, including everything from the tech and biomedical industries, to space, medical equipment and national security. And, yes, of course, party balloons and Thanksgiving Day parades.

Many industries require helium.

It’s been reported that the tech industry has been a massive catalyst, and that 2013 was a game-changing year for helium supply.

That’s when the world’s first ‘helium drives’ were made commercially available, making helium a key ingredient to fill our monstrous appetite for data.

Some 3.7 billion people are generating some 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. And even those numbers may grow by up to 60% a year. By 2025, it is projected to be more like 160 zettabytes per year. Helium drives were apparently a breakthrough that replaced the air in hard drives with helium to reduce the energy used. They went from concept to commercialization in 2013.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)--all are said to need tons of it for their massive data centers.

We think demand is set to surge into the helium-driven territory of zettabytes.

And the growing semiconductor market may depend on helium, too. Why? Because helium can bring temperatures down to below -450 degrees Fahrenheit--lower even than liquid nitrogen. This is important for superconducting equipment in particle accelerators and the magnets used to build semiconductors, according to Forbes.

Driving this further is a global computer chip shortage.

In Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Haldron Collider (LHC), the largest high-energy particle accelerator on Earth--and the biggest machine in the world, needs a truckload of helium every week.

Nor does the demand story end there …

The health sector is another major driver of helium demand. It’s also critical for use in cooling magnets in MRI machines. Without helium, we won’t have working MRIs. The shortage also threatens NMRs--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which in turn is a crucial aspect of medical research.

n3jkda,,investing,post,1620000972,"Retail Dragon Portfolio - Week 1 UpdateFirst weekly update on the Retail Dragon Portfolio. A new screenshot can be found [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jSahhfA).

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Chris Cole's Dragon Portfolio Allocations](https://imgur.com/gallery/0JVrDkm)
* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI'],,,,,,,

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful. I obviously regret not putting that money into VTI as my logic (at the time) was that the global recovery will be lead by China:,and since China is the biggest trading partner for some 130+ countries, the ETF will recover nicely.

Now, with political tensions (delisting included) and increasing risks of a new cold war, I'm thinking it may stagnate for the next year or so while VTI climbs. But knowing my luck I suspect that if I do so, VTI will then slow down (stimuli already priced-in) and FLCH will take off.

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile. 

Is it not commonplace to view growth stocks as more volatile than value? Was this view different 15 years ago?",['BLL'],,,,,,,
n3boe2,gws27ff,investing,comment,1620047678,"So, that is a generalized statement, but I think the generalized viewpoint still holds up. 

However, I’m not even sure your statement holds today, as we can easily flip it. We say we view growth as more risky, but how many people are throwing large investments into renewables or EVs?  The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",,,,,,,,
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth. 

People tend to extrapolate recent past performance into the future and view recent decline to indicate continuing decline and recent success to indicate continuing success.",,,,,,,,

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation. 


By 2040, we be at the brute force of water crisis that will be well publicized

I’m 30 years old (USA), recently unemployed due to a medical condition that means I can’t do my old job anymore. I have no idea when I’ll be able to work again in my field, if ever.

Right now, I have $285,000 available to invest (The rest of my savings is for bills, other expenses, etc) and I’m hoping I can invest it so I’ll at least be able to generate some income in the meantime. I have no holdings,  no debt, and no other huge expenses, I’m just unable to work for the foreseeable future.

Right now, my only objective for this money is to preserve what I have while hopefully make 8-10% a year (Before inflation). From what I’ve read, this seems doable without going crazy with risk (Please correct me if I’m wrong).

From my understanding, I’d assume I should just go pick a set of diversified 5-star large-cap ETFs that have generated the returns I’m looking for and hold indefinitely, is that the correct strategy? Like I said before, I’m not looking for crazy returns, just 8-10% would be enough for my needs.

I have a dry powder MM fund in both my taxable brokerage and in my IRAs, and I try to maintain some cash in them to take advantage of black swan events. Last March when the pandemic hit and WTI went negative I made a big move into USL that paid off handsomely.

How much you have in long term investments vs. how much you keep as dry powder really is up to individual temperament.

A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['SPGI', 'TWTR', 'DOW', 'TSLA']",,,,,,,

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

Also Michigan is a right-to-work state and union membership has been declining because of this in recent years (or in this case, growing at a slower rate than the size of the auto industry). Some of the points you made are valid, but electrifying their truck line is a no-brainer when they were humiliated by Tesla's Cybertruck in a towing demonstration. (Argue about the validity of the Cybertruck vs F150 test until the cows come home, it was still an effective piece of marketing).

They're in the alcoholic beverages industry, own vineyards, and produce a wide portfolio of wine brands sold in 50 countries. I'm a big fan of Decoy for producing cheaply priced but great tasting reds. 

They had their IPO last month and their price seems to be stabilizing after yoyoing between $16-20. Facts:

* Market Cap: $2.1b
* Shares: $18.58
* PEG: 0.01
* **PE: 0.04**

This seems like an absolute steal. Competitors in the beverages industry have an average PE of 32.5 and PEG of 0.05 (per TD Ameritrade analytics, anyway). Its a profitable company that has great margins.

The primary downside is their tiny market share in a competitive industry. In 2020, their total revenue was $270mil, versus the industry total of $326**bil** (0.08%). 

What else am I missing? Why is $NAPA valued at such a discount?

n1mz3k,gwefz00,investing,comment,1619769972,"I run 200% long 100% short.  I think using shorts to get more long is the only thing that makes sense for long term investing.  Some short sellers do tactical, shorter term trading and do well being short biased/only short.

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.  What happened late January is shorts mostly became super correlated, and things get dangerous fast.",['AAL'],,,,,,,
n1mz3k,gwf6o1x,investing,comment,1619788281,">In bull markets, I find myself drawn to shorting highly volatile stocks because anything with decent fundamentals seems like a bad choice...but that accordingly increases the drawdowns in my portfolio

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",,,,,,,,
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

Invest at your own risk. The above scenario is incredibly risky and a slight deviation in your math will bankrupt your account, but if correct, it’s a big payday and scaleable with a ton of margin if you choose that risk.",,,,,,,,
n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA. Ironically this probably sets up a good entry to short bubble stocks, of which there are plenty. Be careful of ones with weekly expiries and high short interest; these are prone to gamma manipulation by larger players. It's a game and if there is money to be made in a short squeeze it will be done. 

There is stuff like ARKK which doesn't necessarily have 0 fundamentals but has very high valuations; SPACs which are mostly frauds (e.g. NKLA), meme stocks like MVIS and GME. Go for put spreads instead of outright shorting if you can find a good entry. 

You could go for a more balanced approach and diversify your short book. Solely from valuation you can short MSFT/APPL against long GOOG/FB and I reckon there are many more interesting pairs out there. But there is so much money on the table if the bubble stocks do burst. The call-buying from retail is slowly diminishing as the economy is reopening up; interest rates are rising and I think this is probably a good opportunity to set up some shorts if you can stomach large drawdowns (and you do need conviction to believe that stocks will trade towards their fair value over time).","['MSFT', 'ARKK', 'TSLA', 'FB']",,,,,,,

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']",,,,,,,
n1bg9z,,investing,post,1619722719,"Beijing’s Squeeze on Fragile Real-Estate Developers Is Getting Real - Wall Street Journal ArticleRead the article here: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-squeeze-on-fragile-real-estate-developers-is-getting-real-11619682390](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-squeeze-on-fragile-real-estate-developers-is-getting-real-11619682390)

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.

The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.

>For many years we've seen that ""deleveraging"" in China has meant reducing leverage in one part of the economy while increasing it in another. This isn't incidental. It is fundamental to the way the growth model works. ""

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",,,,,,,,

If they can't even produce natural gas from the field, and are calling it a pure helium field, that's a joke. Absolutely no revenue in the past 3 years, and they lose between 1-3 million each year. I have no hopes they can produce helium.",,,,,,,,

n13d9f,,investing,post,1619699725,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval ProcessWelcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

2. The capital gains and qualified dividend tax hike won't affect REITs either, because they're already taxed as ordinary income(other than QBI deduction)

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

4. Real estate has historically done well during periods of inflation, and many leading indicators for inflation are present(High commodity prices, shortages, high demand, stimulus, M2 growth, unemployment dropping, rising inflation expectations)

5. REITs have yet to recover as much in share price as much as the equity market. While equities are trading at far higher P/E ratios than they were a year ago, REITs FFO to price ratios are still looking cheap.

6. If you look at 1999 when equities were starting to trade at similar P/E Ratios, REITs went on to perform well during the tech bubble crash up until the real estate bubble several years later.

7. Low interest rates present an opportunity for leveraged investment",,,,,,,,

REITS are riskier, and return less.  theres no point in the last 20 years where REITS had a 3 month window where their annualized vol was below SPX, and their return was above it.  same for 6 months, same for 12 months.  so sure, maybe its possible, but considering that REITs have literally never done this, theres no chance it suddenly will.

Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",['AAPL'],,,,,,,

What is ""ours""? USA?

>I'm not going to post specific, in depth TA or research into any particular stocks

But this is the best and most important part? If you don't want to get into your DD then how about amusing me a bit with these questions:

* How do feel about the risk of weak returns since Brazil has been in a decade of economic down turn? Historically Brazil has had booms that market them look like they'll reach developed status only to bust back into developing status.

* Have you factored in the problems with inflation and continued currency weakness? US might be printing like crazy, but LatAm currencies are experiencing inflation not only against their own goods/services but also against the dollar.

* Are you factoring the various troubles of Bolsonaro government having immediate and long term impacts?

* How are you so sure those individual stocks will do so well? Investing in Brazil is already risky as is with it likely being outside the circle of competence of most people. The added individual stock picks only increases those risks. Why not invest in an ETF like EWZ?

* What makes you think that these Brazilian stocks or even a Brazilian ETF can outperform US stocks when historically speaking the US & S&P has beaten Brazil and the Brazilian top stocks in basically every time range be it 1yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, or 50yr?

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”","['KO', 'SNA', 'DE', 'CE', 'PEP', 'DOV', 'TEL', 'WHR']",,,,,,,

**Here is an advice, if you really want to grasp how persistent is inflation, you want to look at how high are the base effects,  companies can pass through the cost of higher inputs, what's the state of demand what is exactly pushing it and is it structural ? Can supply adapt quickly enough and do they have the capacity to adapt in the first place ?**

* Great studios are very far and few. To develop something like the Witcher series and gain such widespread critical acclaim is not easy. It takes a lot of money, talent, and momentum to be able to build such competence as a developer, that's valuable.
* Essentially CD Projekt Red benefits from being HQ'd in Eastern Europe. These games require an army to develop. Well, eastern developers are a cheap and talented army.
* The games of today are services, they are not one-off products. Cyber Punk will be improved upon, and over time the developers will hash out all the bugs and the game will improve.
* The best time to release a new IP is during the release of a new generation of consoles. It matters less whether the game is any good, the key is to make the IP a thing (one game is not the IP). As far as I am concerned, every gamer has heard of this IP now. All it takes are some critical reviews of the next installments to completely change the media storyline.

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March & September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA & ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

I’ve been holding a couple hundred shares of Alibaba for a little while and last night while I was browsing yahoo finance I noticed that the price target range had been lifted from $220-$350 to $1000-$2500 and almost had a heart attack from the excitement.

n0alci,gw8whb3,investing,comment,1619660842,"I am 33 years old married man with my first baby on the way in July. My wife and I have about 55K in a High Yield Savings Account, however with interest rates going down, the return has been pretty poor. Looking to move some of the money to some higher growth accounts. I also have about 45K in different ETFs and Stocks (Robhinhood & Stash...mostly tech, blue chip stock)

My wife and I both work full time. Combined annual income is around 200K.

We currently own a house and want to grow our money for savings/retirement. There is no plan for a big purchase, maybe a new house in a few years but likely would use the profits from our current house for a down payment. It really would just to be grow the money for retirement.

I don't mind being a risky, my wife is more conservative however. She thinks the $17 we get a month from our savings account is a big win. 

I currently max out my 401K and have about 80K in there right now. (Started a little late maxing it out)

I do not have an IRA . 

Don't have a ton of debt, maybe 1K on a credit card and I lease my car. My wife's car is paid off.

I just opened an E\*trade Core Portfolio account to transfer 15K of that 55K into it to hopefully grow. Should I go this route or are there better options to grow my money? If I invest it in an IRA can I take it out at any time or will I get taxed if I take it out before 59.5? My father passed away at 60 so I'd rather spend my money earlier in life.

mzn9py,,investing,post,1619526251,"What do you think broad market returns will average over the next 20 years?When retirement planning or just choosing between different investment opportunities we all have to make some assumptions about what the long-term broad market outlook is. With a difference of 2% growth rates over the next 20 years there can be massive differences in the end value of your investment.


The historical CAGR (with dividends) of the S&P500 over the last X years (ending Dec 31 2020) is as follows:

100 Years: 10.46%

90: 9.92%

80: 11.23%

70: 11.54%

60: 10.27%

50: 10.76%

40: 12.01%

30: 10.24%

20: 6.59%

10: 13.99%

Source: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm


Knowing this, what do you assume the broad market will have for an annualized growth rate over the next 20 years or so? I'm thinking along the lines of the total S&P500 return, VTSAX, or similar. Why?


I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more. Second, I think macroeconomic headwinds are coming compared to the previous decades that will result in slower overall growth.",['SPGI'],,,,,,,
mzn9py,gw2hafy,investing,comment,1619541843,"For what it's worth, despite many on Reddit saying it would be a wild guess, the idea of forecasting returns within a rough degree of accuracy is pretty well accepted in mainstream finance.  After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

There's a bunch more, obviously, but those are some highlights.  I would encourage anyone who genuinely wants to absorb some information to read the [full report](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/ltcma-full-report.pdf).  It's a bit long, but it's full of fantastic insights.

E: it should be noted that JPM isn't the only institution doing this - most banks release similar reports, even the fan favorite Vanguard has long term market assumptions that largely reflect these, and so did Jack Bogle before his passing.  The reason I mention it is to note that the idea of return forecasting isn't some sort of crazy complex finance marketing - it's just an execution of some basic macroeconomics and math.",['JPM'],,,,,,,

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -> Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -> Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-> Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-> Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook & Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this? 

I don't wanna seem conspiratorial but it'd seem that most institutional investors have a vested interest in holding GE. 

More worryingly, the only coverage about the aftermath I can find, seems to be taken down: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-25/it-s-almost-like-the-shock-ge-short-thesis-never-happened

mz77xi,,investing,post,1619469066,"New guidelines for DD posts**This is a follow up to /u/Greytoc's post here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mw4jei/psa_stock_promotion_and_suspicious_stock/

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.     

Unrelated: We've eased up the automod constraints on advice/beginner posts to hopefully encourage more complex questions to come through.",,,,,,,,

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR'],,,,,,,

From the perspective of somebody that actually holds crypto in a wallet, not one that just speculates on it on robinhood, how would everything you hold and every transaction you ever make be in any way beneficial? Transparent blockchains are good for validation systems, but they are the worst possible thing that can be applied to any form of currency if you want to maintain any level of privacy whatsoever.

Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Aetna common stock is being exchanged for $145.00 in cash and ***0.8378 shares of CVS*** Health common stock.  CVS Health is not issuing any fractional shares in the transaction. Instead, the total number of shares of CVS Health common stock that each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive is being rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive cash for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that the Aetna shareholder is otherwise entitled to receive.

However, I disagree with both. I think you can time both, but it's really about making sure you're not overpaying for assets.

For example, if you look in the stock market you will find some stocks that are still a good value despite the overall market 100% being in a bubble. The same goes for real estate. There are probably some real estate markets that will grow quite well over the next 5-10 years. I'm thinking the states where there is no income tax is a good example of good markets in general.

my953u,,investing,post,1619360105,"Feedback post: we're considering revising/specifying the rules on advice/spitball postsThe moderation pendulum swings all over the place, but I fear it's a bit too far on constricting right now.  We haven't actually changed any of our base rules, but have tightened up on some in the post GME deluge of dumb posts. 

I know /u/greytoc just made a post on DD guidelines, we're just about ready to roll out some new firm guidelines on what DD is appropriate and what is not.  So stay tuned for that.  

So, that said the volume of posts has decreased significantly here, a lot are being removed for very good reasons, but we're still thinking of ways to strike a nice balance (to be clear - quality of discussion is and will continue to be our primary goal with any rule).  I regularly check the automod removal logs and 99% of the posts being removed are frankly just really generic advice requests or basic questions. 

That said, I'd like to formulate some formal guidelines for differentiating between a post that should be in a daily thread and one that can have it's own thread.  I'd like for sufficiently complex topics to be able to generate insightful discussion - this is an inherently subjective threshold so someone's gonna be mad about their post not making the cut, but I think formalizing some guidelines should help.  

So, I was discussing this with /u/Emc87, and our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here.  But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.  

This obviously creates a lot of room for interpretation - I've seen enough people in modmail arguing that ""how do I buy stock"" is a valid discussion topic that would help many people to know that we're not going to make everyone happy here.  But I would like to see what thoughts everyone has as to putting a semi-formal framework on these ideas, so that we can point to something when deciding which posts will be sent to the daily threads and which can have their own post.",['GOOGL'],,,,,,,

mym15t,,investing,post,1619398704,"Tax it now? Or tax it later?I’ve always heard the order of investing for retirement should go as follows:
Contribute to Employer Tax Deferred Plan up to the match amount
Max out Roth IRA
Back to Employer Plan and max it out
Contribute to Taxable accounts

That’s what we’ve been working on for the last three years. My wife has a 403(b) and a Roth IRA. I haven’t had an employee plan, so I’ve just been maxing out my Roth IRA and that’s it. 

I know the assumption people rely on for this plan is that their tax bracket in retirement will be higher than what it is now, hence taking the taxes now in lieu of taking them in retirement. 

I just got a job that offers a SIMPLE IRA (tax deferred account similar to 401(k)) with a 3% employer match. 

Our adjusted gross income last year (married filing jointly) was around 95k.

mym15t,gvxb4h5,investing,comment,1619442134,"The advice you've outlined is pretty common in /r/personalfinance which tends to be skewed to young, early career, or pre-career demographics or people working in a career with limited/stagnated earnings. Roth is a good option for these workers because they tend to be in lower tax brackets now, but with potential for higher income in the future and in retirement. Additionally, Roth IRA's allow removal of contributions (but not growth) without penalty which provides flexibility in how the money is used which younger workers value. 

If you're an older, professional, mid/late career worker, in a career where earnings tend to increase with experience and responsibility, you will tend to get more benefit from pre-tax account contributions. These workers tend to be in higher tax brackets and have income that exceeds their planned retirement income. These workers should prioritize 401k, HSA. Deductible IRA contributions generally are not an option due to the low income cap. 

The rule of thumb I've seen is that if you're in the bottom two tax brackets you should prioritize after-tax accounts (Roth, Roth 401k). If you're above the bottom two tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax (401k, HSA) and after maxing these, use Roth IRA, then taxable accounts.",,,,,,,,

mydjye,gvxq9vn,investing,comment,1619449452,"Look, you are free to disregard this, but I'm hoping to save you a lot of pain.  For what it's worth, I'm currently the CEO of a biotech startup that's raised $30MM.

If you don't meet the accredited investor definition (by wealth, not certification) and you're not playing an active role in managing whatever you're looking at investing in, at least one of the following are true: you should not be investing in that business, and if that business is interested in having you as an investor, *nobody* should be investing in it.

The rules are there to protect investors who can't afford to lose significant amounts of money from high-risk, illiquid investments where there are significant information gaps between investors and management due to the lack of formal reporting.  It's not just that you're risking money that may disappear; it's that you're doing it without the ability to have the market setting the price, analysts reviewing financials, and real due diligence.

Moreover, the rules are there because, to have you as an investor, these companies need you to invest *a lot* *more* than you could lose comfortably if you don't meet the thresholds.  When I raised the seed into my current company, minimum investment was $50k.  I wanted a clean cap table with investors who wouldn't be pinched if it took a long time to get out (on average, that's 5-10 YEARS) and who knew what they were signing up for.  A company who is ok with someone investing $5k-$10k that isn't a founder and is marginally accredited either a) isn't raising enough money to scale; b) is going to have a very messy cap table; or c) is delusional or lying about capital needs or business potential.  Likely all three.

If you want to get involved with exciting startup investments, go be a part of an exciting startup.  Start one yourself, or find some founders and offer to help, or just get a job at a startup.  But if you're not accredited, you shouldn't be investing in these things -- the potential for loss is massive and you're not going to have enough firepower or financial ballast to make much of a difference or weather the rough times.",,,,,,,,

mxaojd,,investing,post,1619230712,"The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail InvestorEDIT: I added the [MacroVoices podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDIifbY71g) where Chris Cole goes over the Dragon Portfolio. I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&P 500. This tends to outperform the S&P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.","['LEG', 'SPGI']",,,,,,,

mwvqvk,,investing,post,1619185962,"Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunityLeave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",,,,,,,,

mwo3ha,,investing,post,1619155271,"Some advice from a regular dude that will hopefully make you more money...Are you making stock purchases based on opinions from analysts, CNBC, stock pickers, and everything in between?

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to [instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664513-alteryx-shares-drop-after-chief-revenue-officer-resigns).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, [an analyst](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/alteryx-s-1-breakdown-4a711683f6c) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares.","['NDAQ', 'MMM']",,,,,,,

Alteryx were not particularly happy when they found out but this wasn't technically against their T&Cs. 

Alteryx desktop was fun to play with and tableau integrations etc are useful but it's just not practically scalable for any ML imo.

1. Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power BI can easily do all the of the same data transformation/modeling/blending/reporting without buying any licenses. It can't mimic Alteryx's data science packages but does any professional actually use those instead of python/R?
2. Alteryx has much friendlier UI/UX but the MS Office team has been doing an incredible job with Office 365 making it super user friendly and powerful. I could easily see them creating a slick O365 product for codeless data blending and analytics. Or just tie Power Apps, Flow, and Data Factory together into a single, simple UX. 
3. Adding an Alteryx copycat to the O365 family with out-of-the-box connectivity to all the other O365 services seems like a huge perk. Seamless integration between Excel, One Drive, Power BI, and Active Directory sounds super nice to me.

Anecdotally, I'm Alteryx Core certified and fluent in M and python. A lot of times for data transformation I'll go with power query just because the native Excel integration makes it quick and easy. For more advanced jobs I'll go to python for the flexibility. The only standout thing about Alteryx to me is its user friendliness which I think Microsoft is more than capable of matching at some point.","['MS', 'MSFT']",,,,,,,

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive. 

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price. 

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of  growth figures is required to get great returns.",['GOOGL'],,,,,,,

mx7aye,,investing,post,1619218741,"Ideas for investing in growth in the sunbeltThe southern US is growing much faster than the rest of the US, especially places like the Phoenix MSA and Texas Triangle. Of the top 10 most populous cities in the US, the only four that have experienced more than 10% population growth in the past decade have been in Texas and Arizona. Austin in particular (#11th most populous US city) grew 24% in the past decade and is probably the hottest real estate market in the US right now. Anyone who lives in these areas, especially Texas, knows how how many people from places like California are going to Texas for cheaper CoL amongst other things. I'd provide links but I'm not sure if they'd get my post deleted by AutoMod - city/state growth is readily available.

That being said, real estate is the most obvious investment opportunity to profit off of this demographic shift. My only exposure to real estate as a 25 year old just starting my career is FundRise and REITs - FundRise has a clear focus on southern real estate, especially in TX, and with enough research you can find REITs (like MAA, CPT, BRT) that invest primarily in the sunbelt region.

Other ideas I've had are power/utilities companies like PNW. One might even combine this demographic perspective with climate change speculation - people are moving to hot places that are going to keep getting hotter; air conditioning stocks like CARR may be a good choice?

So form my perspective, I can only really think REITs/utilities/AC. I wanted to give my own two cents on how to profit off of this growth but also see if people here had other ideas as to specific sectors or stocks (or non-stock market ideas) and spark discussion. I'm also curious if people here have ideas for investing in other demographic trends such as aging population.","['MAA', 'CARR', 'PNW']",,,,,,,

mwx0rd,,investing,post,1619189538,"Enbridge: Critical Infrastructure in the Green RevolutionThe green revolution is upon us. Enbridge is a critical energy infrastructure business known for transporting oil and natural gas. It also has a sizeable renewable segment. What you might not be aware of is how well that stacks up in the renewables space and how such companies are including non-renewable power in their total outputs.

For capacity context, the International Renewable Energy Agency released its [2020 Renewable Capacity Statistics ](https://www.irena.org/publications/2021/March/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2021)which provides insights into the sector as a whole.

 I have ranked Enbridge with various renewable companies in terms of **current net capacity** (the maximum output of electricity a generator can produce under ideal conditions) **minus natural gas capacity,** which[ according to the International Renewable Energy Agency is an alternative fossil fuel. ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Apr/IRENA_Report_GET_2018.pdf)Definitions for what constitute *renewable* natural gas vary and you will see further examples below, but this number is included where available. The only outputs considered are strictly renewable: solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. I have not included energy generation statistics (how much energy is actually output) because this varies based on operating capacity and conditions (eg. weather events will lower output).  


All data has been sourced from the latest publicly available ESG or Annual Reports and provided below. 

 

|**Company**|**Net Renewable Capacity (MW)**|
|:-|:-|
|Brookfield Renewable|18,884|
|Innergex Renewable|2,742|
|Boralex|2,455|
|Enbridge|1,727|
|Algonquin|1,456|
|Northland Power|1,323|
|Transalta Renewables|1,619\*\*|

\*\* \*\*Transalta Renewables as at Dec 31 2020 listed only gross renewable MW and not net, which is significantly lower. 

&#x200B;

 **Brookfield Renewable:** by far the largest output capacity and zero natural gas facilities. The majority of net capacity comes from Hydro and Wind. 

 **Innergex Renewable:** The majority of net capacity comes from Wind and Hydro. Again no natural gas. 

 **Boralex:** 82% of net capacity is derived from Wind. Least diversified of the group. 

 **Enbridge:** Majority of renewable capacity generated by Wind. Renewables represent 3% of EBITDA and appx. $200MM in annual contracted revenues. 

 Combined Current Renewable Power Generation outputs:  
• 1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;  
• 255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;  
• 80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation 

 **Algonquin**: The latest data from 2021 sources showed FY19 figures. You will see coal listed here: the Asbury coal plant was closed in March 2020. Furthermore, a significant portion of their capacity is from natural gas (50%), which is from non-renewable sources and thus not included. 

 **Northland Power:** Included in their total output is ‘efficient’ natural gas, which accounts for \~60% of net capacity. While the outcome is reduced emissions, it is still not a renewable source and therefore not included in total renewable capacity. 

 **Transalta Renewables:** Similar to Algonquin and Northland, a significant portion of capacity is from natural gas (\~60%). I was unable to find updated net capacity statistics, which are significantly lower than gross, thus TA ranked last. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net capacity is an important metric in measuring where a renewable company stands, but it is not the only one. Revenues are impacted by total output and pricing, of which the weather events in Texas provided an eye-opening example. Nevertheless, what we see from the above comparison is that Enbridge is already well positioned amongst common North American “renewable” names, albeit far behind big players like Brookfield. Looking through the above company ESG and Annual Reports highlighted further forays into traditional renewable sources, while also noting investments in **renewable natural gas**. Let’s not forget the critical role Enbridge will play in RNG transmission alongside their [own RNG production.](https://www.enbridgegas.com/Natural-Gas-and-the-Environment/Enbridge-A-Green-Future/Renewable-Natural-Gas) 

 Make of this information what you will. The market is currently discounting their business with the secular oil decline, and not fully considering Enbridge’s ability to innovate and partner alongside a growing global energy infrastructure network, particularly in the NG/RNG space. I am bullish.

I have been using their product Omnipod for the past decade or so. As far as I'm aware, it is the only insulin pump that is wireless. At this current moment, there are other insulin pumps include additional features like integration with continuous glucose monitors, Omnipod has partnered with Tidepool, a nonprofit that has created an automated insulin dosing application (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005324/en/Tidepool-Completes-FDA-510-k-Submission-of-Tidepool-Loop).

This is a HUGE deal for type 1 diabetics (apart from Tandem's t:slim X2 which currently has a feature BasalIQ but this has tubing so not wireless (https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/providers/products/basal-iq)). Having your insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor communicate and automatically adjust is heading towards the direction of creating an 'artificial pancreas' and makes managing diabetes so much better. I think that having the 'wireless' feature will put them at an advantage when an eventual 'combination' insulin pump/continuous glucose monitor hits the market.",,,,,,,,

The major development on the e horizon is fda approval for a version of their pump that will be supported through TidePool Loop. TidePool loop is going to be an open source FDA approved automated closed loop insulin delivery system. Closed loop? That means the pump system is paired with a continuous blood glucose monitor which provides real time blood sugar read outs and real time insulin delivery. 

This is a big deal as the current Loop system is skunkworks project which works great but is not mainstream. 

Tl;dr.  Omnipod is on the cusp of being part of a truly FDA approved artificial pancreas system and their tech is the only one that is entirely wireless (no tubes). 

I can’t comment if it’s worth their current pricing but it’s definitely a big deal.",,,,,,,,
mw4jei,,investing,post,1619097477,"PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendationsFor those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

If you are new to reddit r/investing \- and you wish to post dd please see the wiki guidelines for appropriate dd here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules)

> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


>He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said.","['TWTR', 'GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'FB']",,,,,,,

n3ulj5,,StockMarket,post,1620044501,"$KOPN DD: imo, the REAL AR/VR winner (e.g. vs. $MVIS)**Unknown AR/VR**

Everyone knows that companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook are turning to AR/VR. For instance, we have the Microsoft/MVIS “relationship”, Apple [smart glasses](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-glasses) coming, Google glasses having already been out, and Zuck spending **much** of his $5B R&D on AR/VR. As the sector grows, these mega-companies can either develop their own tech—and many will, in part—or acquire / partner with smaller players. Many will do that too. So the question is: which of these smaller companies do you believe in?

**MVIS Craze**

Many of you have recently been burnt by MVIS. It certainly had an appealing storyline, full of speculation, intrigue, and the promise of a trip to the moon. Maybe things will turn around. But all I know is that **I’m** putting my money elsewhere. After the events of this past week, and after reading this, I wonder if you’ll decide to join me...

Because Kopin, $KOPN, is fucking underloved here. Why? Well, I think it’s mostly because it’s simply not as well known. But here’s the thing: stocks tend to be unknown until they’re not. And, ideally, you want to buy in before that large scale recognition occurs. See below for an illustration of this very point:

https://preview.redd.it/7qmncpk8eww61.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0f849a53aef7e6a42859ad0178ba757f703f51

So what *is* Kopin? [Taken from another DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgdk0p/kopn_and_why_i_believe_it_has_100_upside_potential/):

**“KOPN (Kopin Corporation)** is best known for its display devices for mobile electronics. The company was founded by engineers from MIT and currently holds hundreds of patents that are applicable to \[Virtual and\] Augmented Reality. Some of the most promising patents involve wearable technology and voice recognition-based headsets.

In the past several years, Kopin has contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense to research wearable head-mounted computers for soldiers. They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin's growth potential.”

Essentially, Kopin competes in the same space as MVIS and VUZI. But they’re not exactly playing the same game.

**Tech**

First, KOPN’s tech and patents mentioned here are highly promising. I’ll talk a bit more about them, but feel free to check out this cool series of webinars [yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5E4WsPVOYY&feature=youtu.be). Another thing to do is read the linked article; Kopin recently shipped its first batch of OLED [microdisplays](https://www.oled-info.com/kopin-developeds-double-stack-oled-architecture-higher-brightness-oled). They have their own double-stack architecture which enhances battery life and image fidelity—two components that will be key for things like consumer electronics. I believe they will win in this space.

They also have a chip for voice activation called [Whisper](https://www.kopin.com/audio-solutions/), which they’ve filed over 20 patents for. They claim that “Whisper maintained an accuracy rate of 93 percent in a 95 dB noise environment, compared to competitive products, which maintained an accuracy rate of just 40 percent or less.” Given how people will want to use their smart glasses hands-free, this will be key. And based on the above quote, they will win here too.

Finally, it’s worth mentioning the company’s military connections. Many don’t realize this, but Kopin is the [largest](https://www.kopin.com/military-applications/) supplier of microdisplays for the U.S. military. Think things like thermal weapon sights, night vision goggles and pilot helmet mounted displays for F-35 fighter jets. This is quite a testimonial in my opinion; the military doesn’t play when it comes to technology…

All of this tech is protected via over 200 wearables-related patents, and 20 patents related to OLED. Their tech advantage is also reflected by their blue-chip customer base, which really speaks for itself:

https://preview.redd.it/x3eahi0aeww61.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=04aca0376fa0226a2db864ef9cd8b30895763dee

I’d encourage any technical people to delve more into Kopin and their customers to really understand the power of their patents and product offering. Maybe leave a comment below!

**Financials**

For every bet, including “informed bets” like the stock market, there are two key components: the cost of the ticket and the payout potential. What I like about $KOPN is that you are paying *hugely* “less” to bet on the future of AR/VR (at least relative to competitors). Essentially, $KOPN is in a highly appealing financial position, with the potential for “hype”—which hasn’t really moved the stock as drastically—serving as a nice call option on the stock. First, check out the Kopin quarterly income statement:

https://preview.redd.it/lgodi0yaeww61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=478c34aa29ca6398ffce3570102f6e606108c81f

A few trends stick out. First, the company is steadily growing revenues, while maintaining a reasonable GPM. They are also increasing R&D spend, which is important for a company in a burgeoning and highly technological sector. But really, the most exciting trend is that of Operating Income margin, which has gone from negative to positive, along with EPS!

The company also posted $34.9 million in LTM revenue as of the last quarter. Compare this to MVIS, with $3 million over the same time frame. Now, it’s quite clear that this company presents *at least* an equally attractive financial situation as MVIS, by any standard definition.

Further, if this trajectory continues and other things hold, the company would continue to post positive EPS—which is something that competitors like VUZI or MVIS simply cannot claim. After the last earnings report, where Kopin flipped EPS positive, the stock reacted extremely well, shooting up over 20%. What will happen if they improve even further?

The company is also not likely, in my opinion, to undertake any significant dilutive actions, or to go bankrupt. This is because they have an attractive balance sheet with **no debt**. So let’s put it like this: you are getting positive EPS, with a good balance sheet, at an $875 million market cap. Compare this to MVIS at a $3.3 billion market cap, with negative EPS, or VUZI at a $1.5 billion market cap—and also with negative EPS! In my view, you “pay” much less to bet on AR/VR with KOPN.

So what do you *get* if you’re “paying less?”

**Catalysts**

First, you get access to a market growing at a rather nice CAGR. Since Kopin will be a major player in this market, you can simply check this estimation from the KOPN corporate presentation. Assuming KOPIN gets a mere 1% of this spend, they will be shockingly undervalued here.

https://preview.redd.it/dey6u3kieww61.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=add762fbaf92cf4bb5cd9cf01fffa23f2ee1f43d

But perhaps more excitingly, you get access to a near-term series of catalysts which could see the share price appreciate significantly. Here’s a potential timeline, which doesn’t include the potential for surprise events:

* **May 4th Earnings Call**
* May 12 Webinar II - Present AR / VR
* May 26 Webinar III - Future AR / VR
* June 6-7 Stifel Tech Conference
* June 7-9 Apple WorldWide Developers Conference

This presents numerous “shots on goal” for $KOPN.

Of course, ultimately the company’s fate depends on performance, because the ticker has traded largely without hype, at least when compared to MVIS or VUZI. Consider the following comparison of the three companies to get an idea how little followed and undervalued KOPN is. First, the MVIS financial “highlights”:

https://preview.redd.it/ll5yanrceww61.png?width=2210&format=png&auto=webp&s=1332365538f72d4032f63ad5cc06112d577b89aa

Now, VUZI:

https://preview.redd.it/o7qop3hdeww61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7c45622355639fe57d46c131c39c4b45539b12

A bit better than MVIS, but still…

And, finally, KOPN:

https://preview.redd.it/6c9f78ceeww61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=00bea97b3e6438e79fcfecfc4529168df40f4bc3

Now, I’m sure I’ll have a million of you reeeing out, telling me how I just don’t understand the tech, and tHat MVIS wIlL gO tO tHe mOOn. That’s fine. I’m not here to convince anyone. All I’m doing is suggesting that you, rubbing together your two brain cells, **look through the above and play spot the trend.** Then ask yourself: as this market grows, which of these companies do you believe in?

Personally, I believe in the recently newly profitable technology leader partnered with Lockheed Martin, FLIR, and Google.

**TL;DR:**

**Long $KOPN.**

 The above graphs show how retail traders love to discuss only high-volatility stocks. The average Beta value across the top 10 most discussed stocks last month was 3.14! 

In case you are not well versed with Beta, the following is its explanation from Investopedia.

>Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. By definition, the market, such as the S&P 500 Index, has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the market.

This was one of the most requested information in my posts. Above are the returns you would have got if you invested in the trending stocks last month. 5/9 stocks (ignoring SPY) gave a positive return last month but only 2 of them beat SPY. This is important considering the amount of risk (beta shown above) you are taking with the individual stock. The returns are benchmarked using March 31st closing price and April 30th closing price.

\*Note\* I posted this a few days ago on WSB. Mods deleted it (probably not enough rocket emojis), so I figured this might be a more suitable place for discussion!. Cheers!

With the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain, and recent events such as the Suez Canal blockage, as well as the Semiconductor Shortage, there has never been a stronger demand for Supply Chain efficiency. President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US’’ need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.

**COMPANY SUMMARY**

*“Leaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.” \~ Tom Peters*

Essentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).

ETWO has only recently went public on February 21’, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it’s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it’s fundamentals and it’s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).

The stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it’s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it’s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it’s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it’s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis.

One of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow. In $ETWO's case, this comes from it's subscription sales, which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times . This is another strength that $ETWO possesses, as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate - which is a an indicator of a massive moat, which can allow $ETWO to retain profits from its competitors. This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO:

* Strong Performance on Key Metrics:

**What Wallstreet is Saying**

*“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” \~ Warren Buffett,*

Although it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:

*""E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.""*

**One Final and Intriguing Note:**

A few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it’s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).

I am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.

**TL;DR:**

The cheaply valued ETWO and it’s value proposition, it’s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it’s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.

n3yp4i,,StockMarket,post,1620055123,"You liked RICK (700% return), strip club consumer cyclical play. Now check out BDL, a similarly undervalued restaurant stock primed for a big move.  

Alright Reddit crowd, WSBers, penny-stock-ers. I’m setting you up for an amazing, under the radar, value play in the consumer cyclical space. RICK, the strip club owner, is one of the best performing stocks of the past year, with 700% returns and a lot of value hedge fund back-patting on that one. But they have pumped the price on that one already, and the best of that play is gone. But I have found an even better one, which is pretty much at the same stage where RICK was a year ago. This baby is primed for a huge re-rating and the small float can get it running quickly. Strap in fellow retards, we’re going to FLANIGANS.

Flanigans Enterprises (BDL) owns and operates restaurants and liquor stores in South Florida. With over 30 locations, the stores are incredibly popular and well run. They have managed the pandemic incredibly well, and successfully pivoted to an strong online ordering model which has rolled out successfully. This is a very under the radar stock, but the fundamentals are incredibly solid and once more people, and followers of RICK, catch on, it should jump big time. I have a background in value investing, and this one checks all the boxes for an undervalued small cap stock with very little downside based on its current operating returns. See below for a comparison on key metrics between BDL, RICK, and the consumer discretionary sector as a whole. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jomt44x1axw61.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29b4e61c7714e043a273285da854498c16061a1

As you can see, at minimum BDL has positive net income compared to RICK’s negative, and the same amount of yearly revenue with a market cap 1/15th the size. It has the same amount of debt and is significantly less volatile to RICK and the consumer discretionary sector as a whole. The company generates significant free cash flow and is trading at highly attractive multiples, including at almost 1:1 to book value (the company has a strong portfolio of real estate as well). 

The company also has high insider ownership, a sign of strong belief in the company by management. Significant shares are also owned by Jim Simons Renaissance Technologies, UBS, Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and other value-oriented hedge funds. 

Pandemic aside, they have been growing their net income and free cash flow at a steady clip, and have successfully reinvested the FCF at high returns. The companies ROIC (return on invested capital, a key value investing metric), averages over 10%. 

The stock has been consolidating for a while, hitting a double top at $26. Once it breaks through, it should be clear to 40+ as a price target.

All in all, when you look across the restaurant sector in light of the upcoming reopening, Flanigan’s is ready to capitalize on a significant re-rating using their efficient capital management.

TLDR: BDL is in the same place RICK was a year ago, prior to running 700%

n3vf1z,,StockMarket,post,1620046844,"The Short Iron Condor Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m continuing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. If you will find this helpful, I will appreciate any sort of feedback. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Short Iron Condor.

A Short Iron Condor is a neutral option strategy that allows traders to profit from an underlying that trades flat or range bound. Other ways to profit from a short iron condor is through a decrease in [Implied volatility](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=1005 ) and the passage of time (theta)

A short iron condor consists of buying 2 options and selling 2 options all of the same expiration date, which thus comprises 4 options in this strategy in total. It is simply a combination of a Bull Put Spread and a Bear Call Spread. (For now you can skip what this means but if you would like to learn the basics of vertical spreads that make up for such strategies such as this one, click [here](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=371))

Take a look at this example.

Stock FFF is trading at $60, a trader speculates that the stock will continue to trade flat with little movements for the foreseeable future. The Trader forms a speculative assumption that the stock could potentially stay between 55 to 65 in the next 2 weeks. Therefore, the trader sets up a bull put spread with the short strike being at 55 and a bear call spread with its short strike being at 65 with the long strikes being 5 points away from each of the short strikes. Since neither of the 4 options are set up with any intrinsic value, these spreads are considered OTM.
 
* March 2/21 Long 50 Put- $1.20
* March 2/21 Short 55 Put- $2.10
* March 2/21 Short 65 call- $2.30
* March 2/21 Long 70 call- $1.30

This comes out to a total net credit of 1.9/$190. Net credit is simply the difference in what you receive from selling the short options minus the premium paid for buying the long options in the strategy. Alternatively, you can look at it as the sum of the net credit of the bull put spread and the bear call spread. Either way, you get the same total net credit. (2.30+2.10) – (1.20 +1.30)= 1.90. This net credit is = max profit, the maximum amount you stand to make from this trade. 

**Max Profit** 

The max profit is realized when the stock trades in between the short put and the short call at expiration. In this case if the stock trades at $63 at expiration which is between 55-65, both the Bull Put Spread and the Bear call spread expires worthless and max profit is attained.

**Max loss**

The max loss is equivalent to the width of the strikes – the net credit received. Since the width of the strikes in this example = $5, and the net credit of the iron condor =$1.90, the max loss of this trade is 5-1.90= $3.10. Max loss is realized when the stock trades above the long call or below the long put at expiration. Hence, if the stock trades at 70 and above or 50 and below at expiration, max loss will be attained. This is because as the stock moves out of the profitable range, the stock can only breakout from 1 side and hence a trader only loses on 1 spread of the iron condor and gains on the other (either bull put or bear call spread). 

To explain this further, If the stock breaks out to the upside and trades at 75 at expiration, you will take the max loss on the bear call spread (width – net credit of the bear call spread). However the bull put spread will be at its max profit zone and expire worthless resulting in a profit of its net credit. Thus, if you take the max loss of the bear call spread – the max profit of the bull put spread, it would derive the same result from taking the width of the iron condor – total net credit. However if the iron condor is set up with different widths apart on the bear call and bull put spreads, the max loss will be equal to the larger width of both spreads minus the total net credit

**Breakeven**

An iron condor has 2 breakeven points one towards the downside and the other towards the upside. The downside breakeven= short put- total net credit. The upside breakeven= short call + total net credit. Using these calculations In the example shown above the breakeven points are 53.1 and 66.9. This means that if the stock drops and is at 53.1 at expiration, you will breakeven on this trade. Same can be said for the upside where if the stock rises and is at 66.9 at expiration, you will also breakeven.

**Profit zone:(not the same as max profit)**

With the breakeven points established, the profitable upside zone will between the short call strike and the breakeven point of the upside. In this example, the upside profit zone = 65.01-66.89.  The downside profitable zone will be between the short put strike and the breakeven point of the downside. The downside profit zone in this example will be = 54.99- 53.11.

**Loss zone:(not the same as max loss)**

the upside loss zone will be between the upside breakeven point and the long call. The upside loss zone in this example = 66.91-69.99. The downside loss zone will be between the downside breakeven point and the long put. The downside loss zone in this example= 53.09-50.01.

**The highlights of this analysis are as follows:**

* The management has changed the business model of GoPro into a more DTC business. 
* GoPro's subscription side of their business had 55% QoQ and 145% YoY growth rates.
* GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model.
* The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly (consumer electronics, photographic equipment, and action camera's)
* GoPro's main competition is DJI, Akaso, and Garmin (especially in the action camera market)

**Investment Plan:**

* Buy between $10-14 and hold long-term (until it reaches fair value)
* Sell if the stock falls below $10.49
* Look for re-entry at $8.80-$9.20 (if stock falls below $10.49 and you sell)

**Stocks Fair Value:**

Using a DCF (as seen in the analysis below), GoPro has an estimated share value of $39.12, this implies a potential upside of 248.35%. 

If you  follow my advice above there is only a 6.59% downside risk before selling and re-entry, this makes the risk-to-reward of my trading strategy very favourable.

# Analysis

**Company Overview:**

GoPro manufactures and sells cameras, drones, and other filming/photography accessories. Their main products consist of the HERO7, HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras, and a MAX 360-degree waterproof camera. The HERO 9 camera is the best-selling camera in the US digital market. GoPro also offers cloud-based storage solutions that enables customers to access, edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro’s cameras. GoPro also offers camera protection plans (GoPro Care) and video editing applications (Quik).

GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors/distributors, as well as through their own e-commerce store. GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014, and since its IPO has fallen by over 31%.

GoPro has a TTM revenue of $891.9M, a TTM EBITDA of -$22.6M and a market cap of 1.719B. Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N/A, putting a value on this company is difficult.

Recently, GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this. GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer (DTC) approach in their business model, this has led them to scale back on spending, sales and marketing expenditures, and office space. Furthermore, the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition. This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future.

Investment Information:

**Company and Financial Information:**

GoPro has 3.2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms. This exposure can be leveraged to market their products, and gain product awareness at a significant discount. Furthermore, they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made.

GoPro’s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52% QoQ, and 145% YOY. This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company.

GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021, these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model, increase the DTC component of their business, and grow their gross margins from 36% to 38-40%.

GoPro has 771,000 subscribers to their subscription service, charging an annual fee of $49.99. This amounts to their subscription service bringing in $38.54M last year.

Furthermore, GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package.

GoPro’s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be $68M at FYE 2020. This results in a 24.57x EBITDA multiple, this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report.

**Industry Information:**

GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market, which is valued at $1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7% between 2020-2026. By 2026 (incorporating current industry trends) the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at $1.5T, with 70% of the market being from audio and visual segments, both of which are segments of GoPro’s business.

Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at $22B and is expected to grow at a 5.78% CAGR for the next 6 years. This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Samsung, however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly, giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry.

Lastly, GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3.5B and is expected to grow at a 14% CAGR until 2026. By this time, the industry is expected to be valued at $5.5B.

By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within, we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to determine the fair value share price.

**Competition:**

DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras. Recently, they have launched their very first action camera, the Osmo Action, which is supposed to compete with GoPro’s HERO7. The Osmo Action has a front-facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7.

Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures. Recently, they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro. The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro, however it comes in at a cheaper price point, and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro.

Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation, automotive, marine, outdoor and sport activities. Garmin’s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera, is similar to many GoPro models, shooting video in up to 4K, with similar size and weight to that of GoPro. The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and altimeter, which may be attractive for some consumers.

**Investment Plan and Valuation:**

Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA, we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company. Instead, we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share.

Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of $39.12. The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on, and if GoPro’s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries.

With that being said, the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience. By looking at their current management and their backgrounds, it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years, and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience. This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro, I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future.

For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro. If you can buy the shares in the $10-14 range, you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return. If you buy at current prices $11.23, I recommend holding unless the stock falls below $10.49, if this happened, I would sell and look for a re-entry at $8.80-9.20, then hold long term.

$AEHL - High risk / high reward play. This support is very strong and if we can break the resistance trendline - we may have a massive winner

&#x200B;

$ETH  - Amazing channel up, and strong support right below this trend. I just called it 2 weeks ago, can we do it again?

&#x200B;

$KLAC - We are coming down right to value. Anywhere near $310 is a great deal and right in the pocket of convergence, I love it.

&#x200B;

$NMIH - SHORT! I called it 2 weeks ago to run, it did - now let's ride it down. YOU MUST use a limit buy above incase it rises FOR SURE.

&#x200B;

$NOVA - Amazing triangle is forming, but I want it under $35 for value. Long term makes a bunch of sense, this is a great looking setup.

&#x200B;

$ON   - Amazing value right here, right in trend, near support and 200EMA? That is a beautiful setup for sure.

&#x200B;

$UNM  - Need a lower price, but this is entering right to our area of value. I need to also watch earnings - but this could have a huge runup.","['UNM', 'KLAC']",,,,,,,

We the people. Well more like we the 1%ers. And corporations.

So unless you're a high earner, this won't affect you (much). I made these charts about a week or two ago but I heard for the American Families Plan, individuals earning more than $452,700 and married couples earning more than $509,300 (meaning each partners could earn less than $400,000) could see a tax increase.

**What do you mean, ""won't affect you (much)""?**

If there's tax increases for the rich, what will the rich do? They'll take their stock market gains before the tax increases. 2020 saw huge gains so we may see a correction in the coming months. How much of a correction you ask? I don't know but I would guess 10-15% in the broader market. More if you're into speculative high growth stocks. I say that because I know a lot of you have positions on them. Careful how you invest these next few months.

And if there's tax increases for corporations, obviously they'll do whatever they can to avoid them. However even a 1% increase in their taxes (note below I mention that many corporations pay very little taxes because of loopholes) will affect their bottom line. This means earnings will be less and therefore lower stock valuations.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/65swnd332rw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=228f04d002b432308b558a4583878367e49a559b

**So if the rich sell and corporations are being taxed more, how will that affect the stock market?**

1. Less incentive to invest due to more taxes. People will look to other investments or stay cash. (Seriously though, the tax plan won't make a huge difference unless you're a 1%er.)
2. Bonds become more [favorable](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/government-bonds#:~:text=Income%20from%20bonds%20issued%20by%20state%2C%20city%2C%20and%20local%20governments,where%20the%20bond%20was%20issued). Income from bonds issued by state, city, and local governments (municipal bonds, or munis) is generally free from federal taxes. You will, however, have to report this income when filing your taxes. Examples: MUB, HYD, VOHIX, VWAHX.
3. ETFs and Mutual funds are more favorable. They both are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your earnings. ETFs, however, have an advantage over mutual funds due to three reasons: 1) 2018, 89% of ETFs were passive vs. 4% of mutual funds. Less trading involved with passive. 2) Any high dividend or high interest paying securities will receive more distributions, therefore a high tax bill. 3) ETFs have greater liquidity as they are traded during market hours vs. mutual funds are traded at the beginning and end of market sessions.  
\*In 2018, Goldman Sachs did a study that showed 100% of their ETFs did not pay capital gains. Broadly, 90% of ETFs did not pay capital gains compared to 39% of mutual funds.
4. 4. Tax advantaged accounts like Roth IRA and 401K are more favorable. If you're one of the super rich, take a look at the [backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp). It's a way for super rich people to put money into retirement without the contribution limits. Roth IRA contribution limit is $6,000 per year. BUT if you make more than $140,000 as a single or $206,000 filing jointly as married then you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. The easiest way to get by this is converting a traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account.

&#x200B;

**What does history** [**say**](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/tax-hikes-history#:~:text=In%20the%2013%20previous%20instances,the%20data%20in%20the%20calendar) **about stock market performance after tax increases?**

""In the 13 previous instances of tax increases just since 1950, the S&P 500, the stock index that tracks most of the major companies in the US, has shown higher average returns, and higher odds of an advance, in times when taxes are increasing, according to Chisholm's research, which analyzed the data in the calendar year of the tax changes, plus the year prior and year after. This pattern holds true even when you drill down into key sectors of the S&P 500."" Here's a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2MaBjOp.png) of the S&P500 performance after tax increases. Not too bad eh?

&#x200B;

**What's happening now with the current tax law?**

* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes. Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM are some of those companies. Corporate tax rate is currently 21%.
* 56 Fortune 500 companies paid 0-5% on their 2018 income.
* 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. I couldn't find any data on this but its due to loopholes in the tax system.

**The Made in America Tax plan**

* Will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis.
* Increase corporate tax rate at 28% from 21%
* Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate.
* The proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries.
* The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations.
* Invert the current law in which U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States.
* A proposal that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. Instead a tax credit will be proposed to support onshoring jobs.
* Invert a Trump tax law for “Foreign Derived Intangible Income” (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&D. Instead the revenue will be used to expand more effective R&D investment incentives.
* Enact a minimum tax of 15% on large corporations’ book income.
* Eliminate tax preferences (worth billions of dollars) for fossil fuels and make sure polluting industries pay for environmental clean up.
* Increase enforcement for tax evasion. Typical workers’ wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent.

&#x200B;

**So what should I do to prepare if this bill passes?**

Nothing different honestly. Keep investing. DCA - dollar cost average if your stocks drop. Stay the course in your high conviction names. De-risk if you have to by investing in safer investments like index funds or ETFs. I know a lot of you are into SPAX (special purpose acquisition companies. I spelled it this way in case this sub banned the real acronym) and other speculative companies. There's almost 500 of them out there. 217 of those were from 2020. To be honest, 1% of those companies will moon. Most of them won't see a return for years. Are you willing to hold them without knowing they will moon in 5-10 years? Some may not even make a return. Make sure you understand market conditions. Stocks really do go up but its only the ones that are backed by strong earnings and potential. Don't get burned. Money is not everything but it's a tool to bring you financial freedom sooner in life.

n3bweh,,StockMarket,post,1619978148,"Investing Philosophy V (Fundamental vs Technical Analysis: which works better? Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?) - 5/2/2021 

Hello investors,

It's been a while since I last posted a memo and I am still going through a busy transition with the work. I hope everyone is staying safe and riding the markets to the top.

**1) Fundamental vs Technical Analysis**

I wanted to discuss a topic that should probably have been addressed earlier. I didn't realize until recently that many of the folks that are just getting started in trading tend to lean more towards the ""technical"" analysis of investing and I believe it is critical to understand what the difference is between a technical and fundamental analysis.

**Quick answer to the question of which works better, there is no better or worse. It's a combination of the two that makes an analysis more comprehensive, based on a** **Mosaic Theory****.**

Just for the sake of formality, here are the quick definitions of each.

**Technical analysis:** Technical analysis is concerned with price action, which gives clues as to the stock’s supply and demand dynamics – which is what ultimately determines the stock price. Patterns often repeat themselves because investors often behave in the same way in the same situation. Technical analysis is concerned with price and volume data alone.

**Fundamental analysis**: Fundamental analysis considers the value of the company. This ultimately depends on the value of its assets and the profits it can generate. Fundamental analysts are concerned with the difference between a stock’s value, and the price at which it is trading.

Many people tend to look at the charts and patterns of stock price movements and make quick decisions based purely on the technicals, such as breaking out of a resistance level, forming a consolidation, gapping, ascending vs descending triangles, moving averages, and so on.

I think what many fail to understand is that these trading strategies are highly specialized, meaning that there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to benefit from this type of analysis and most of them fail to achieve consistent returns.

And these are industry veterans with years of experience and the resources with computing power to recognize patterns and being able to execute on the trade ideas in a millionth of a second.

It's not to say that you can't profit consistently from these strategies. I'm saying you cannot simply rely on ""this stock price just broke the 200-D moving average and has a potential to move exponentially higher"" type of analysis.

There is a concept called **""efficient market hypothesis"" (""EMH"")**, which basically states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible.

Now, I have previously mentioned that it is possible to generate alpha in this memo.

What I didn't mention is different levels of EMH.

**Weak efficiency: This type of EMH claims that all past prices of a stock are reflected in today's stock price. Therefore, technical analysis cannot be used to predict and beat the market.**

**Semi-strong efficiency: This form of EMH implies all public (but not non-public) information is calculated into a stock's current share price. Neither fundamental nor technical analysis can be used to achieve superior gains.**

**The point of today's memo is that I believe the market tends to fluctuate between weak and semi-strong efficiency levels of EMH, meaning a combination of fundamental and technical analysis can lead to excess returns and I personally tend to put a heavier weight into the fundamental analysis.**

From a personal standpoint, technical analysis is almost a 50/50 chance game for an average trader. A person who monitors charts at home during the day out of his/her 4 monitors will almost never generate consistent profits over 10-20 year period.

Don't get me wrong. It is possible to generate alpha for that person.

All I'm saying is of the 1,000 hours he spent monitoring and trading on those securities, only 10 hours of research actually resulted in any profitable ideas and he just racked up tens of thousands of dollars in trading fees, **just to increase his winning odds from 51% of all trades to 52%.**

It's not really an efficient way to use your time and energy if you ask me.

After all, technical trading yields very thin odds of success, anywhere from 51% to 53% winning probability on any single trade. That's why professional investors diversify their strategies across hundreds of different trades in a single hour using automated trades, which an average investor doesn't have the capacity to do so.

My suggestion is to approach it from the Warren Buffett style of investing.

Study the company, understand the business model, and evaluate how the company is priced relative to your view of the intrinsic value.

**One important caution to this approach.**

I have also observed recently that many people tend to buy into this type of analysis: **""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and people will likely to eat out at bars and restaurants and therefore, I will buy the restaurant stocks.""**

Or this, **""Biden administration is pushing clean energy policy and EV stocks will outperform.""**

While these are good ideas to start off of, they're not the end.

It's almost like saying ""US population is increasing and more people will drive cars. Therefore, I will buy auto stocks.""

These are big leaps in assumptions. We need to fill in the gaps.

My suggestion is to think in more depth, especially in terms of numbers.

For example, ""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and restaurant visits are increasing as % of 2019 levels. Darden Restaurants is poised to benefit from this trend because it is highly specialized in an indoor dining experience and the demand is picking up, as evidenced by its growing sales numbers that are higher than its competitors. The stock is currently trading at 37x 2021 P/E, which seems to be undervalued given the fact that it is expected to grow its bottom line at more than 40% over the next three years, yielding a PEG ratio of less than 1. Its peers are also trading at 50x 2021 P/E. Therefore, if the company exceeds the profit growth expectations, the stock has a potential to outperform the market.""

This is a more in-depth fundamental analysis, divided into two parts: 1) qualitative factors that prove why the company is better positioned against its competitors and 2) quantitative factors (mainly the valuation, or what the market priced in) that will drive its stock price outperformance.

**The bottom line is, when you are picking stocks, do not make the big leap in assumptions, coupled with preliminary technical analysis. Instead, approach it from a view of an investor: ""what is good about this business and why would I buy into this company rather than its competitor who seems to be having more success? Is the company priced at an appropriate valuation? Will its market cap grow from $10B to $50B? And why?""**

Which leads me to the second topic of today's memo.

**2) Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?**

The answer is simple: it's because the market has priced in a better outlook than what's reported.

If the street consensus estimate was $2 EPS for a company and the earnings came out to $3, it doesn't mean the stock price will jump. And it can be for many different reasons.

Perhaps the company beat on the earnings but fell below the estimates on the topline.

Or the company's margins shrank dramatically.

Or the company sold lower volumes of a new line of cars than expected, which was supposed to show an exponential growth. But the higher-priced cars offset the losses and still resulted in an earnings beat. The market was pricing in the growth of the new line of cars but now that growth expectation has disappeared.

You really need to think at a high level on earnings beat. It's not a 1+1=2 type of problem.

**On top of that, you will never know what the market has priced in its growth expectations until the actual earnings come out.**

This is because we can only know what the market has priced in only after observing the stock price reaction after the earnings. Because the stock price dropped after the earnings, the market was expecting a better outcome than the actual and by definition, it is an after-the-fact analysis.

Over time, the stock price mean reverts to its earnings potential and any anomalies in the way will be reverted back.

Thus, a better game to play is to focus on its fundamentals, study the earnings, and determine if this company will outperform not just qualitatively but also from a quantitative perspective. Will it expand its trading multiple? Will the earnings outperform the street expectations?

Hope this helps and thank you for reading!

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
> # Big jobs report
> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
> # Earnings soar
> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

> # Here Comes Sell In May

> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

> # Wild Data Close To Q1

> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**

> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

Before I begin, this of course is not financial advice, I am a fucking IDIOT, and please do your own due diligence before yeeting money into this market.

Unsure what flair to use to best categorize this steaming pile of research I compiled, what I want this post to be is a discussion of my little bit of research and whether or not my plan to invest is wise.

We begin at the beginning, when I, filled with infinite wisdom, used the Finviz stock screener to find share prices that had gapped down 10% or more. ""Why did you look for this?"" you, the reader, may be thinking. It was a whim...while filled with infinite wisdom.

&#x200B;

[Note the advanced filters\/settings I used to find precisely the next big money maker](https://preview.redd.it/hia3339lfpw61.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=373101ecc7889e24644d6fc5afa58dbcb49ddf73)

I have no idea what else drew me to CRUS, other than that steep gap down, but I decided to click and dig a bit deeper.

&#x200B;

[Share price fell by over 15&#37; overnight](https://preview.redd.it/iqytqtcwgpw61.png?width=1901&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29f94b488b18bf08f1523052e6085edba92c5b4)

After seeing the large gap between closing share prices, my thought for jumping on this investment was, ""Uh, this shit sometimes pops back up or something, right?"" Before throwing money right at this company, I wanted to dig **deeper** and see what else was going on.

&#x200B;

[Some nerd shit, IDK](https://preview.redd.it/i87uf6z3ipw61.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a4ce7ac77d913e612b3901f4f4d296fb07b3706)

So, I scrolled down. I found this neat little table with a bunch of numbers on it. I can't make sense of a whole lot of it, but a few things jumped out at me:

1. *Income* (top left corner) - this number is not negative. Sick.
2. *Short Float* (top right corner-ish) - this number is low. I think this is the percentage of available shares being shorted or some shit.
3. *Target price* (below *Short Float*) - this number is green. ""Green is good"" - Dow Jones (probably, idfk)

I pretty much laid out the significance, to me, of those numbers in the list above (if it seems too simple that is because it is and I am a fuckin' idiot), but I'll explain quickly why I think the low *Short Float* number is good. This number leads me to believe that not a lot of folks are betting against the stock and that led me to believe further that the share price may come bouncing back up and prove to be a good investment for some quick cash. Cool, I got in my head that this is a good buy after looking a few not negative numbers. I should go ahead and just jump in, right? No. I must dig ***deeper***.

Through Google, I came to the SEC website with all the CRUS company filings. I clicked on the latest filing, which is an 8K. In this document, I found a whole bunch of shit I didn't understand. Also, some tables with numbers on them.

&#x200B;

[Important looking red boxes look important](https://preview.redd.it/zcuqk8wjmpw61.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=e893c26367d419d82d1146d4a207d38cca4e0751)

&#x200B;

[Some more numbers in a table](https://preview.redd.it/0na09mqpmpw61.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a34b0f25f8fb8c8ca8afec589535483a9025f550)

All of these table say pretty much the same shit, I think. I don't know, I'm not a numbers-er. In these tables I found, there are numbers that increase from one year to another, from 28 March 2020 to 27 March 2021, such as: *GAAP Net Income*, *Cash and equivalents*, and *Net sales*, to name a few. I cannot stress this enough, I don't know **shit** about **fuck**. The numbers increase over a 12 month period and that's good, right? Also, *Cash and equivalents* is an important number, which also increases and it does not look small. So now I am ready to go all in...after I ***DIG DEEPER.***

&#x200B;

[Long red boxes because I mean business](https://preview.redd.it/nfm8edlkopw61.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=6201fe5d509395a286c9cc82eab79f1370f2a4fd)

Worried that the positive difference in numbers over a 12 month period was just a fluke, I went and found the last annual filing to view the history of these so called ""numbers"". What I found was...good? Anyone can see them, I mean, they are right **there**, but I want to note that while the *Net sales* and *Net income* fluctuated, the *Cash, cash equivalents...* and *Total assets* numbers when up. That seems like some pretty good shit to me. Time to zip on over to TD Ameritrade and throw a goddamn penny at this bitch.

Just look at those lines, all colorful and shit. Look like taller and taller mountains. That **must** be a good sign. What do I know though, I'm not a doctor. Between the numbers in the aforementioned nerd tables and the price history of these shares increasing over time, I believe that the company is good for the long term and finally I decided to take a position on Monday morning: 5 shares at $75. Goddamn bold, I know. I plan to increase the size of my position over time as I free up capital.

In conclusion, I wanted to present the analysis I did before deciding to take this position, so I can discuss the analysis with strangers on the internet. Based on what I am seeing, this is a sound investment and a good time to invest. Please tear me apart.","['NDAQ', 'GPS', 'DOW']",,,,,,,

n3845y,,StockMarket,post,1619967680,"Barron’s picks Progressive insurance company as the stand out growth stock in a slow growth industry.Typically insurance companies seek growth by writing policies too cheaply.  That grows profitability initially until rising claims lead to losses and a clamp down on new business.  Progressive instead has mastered underwriting and is able to generate profits by keeping more in premiums than it pays out in claims.

Underwriting success reflects its data driven culture.  Its main business is auto insurance where it uses occupation, gender and age as usual.  However it is Progressives early investment in telematics that is paying off now.  Progressive’s app monitors driving metrics including acceleration, braking and signs of distraction.  That allows Progressive to benefit from better underwriting and customers to benefit from more competitive prices.

Barron's article says that nobody does it like Progressive.   You have to go back to 2000 to find a year when Op Costs plus claims exceeded premiums written.  That's why its forward PE of 17 is at a premium.  But compared to 5 year revenue growth of 15% p.a. and EPS growth of 25% p.a it looks cheap. 

Long term risks remain from autonomous driving and a related shift away from privately owned vehicles.  But that still looks a long way off and, with a market share of just 13% and significant competitive advantage, Progressive should be able to drive growth for 5 or ten years or longer.  Additionally Barrons pointed out that Progressive is the market leader commercial auto insurance providing an opportunity for Progressive to insure autonomous fleets as they develop.

Overall the premium to peers looks justified by superior performance.  The forward PE of 17 looks cheap compared to growth of 25% and a bargain compared to the general market.",['PGR'],,,,,,,

n3hjwl,,StockMarket,post,1619994271,"$NVDA: Short-Term Bull Thesis Formulated Synergistically Using Perennially-Tested, Fundamental Trend-Analysis with Harmonic Analysis Based on Fibonacci Symmetry (""Sacred Geometry"")Welcome,

In this analysis, we'll illustrate and explain why we have become quite bullish $NVDA in the short-term using perennial, fundamental trend analysis & harmonics (based on Fibonacci symmetry) analysis synergistically. If you are reading this, we assume you have already witnessed and/or experienced the potentially powerful and remunerative effect of sound technical analysis; hence, if you have only studied classical trend analysis techniques with supportive volume flow analysis, you are in for a treat, because we potentiate the accuracy of these tools with harmonics.

We will begin with the classical, perennially-tested, fundamental trend analysis. $NVDA has been trading within a channel with the upper rail/resistance extending from Oct '18 and the lower rail/support from Apr '19, as can be viewed in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1: https://imgur.com/a/b4KYX3i 

Upon rejection from the top rail/resistance in Sep '20, it entered into a bull flag formation; after a false breakdown from this flag & a test of the multi-year channel support in early Mar '21, it surged into a major rally & broke out of the flag mid-Apr '21. Next it was rejected from resistance extending from Sep '20 above the bull flag, causing it to retest the flag's upper rail (prior resistance) as support, which it did so successfully. All of this can be viewed in Figure 2 more clearly.

FIGURE 2: https://imgur.com/a/a1JgUHT

Henceforth, the fundamental trend analysis has allowed us to understand it's still in breakout region. Now let's thoroughly examine the short-term harmonic setups which may act as technical catalysts to fuel the breakout.

On the 45-min chart, our team has identified a bullish Gartley harmonic, which acts as the large framework--within the trend's context--of our short-term bull thesis; targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 3. Also note that the volume flow is still positive on this time frame, despite the recent sell-off; hence, such divergence in volume flow supports the bull thesis. 

FIGURE 3: https://imgur.com/a/KNiobVi

On the 15-min chart (Heiken Ashi candles), our team identified a bullish ABCD harmonic, which reinforces our short-term bull thesis; again, targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 4. Volume flow is also still largely positive/bullish, despite recent sell-off.

FIGURE 4: https://imgur.com/a/yV5RIf8

Finally, on the 5-min chart (Heiken Ashi candles), our team identified a bullish Deep Crab harmonic, which is why we believe it will show strength very early next week; again, targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 5. The volume flow is tilted towards reflecting selling, which is expected on this extremely short-term time-frame; however, the selling was not significant enough to be reflected on the previous 15-min and 45-min frames analyzed previously.

FIGURE 5: https://imgur.com/a/Ucu4UCd

Therefore, our short-term bull thesis is frameworked by the trend-analysis (i.e. trend-analysis demonstrates $NVDA's in breakout territory), and reinforced with confluently bullish harmonic internals on multiple timeframes--the ideal, golden setup for which outperforming traders exercise the most difficult element of trading: patience.


DISCLOSURE: We do not currently hold any position in $NVDA; however, we will be looking to enter long early in the upcoming week (i.e. Mon morning) if the price remains above the invalidation levels and below the initial targets.

n38v70,,StockMarket,post,1619969726,"CGI Inc. revisited: Global Tech Compounder for a Digital Age6.3% FCF Yield  
18% 10 Year Annualized Return  
22.7% FCF CAGR since 2001  
57% Adj. EBITDA to FCF since 2015  
(GIB: NYSE, GIB.A:TSX)

In it’s [2021 technology industry outlook](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/technology-industry-outlook.html), Deloitte identified three critical issues in a post-COVID world. The first of these applies to all sectors and services: digital transformation. *“Facing new pressures and constraints, companies are working to improve their agility and flexibility, increase automation, and move to more real-time operations. Accelerating digital transformation efforts will likely take a rededication to improving cloud infrastructure, data and analytics capabilities, and cybersecurity. It will also likely require a renewed focus on business model transformation and ecosystem development. Growth opportunities abound for tech companies that execute on all forms of digital transformation, particularly in the areas of cloud, XaaS, analytics, RPA, AI, cybersecurity, and edge computing.”*

This is the core of CGI’s business model.

CGI Inc, also known as CGI Group Inc, is among the largest independent IT and business consulting services firms in the world. They deliver end-to-end managed services from strategic IT and business consulting to systems integration, managed IT and business process services including SaaS, cloud and cybersecurity, alongside intellectual property solutions for government and corporate clients. CGI works with clients through a local relationship model complemented by a global delivery network that helps clients digitally transform their organizations and accelerate results.  They recorded $12B in revenue in 2020 with a market cap of $27B.

The focus on digital transformation was the highlight of their [recent Q2F21 earnings](https://www.cgi.com/en/2021-04-28-CGI-reports-strong-second-quarter-Fiscal-2021-results), where CGI reported their highest quarterly bookings since 2015, with TTM bookings at a record high. The company posted 126% book-to-bill for Q2 (of which 40% was new business, above historical average) and 113% TTM — these make up part of the $23B backlog of services. Book-to-bill is an important leading indicator which signals positive organic growth after a decline during COVID.

Since 2001, CGI has seen revenues compound at an annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4%, and a Free Cash Flow 22.7% CAGR. 2020 FCF was $1.6B and 2021 estimates are \~$1.8B. In the same timeframe, CGI has ROIC of 16.2% CAGR, alongside net profit margins of 11.3% CAGR.

The current FCF Yield stands at 6.3% . Revenue growth is estimated to be 3.4% in FY22. These estimates may be conservative if book-to-bill % is maintained or trends higher, which is management’s expectation, so there is room for upside here compared to analyst estimates of -6% booking YoY in 2022.

As a growth by acquisition story, management indicated that valuations are more attractive now and therefore M&A is another near-term catalyst: they recently acquired Austin-based Sense Corp for an estimated $66mm. They also reiterated their target to achieve double-digit annual EPS growth and double the company’s size in 5–7 years through its build-and-buy model. Analysts have been expecting a large “transformative” acquisition for a little while (the last one being Logica in 2012). Big or small, either way it shouldn’t be a problem: CGI averaged 13% EPS growth annually since 2010 (29.4% CAGR) and is a disciplined capital allocator.

The reinvestment runway and secular growth story remains robust and accelerating thanks to COVID. There moat here is narrow and the IT business is sticky. CGI contracts are typically in the 5-10 year range ([see: 10-year renewal with Canadian aviation training company CAE Inc](https://www.cgi.com/en/2021-02-02-CAE-expands-strategic-partnership-with-CGI) / [wildfire mapping with the European Space Agency](https://www.cgi.com/en/2021-02-22-European-Space-Agency-selects-CGI-to-develop-services-combining-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Earth-Observation-for-Wildfire-Mapping) / [evolve IT infrastructure for the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice](https://www.cgi.com/en/2021-03-11-Bavarian-State-Ministry-of-Justice-selects-CGI-to-drive-digitization-and-innovation)). These contracts provide ample visibility and secure recurring revenue streams. The global software consulting market is also expected to reach $427B by growing at a CAGR exceeding +11% from 2021 to 2027.",,,,,,,,

You Really Don’t Own the Shares that Appear in Your Brokerage Account; They Belong to Cede


Content from the article:

Most investors when they buy a publicly traded stock believe that they own a part of some company. 

They think that somewhere there is a stock certificate or some indication of ownership that has their name on it, but this is not the case. 

When you buy a “stock” you are actually purchasing a security that affords certain entitlement rights related to registered stock which actual owners hold. 

The registered shares of a private company are directly owned by shareholders. In contrast, the registered shares of nearly all publicly traded equities are owned by Cede & Co., which is the nominee of the Depository Trust Company (DTC). (A nominee is a company whose name is given as having title to a stock, but does not receive the financial benefits of ownership.) 

Cede is a subsidiary of the Depository Trust Company (DTC) which is a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the DTCC is a private company owned by elite Wall Street firms and money center banks. 

If you need background or a refresher on DTC and DTCC, click on this link. Effectively, elite Wall Street firms and money center banks, not institutions and individual investors, own almost all of the registered shares of publicly traded companies in the US.

The DTC is a depository that holds securities of publicly traded stocks in street name (not to be confused with registered stock) for some 600 broker-dealers and banks who have accounts with it. 

Bear with me, I will explain what street name securities are shortly, but be clear that they are not the registered securities held by Cede & Co. which never leave its vault. It is street name securities that are held in inventories of brokers and are traded from broker to broker in the public markets. 

These street name securities have contractual rights to the financial benefits of the registered shares owned by Cede and also convey voting rights on corporate governance matters.

Brokers in the aggregate hold inventories of street name securities located in accounts at the DTC. Investor accounts lodged with brokers are also held at the DTC. 

When we investors buy a stock through a broker it is noted as a digital entry in the DTC’s electronic bookkeeping system so that the broker becomes our nominee. 

The upshot is that almost all U.S. investors are beneficial rather than registered owners of a stock. This entitles us to receive financial benefits such as dividends and to vote on corporate governance issues. 

While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock. Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.

Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. 

Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. 

At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares. I discussed how this is done in series 7 of my illegal naked shorting series.





So what is the Harm?

Let me anticipate and answer talking counterpoints that would be made by the DTCC, elite Wall Street firms and hedge funds who flourish in our current clearing and settlement system. 

I think they would point to prodigious market liquidity and cheap execution of trades. A small investor can put in a buy or sell market order for a 1000 shares of a stock and have it executed in a second and only have to pay $5 or $10. 

They would then say that investors still retain all of the financial benefits accorded registered shareholders and the ability to vote on corporate affairs. So they would say, isn’t that great? Yes it is great.

Here is what is not so great. We have all been sold the fiction that when we buy a stock, we have become proud owners of a great American corporation. 

Our investment is funding that Company and America’s growth. This is not an accurate description. 

As I will show in this report, we are actually involved in commodity trading of street name securities in which the trading of and record keeping is completely controlled by DTCC and the elite Wall Street firms with no transparency for outsiders. 

Operating in this black hole of important information they use loopholes in the clearing and settlement system administered by DTCC and loopholes in the ineffective SHO regulations to create counterfeit shares at will. 

They can and do expand the supply of street name securities through creating counterfeit shares to overwhelm demand and drive down the stock price.

You can see this scheme at work almost on an almost daily basis. All too often, when a Company reports approval of an important new product, the stock trades up slightly and then trades down to a lower price than before the announcement  to the amazement of investors who are long the stock. 

The same thing can happen with achievement of a meaningful, clinical, regulatory or financial milestone. Why? Because there are hedge funds who have been shorting the stock and have huge outstanding short positions who stand to suffer huge losses if the stock price increases. 

In self-defense, they launch a short attack spearheaded by creating counterfeit shares arising from illegal naked shorting. The clear intent is to make good or great news appear to be badly received. 

Jim Cramer was a long time hedge fund manager before becoming a commentator on CNBC. In this famous interview,  he fills us in on how he and other hedge funds routinely manipulated stocks.

God forbid, if a company you are invested in reaches a point that it becomes apparent that it has to raise equity. The hedge fund gang jumps in and start shorting in anticipation of an offering. 

The hedge funds have had great success in persuading other investors that equity offerings are bad for investors because it dilutes their shares. In most cases, this argument is total nonsense because companies are raising money to enable the completion of projects that will enable them to become successful, i.e. executing an important clinical trial, building infrastructure, etc. 

Raising equity to enable companies to grow is the cornerstone for our successful economic system. Claiming that equity raises are dilutive and harmful is something that Vladimir Lenin might have said.

In the vast majority of cases, the stock slides sharply when the deal is announced. For small emerging companies, the offering is then priced by Wall Street investment bankers at a 10% discount to the already distressed price and often warrants must be attached in order to attract buyers who all too often the hedge funds who have shorted the stock. 

Yes, I know this is illegal, but hedge fund A buys stock on an offering to cover for hedge fund B who has been shorting and they switch positions to cover the short and split the profits. 

This is a routine practice. In the end, this does lead to enormous share dilution, which causes untold harm to investors and emerging companies who are so important to economic growth. 

The winners are Wall Street and hedge fund employees and real estate brokers in the Hamptons.







The Move to Electronic Trading of Stocks, Some Background

In previous reports, I discussed the system of clearing and settlement of stocks that was used up until the late 1960’s that relied on messengers physically delivering registered shares and cash. 

As trading exploded, this physical delivery system was overwhelmed and created a major crisis. This necessitated a move toward a paperless, electronic system as a replacement. This new process evolved over the next few decades.

In moving from the old system of physically delivering securities for settlement to a paperless, electronic scheme, a number of difficult issues had to be addressed. 

Perhaps the most serious was that registered shares are like pieces of property. They physically belong to the owner. Transferring ownership involves a legal process in which the previous owner signs over shares to the purchaser comparable to selling a house. 

The obvious solution would seem to be to transfer ownership electronically. However, a major stumbling block was that all 50 states had different ways of treating the transfer of registered shares and each would have to pass new legislation to allow this to happen, a process that could be very long and involved. 

I am not sure that technology at the time existed that could allow electronic transfer of ownership although it could be done easily with today’s technology.

Over time, the architects of the evolving electronic trading system did come up with a solution for dealing with registered stock. 

In retrospect and unfortunately for many companies (especially emerging growth stocks) and investors in those companies, the fix they settled on has loopholes that allows illegal naked shorting and creation of massive amounts of counterfeit shares. 

This allows hedge funds to aggressively manipulate stocks. 

The designers were almost totally focused on providing liquidity and settlement security to the market and gave little thought to almost everything else. Central to their plan was the dematerialization and immobilization of registered shares. Here is what they came up with.






Why Was Cede Created

In 1999, the DTCC formed a subsidiary called Cede and made it the nominee for all registered shares in the US. 

This meant that Cede’s name appears on registered shares so that today virtually all shares of publicly traded companies in the US are owned by Cede and are immobilized in a central vault. 

For each registered share, the DTC created a corresponding share that conferred to the owner most of the financial and corporate ownership benefits of registered shares such as receiving dividends , voting in proxies and so on. 

These are financial derivatives of registered shares that are fungible (commodity-like) which is referred to as dematerializing the registered shares. This meant they could be traded freely without any need for transferring ownership. 

These securities are now known as street name securities. Securities held in street name are legally distinct from the registered shares held by Cede & Co.






More on Street Name Securities

All of the stock trading in public markets is now done in street name by the DTC and its 600 or so member firms and participants who have accounts at the DTC. 

Through digital book keeping entries the DTC keeps track of the street name positions of all of these firms. 

In turn, these firms maintain corresponding digitally based accounts of the stock holdings of their clients.

Brokers have an inventory of street name shares in their accounts which are fungible and can be transferred back and forth electronically allowing for trades to be cleared almost instantaneously. 

They also maintain and update the security holder records for clients, facilitate or execute selling and buying and provide other services. 

This means that all DTCC stock trading which is tantamount to all stock trading in the US is done with street name securities which are a financial derivative of registered shares.






Trading in Street Name Allows for Continuous Net Settlement

As customers execute buy and sell orders, brokers interact with the DTCC and other brokers all on an electronic basis and their inventory builds and declines accordingly. 

This is done through continuous net settlement which I described in detail in Part 7: Illegal Naked Shorting: DTCC Continuous Net Settlement and Stock Borrowing Programs Have Loopholes That Facilitate Illegal Naked Shorting

don’t want to reiterate my discussion on continuous net settlement, but it is important to refresh you on a couple of points. 

During the course of each trading day, clearing brokers may execute hundreds or tens of thousands of buy and sell orders. 

Instead of matching each buy order with a corresponding sell order, these trades are executed out of the inventory of street name shares of the member firms. 

This inventory consists of all the shares held in their customer accounts as well as their proprietary trading accounts. 

At the end of the day, they sum up all of the buys and sells and if there is a surplus of buys, this is added to their inventory of street name shares at the DTCC and if there is a deficit, it is subtracted. 

It is very important to understand that clearing brokers are not matching each order between buyer and seller. They are buying and selling for their inventory.

Let’s look at what this means. Let’s say that there are 10,000,000 registered shares of Company XYZ held at Cede, which means that there are 10,000,000 shares held in street name. 

Let’s say that Merrell, Lynch at the beginning of the day, holds 1,000,000 shares of its client’s shares in street name. Now let’s say that throughout a trading day that Merrill Lynch clients sold 100,000 more of those shares than they bought. 

At the end of the day, (technically on settlement day at T+2) this would mean that the Merrill position would be reduced to 900,000 shares in street name and that 100,000 shares in street name would be transferred by the DTC to various other brokers. 

Technically, there is an adjustment for failed to deliver securities, but we can ignore this for the sake of this example.

All of the DTC participants transact securities in street name that are swapped back and forth like incoming and outgoing tides on a shore. 

In theory, the number of shares held in street name by the DTC participants does not vary. Just as with the actual 10,000,000 registered shares held by Cede, there should 10,000,000 shares held in street name by Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the many other participants. 

In theory then, the number of street name shares should equal the registered shares sitting in Cede’s vault. In practice, Wall Street creates massive numbers of counterfeit shares. 

Some informed observers have speculated that in some cases, the number of counterfeit shares issued can match or exceed registered shares. 

Once created, the DTCC does not differentiate between counterfeit and legitimate street name securities.






There is no Transparency with the Electronic Clearing and Settlement System That we now Use

A critical shortcoming of the DTCC electronic system is total lack of transparency to outsiders and even to the SEC which is supposed to be the regulator of the securities industry. 

Only the DTCC and broker dealers who own the DTCC have access to the entirety of data showing who actually bought and sold shares and to determine if illegal naked shorting has created counterfeit shares. 

This information is or should be readily available but attempts to access it are stonewalled and met with determined resistance.

There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.","['WM', 'RSG', 'HBI']",,,,,,,

n2ulyl,,StockMarket,post,1619913045,"Target prices for OXY? - OXY trending down, confusing why with oil prices staying above $60 a barrel. Seems like OXY is significantly undervalued. Curious on people's thoughts.The obvious downside to OXY is potential weakness that resurfaces again in the oil market and it's debt load. Although, as long as the oil market stays reasonable price it's debt load seems highly manageable. Also, if the oil market stays reasonably priced for the next year or so I think it's highly likely OXY redeclares dividends which should boost it's stock price. 

&#x200B;

Specifically, for their last quarter, 4Q2020, and pursuant to their earning call slides, they had cash flow from operations, before working capital expenditures, of $1.4 billion.

&#x200B;

Those same slide indicated an approximately $215 million annual cash flow, or $53.75 million quarterly cash flow increase per $1 increase of oil prices.

&#x200B;

Pursuant to OXY's 10-k, the average realized oil price for 2020 was $39.

&#x200B;

The average oil price for this year has varied between $47.62 and  $67.98. With essentially all of this year being above $50. Thus, a conservative approximation of average realized oil price is probably at least $53 barrel. 

&#x200B;

That's a difference of at least $14 per barrel translating to a quarterly cash flow increase of $752.5 million and, adding that to 4Q2020, cash flow, giving a quarterly cash flow of $2.152 billion. 

&#x200B;

In the same 4Q2020 earning slides, there is a projected 2021 cap ex expenditures of $2.9 billion, or $725 million. per quarter. Thus, giving $1.4 billion in free cash flow generation. 

&#x200B;

Pursuant to OXY's 4Q2020 10-k, OXY's biggest yearly debt burden is in the next 6 years through 2026, with several $1 billion debt maturing and a $3 billion debt maturing. The total debt maturing in the next 6 years is $13.565 billion, which averages out to $2.260 billion per year, or $560 million per quarter.

&#x200B;

Thus, with oil at or above $53 barrel and generating $1.4 billion in free cash flow generation, it should be more than enough to plan for and pay off OXY's significant debt payments coming in the next 6 years. Allocating the amount as calculated above, it would leave about $840 million per quarter in free cash flow after debt payments. 

&#x200B;

That should be more than sufficient to bring back substantial dividends, maybe not at the same level as before but could easily be in the $0.50 to $0.7 per quarter range, and, thus, over $2 per year. 

&#x200B;

With dividends of $2 per year, and assuming an approximately 6% yield, it would give the stock price a value of $33.33. 

&#x200B;

Altogether, it seems as long as WTI oil is at or above $50 a barrel OXY's ability to handle it's debt is pretty safe and it begins to turn back into a cash flow giant. All of these numbers above feel fairly conservative, at least to me, since this quarter oil is likely to average closer to the $60 mark then the $50 mark which simply makes the case for OXY more compelling. Also, the world is beginning to come back to normal so there's a good chance oil demand increase even further driving oil prices higher. 

&#x200B;

The if here, which is admittedly a big if, is the stability of oil prices and the oil market. Overall though, it does seem like OXY is undervalued and, if you have faith in the oil market, OXY is significantly undervalued. 

&#x200B;

Curious of people's thoughts on this. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: With oil market stabilizing/stabilized, it seems like OXY can safely handle it's debt and is likely a cash flow giant. Seems underpriced to me, a little confused why OXY hasn't trended up more with WTI oil recently trending up back above $60 per barrely. barely",['OXY'],,,,,,,

That is nearly double the current rate of 20%.

Many want to know what changes, if any, they should make to their investments. And others are worried about how markets will fare under a higher-tax rate environment.

“Conversations about taxes have picked up over the last two weeks,” said Marc Scudillo, managing officer of EisnerAmper Wealth Management & Corporate Benefits LLC. “This is coming much faster than people anticipated,” Mr. Scudillo added, referring to some investors’ belief that Mr. Biden wouldn’t attempt a tax overhaul until 2022.

A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data.

While the proposal requires approval by Congress, where it will be subject to negotiations and possible changes, here is what experts say investors should take away from the plan:

**Not all investments would be subject to the new tax rate.**

Most investors hold a variety of assets, ranging from taxable brokerage accounts to IRAs and employer-sponsored savings plans like 401(k)s. Only some of these accounts are taxable.

In fact, in a Tax Policy Center study, analysts estimated just a quarter of U.S. corporate stocks are held in taxable accounts, down from more than four-fifths in 1965. Much of the rest appears to be held in accounts that are exempt from taxes, including retirement accounts, pension funds and, in many cases, assets owned by foreign investors.

n1ttf5,,StockMarket,post,1619789216,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/qg04a2wabbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0486800be95f3c49097df601935236a2bc500b11

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

https://preview.redd.it/xq68n5kbbbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=327a831304a22ffb7588037b74da15e2de559e9b

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

n2hd18,,StockMarket,post,1619871985,"Trading OTC vs Listed (NASDAQ/NYSE) 

Watched some interviews with successful day traders, who are students of tim skyes, and they mentioned how it is different trading OTC vs listed, that they just stick to OTC.

So some of the reasons they mentioned were that OTC charts tend to be more cleaner (which i guess to be respecting support and resistance lines more; forming better setups that offer an easy stop), less prone to manipulation and algo trading (thus less noise and cleaner ?).

Personally for me I’ve been trying to learn trading with listed big cap high volume stocks (with high volume options) because i’m using a small account (at least starting small), hence i wanna keep spreads as small as possible. And it doesn’t help that OTC has a 6.95 fee that eats away a chunk of my profits / magnify my losses.

Can someone please provide more insight and explanation regarding the **differences** between trading OTC and listed, as well as the **implications**? Is there one that is objectively/markedly **better/easier**?

Adjusted to fix big ticker mistake on my part - Paramount Pictures is owned by Viacom (thanks heroes for the facts). **Do not confuse this with the real estate group.**

*Thank you for patience, I am just an idiot trying to share with my bro's to the best of my ability!*

Hasbro & Paramount Pictures (OWNED BY VIACOM) are aligned for a new golden era of toys and imaginative entertainment in a way we haven't seen since the mid 90's. I'm excited as $#%! about these toys, and the FUN entertainment coming soon.

Part 1

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**$HAS (Hasbro)**  

Hasbro toys are at peak engineering after years of investment, with careful ""wave"" rollouts to reduce overproduction to market demand, and are breaking out of the ""Collector"" zone that has plagued toys for 30 years.

Through their partnership with Disney (see Star Wars Black series of toys) and Marvel (see Legends series of toys), Hasbro has carefully and diligently engineered innovative new action figure features.

&#x200B;

[ Innovative designs create realistic postures without sacrificing durability ](https://preview.redd.it/vphcu9luqfw61.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9b2ba9ae2bbede755e8c24fc5c203ea83581d0)

**Supply & Demand**


COVID was a major threat to most industries. Hasbro, however, may have benefited.

Let me explain.

Hasbro had GI Joe Classified figures supply totally dried up. They didn't expect the major resurgence of interest in the line, and had largely ramped up to sell to Collectors, like they have for 30 years now. This spike in demand, paired with scalpers (who are earning video game console release-level Scalping money on these toys), have made it virtually impossible for the regular customers to buy them.

* Target exclusives - sold out on day 1. Restock still pending for 6+ months
* Hasbro direct - sold out
* Ebay - Holy moly... $$$$
* Hasbro's inability to rapidly produce at the start of COVID actually... helped. They got tons of market feedback, resulting in a re-paint on previously release character. People wanted a less cartoonish appearance, and more realistic color choices. **This is a very Agile approach, and the results are incredible.**
* Efficiency with the line - Instead of small and giant Joes, they have **one Medium size 6""** that is standard with EVERY OTHER LINE - Disney, Marvel, and more. The toybox just got a standard unit of measure. **Even the freaking heads and hands are interchangeable!**
* **Small lineups in each wave** \- 2 to 6 figures in each push, careful planning, and using similar elements for future characters to reduce manufacturing turnarounds. Profits, baby!
* They were able to align toy plans with the delayed Snake Eyes film. See the [action figures slated for October release](https://www.entertainmentearth.com/product/gi-joe-classified-series-6inch-action-figures-wave-6-case-of-6/hse8346f).

**But the best part that tells me they are about to make great strides is the response to scalpers, and news about major productions to meet demand coming soon.**

“[If any of you are scalpers in here, get your high price now](https://toy-wizards.com/2020/12/04/g-i-joe-classified-repaints-and-more-on-the-way-for-2021/)”.

Hasbro restocks just started to hit Walmart and other online sellers in the last couple of weeks, finally filling orders that have been queued up for some time.

Folks - we have not even hit the summer movies that are going to redefine GI Joe for the next generation. This demand hasn't even started to hit peak.

Which leads me to Part 2...

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**$VIAC (Paramount pictures is owned by Viacom, NOT the other ticker which is a real estate group)** 
 
Ok - Hasbro doesn't operate in a silo. It thrives based on engaging with young people (and old Toys R Us kids who never grew up like me) based on intellectual properties from all forms of entertainment companies.

The first attempt at GI Joe was about as well received as the Hulk movies. Swing and a miss. But the cat was also out of the bag in both of those cinematic universes, and it hurt a bit.

Then came Iron Man. Iron man did not disown the previous, but it did choose to pave a new path forward. It was an incredible (pun intended) business decision, and we all saw how they defined the market for the last decade+.

Enter Paramount with Snake Eyes origins move, coming this July. This is the ""Iron Man"" of the Hasbro toy lines. GI Joe is about to level up, and we are going to see a huge wave of nostalgia as well as next gen kids who finally have the toy lines to match a modern play experience.

Amazon has Lady Jaye show lined up for Paramount as well. Its coming folks. Its getting real.

**GI Joe/Transformers crossover movie?** Still on the table for pre-production. And Transformers is due for a reboot too (Yes, time flies, but it has been a LOOONG time already).

**The Rock?** In for life still.

And with EACH OF THESE, a careful, lean, well engineered line of toys compatible with the rest in your toybox.

**Paramount is about to get a LOT of attention for their IP in the next decade.**

**Current prices & Valuations**

* **Are these shorted stocks like we have seen in big plays on WSB?**  

   * **No.** I do not believe these are the type of stock where we are sticking it to the hedge funds in any way. To be clear, I am a believer in QUALITY toys, and I just really really love what they are building together.
   * Viacom does have some short interest, [but it has reduced by \~40% in a month](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/)
* **Ok, so if they aren't shorted, are they undervalued today?**  

   * Do some DD yourselves, and I would love to hear opinions, but I believe they are fairly priced now, and have a clear history of growth with the business as it stands today.
   * **HOWEVER! I strongly believe they are FAR underpriced compared to what will happen in July this year, through end of the year.**
   * I am also LONG on them beyond the growth I anticipate this year. 2023-2025 will yield even more movie properties relaunching that are going to EXPLODE demand for these goods, and create engagement for the far future entertainment offerings from Paramount.
* **Everything on the market is overvalued... isn't it?**  

   * Maybe. However, I suspect Hasbro is a bit low key to date. **I don't believe they have been impacted by strong speculation that other stocks have seen in the market today.**
   * Viacom had a huge run up. However, I think the price is more than fairly valued at about what it was pre-Covid decline. **This means adding IP to streaming and theaters on balanced budget productions can yield BIG returns and even BIGGER engagement from audiences.**

* **Company Financials**  

   * You should look for yourself, but [Hasbro is an extremely profitable company already](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HAS:NASDAQ?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiq36yD4KbwAhUMHDQIHcE_ANYQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw). More tendies coming.
   * $HAS with a market cap of $13.61B, 137,559,000 shares outstanding makes it very appealing to me as a fairly priced opportunity for what it is today. I think this leaves tons of room for pushing new heights.
   * Cash on hand of 1.3 BILLION dollars means low chances of share dilution going forward and more than enough capital to support rapid scaling production.
   * **Paramount Pictures (VIAC)** \- **They're building the partnerships with Amazon and others needed to make this a serious opportunity for these major intellectual properties and a cinematic universe.**  

      * There are probably better VIAC DD out there than I can possibly do as an illiterate. This is closer to a major catalyst than a proper VIAC DD. But it has CRITICAL synergy to Hasbro's future.
      * An example of more recent DD is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0r0n8/goldman_sachs_viacomcbs_inc_viac_buy_the_most/) from [u/DrApeKing](https://www.reddit.com/u/DrApeKing/) (I don't know, he has a good name)
* **Positions or ban**  

   * I don't have much to spend. I am in HAS for 10 shares at $98.75
   * I plan to buy Viacom next week as it is at a really great price IMHO after tanking from previous March pumps. $1000 bucks it what I consider a lot to put in, and that's my intent.
   * I also now own some of the Real Estate group stock because I am illiterate (name checks out)
   * I don't do Calls or Puts because I can't afford to lose everything. You do you!
   * Yes, I plan to buy more constantly, as I can afford to add more to my positions.

**\~\~TL;DR\~\~**

**More reasons for Viacom! Also, Excuses for toys!**

**Adults and kids want these action figures with more demand than we have seen since the mid 90's. Snake Eyes movie and GI JOE Amazon shows are going to explode toy demand, and Paramount Pictures (Viacom) is finally lined up to launch a true blockbuster entertainment franchise to turn into a major profitable entertainment company.**

**The last decade of toys were iterative engineering efforts, and the payout starts THIS YEAR on those investments.**

**Both companies are set to play well to each other's strengths, and surge demand for their toys and entertainment together.**

n224jr,,StockMarket,post,1619812942,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 30, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 30, 2021**

The market fell on Friday after a record-setting session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) pulling back after recording fresh intraday highs. Market participants continue to assess the slew of corporate earnings reports and recent, encouraging economic data. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Shares of Amazon (AMZN) outperformed the market, jumping to a new record high after reporting blowout Q1 earnings fueled by sustained demand, showing great strength even as the economy in the US begins to reopen. Shares of Twitter, on the other hand, sunk after the company fell short of estimates, disappointing investors who hoped the company would show a strong pick-up in ad sales like peers Snap (SNAP) and Facebook (FB).

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. 
* Personal income jumped 21.1% in March over February, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. This came in better than the 20.3% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Shares of Nio outperformed the broader market, trading roughly 2% higher after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.

# Revenue and Earnings Beat

Net sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the FactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion. The sales beat was driven by growth in Nokia’s mobile networks unit — due to strong sales of 5G equipment — and its network infrastructure segment.

Citi analysts expected the “very strong” revenue and operating profit beat to drive significant upgrades to 2021 consensus forecasts. They noted that while the guidance remains unchanged, management said the first quarter provides a solid base for hitting the higher end of its 7% to 10% operating margin range. They maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of €3.55.

# NOK's 5G segment gains traction

Nokia has been working globally to deploy its 5G solutions. **The company was recently** [**determined**](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/04/28/nokia-ranked-as-number-one-in-5g-patents/) **to have the most number of essential 5G patents of any operator by independent analysts at PA Consulting.**

* 5G mobile networks services expected to increase 5-8 percent by end of 2023.
* Restructuring plan that prioritized mobile networks – including 5G – along with wired infrastructure (fiber), cloud and network services, and Nokia technologies.
* NOK is deploying a 5G network in the UAE in conjunction with Etisalat, a major telecom operator in the emerging markets sector.
* Partnering with Telefonica Spain to help deploy 5G service to Spain's residents by upgrading the telecom's IP network.
* NOK will work with NewCore Wireless to use the Tribal Educational Broadband Service (EBS) to deploy wireless broadband connectivity – including 5G – to rural and underserved Native American communities.
* New MIMO radios coming soon
* Dish Network is going to be using their NetGuard solution for their cloud native open RAN 5G witless network (this is HUGE) - cred: u/BATTLECATHOTS

• housing market is INSANE right now. Many houses being sold well above asking price. Housing shortage throughout the country. 4 million houses short of buyer demand (per WSJ HERE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400) 

• Fed is keeping interest rates low, which is incentivizing people to buy, refinance, and so forth. Anecdote, I refinanced my house in February because it was only $3,000 cost to me, but I would save buckets over the life of the loan. 

• Rising cost of lumber is forcing new homes to be more expensive. Thus, mortgage companies are financing *more* money. 

• $RKT releases earnings on Wednesday, which will be a huge catalyst of what’s to come. Last earnings they went through the roof, gaining near 100% in the short term. 

• $RKT’s competition $LDI smashed earnings this morning with $0.98 EPS, compared to an expected $0.58 EPS. LDI seems to be a much smaller company, and I think this could be indicative of a huge beat for RKT. 

• currently 8% short interest (pretty low, but the stock itself also has relatively low volume)

Greetings fellow degenerates. I present to you an undervalued, contrarian play that would make Burry proud.

The DD is divided into four parts:

1. ViacomCBS: Company overview, management changes post-merger in 2019, and current digital transformation initiatives (Paramount+ and Pluto TV)
2. Death of a beached whale: Stock blow up.
3. Why VIAC is a fantastic buying opportunity in a severely overbought market: A behemoth trading well below its fair value.
4. My position.

# 1. Overview

ViacomCBS Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media conglomerate formed through the merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom on December 4, 2019. The company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately **700 million subscribers in approximately 180 countries, as of 2019.** It comprises of five major units:

&#x200B;

* **CBS Entertainment Group** consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television and CBS Television Stations. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.
* **Domestic Media Networks** encompasses the pay television channels owned by ViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy  Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix.      ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels  listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* **International Networks** encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in  Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in  Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18. This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.

* **Global Distribution Group** focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

***Leadership***

ViacomCBS is headed by Robert Bakish.  Bakish holds a Bachelor of Science in operations research from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science and also earned an MBA from Columbia Business School. He has been with Viacom (per-merger enitiy) since February 1997, joining initially as Vice President of Planning and Development.

**Head of international operations:** In January 2007 Bakish became President of MTV Networks International (MTVNI), overseeing all MTV Networks operations outside the U.S. He immediately restructured MTVNI, cutting 8% of the workforce in addition to merging some overseas units with the UK business and devolving responsibilities for Latin American operations to new offices across the region. He launched the popular Colors franchise of networks via the Viacom18 joint venture in the high-growth market of India. MTVNI had double-digit, year-on-year growth during his tenure.

**CEO:** In January 2011, Bakish was promoted to the newly created position of President and CEO of Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN). During his tenure, Bakish expanded Viacom's international footprint, and VIMN was Viacom's most successful division; revenue doubled, and VIMN grew to more than 200 television channels. Under his leadership, the Paramount Channel was launched, offering movies and television shows in Europe, Latin America and Russia. He oversaw the expansion of networks such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Spike to an increasing number of foreign markets, and helped orchestrate the acquisition of Channel 5 in the UK and Telefe in Argentina. He also oversaw the launch of apps, including the Viacom Play Plex suite of branded mobile TV apps and the BET Play direct-to-consumer subscription video-on-demand app for an adult audience.

In October 2016, Bakish was named acting President and CEO of Viacom effective November 15, replacing interim CEO Tom Dooley. Simultaneously, he was also appointed President and CEO of the newly created Viacom Global Entertainment Group, combining Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) with Viacom's Music and Entertainment group, which includes MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Spike TV and Logo TV; two additional networks, TV Land and CMT, also joined the Global Entertainment Group. Optimistic that Bakish could make good on his plans to turn Viacom's core U.S. cable networks and its Paramount Pictures film studio around, the board of directors of Viacom Inc. made Bakish's appointment as President and CEO permanent on December 12, 2016.

In early 2017, **Bakish laid out a five-point plan to turn Viacom around and return the company to steady profitability**. This consisted of focusing on Viacom's six flagship brands: BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Paramount; revitalizing content and talent; deepening distributor and advertiser partnerships to **drive traditional revenue; increasing digital offerings, consumer products and live experiences; and optimizing and energizing the organization**. The strategy also included having Paramount Pictures develop films and franchises connected to Viacom television content; additionally, Spike TV would be rebranded as and converted to a broad-based general entertainment channel, the Paramount Network, in early 2018.

By the fall of 2017 Bakish had restructured Viacom, replacing executives at nearly every company, including hiring Jim Gianopulos - formerly chairman and CEO of 20th Century Fox, as the new chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures.

**In 2018, Bakish's implementation of his five-point comprehensive strategy was credited with Viacom's much improved finances and improved company morale and focus**. In 2018, under Bakish's direction and in accordance with his plan to capture younger and digital markets, Viacom acquired digital platform WhoSay, internet video conference VidCon, and online television network AwesomenessTV. In early 2018, Bakish also announced the launch of an official Viacom streaming service, which will support ads and will include series and content from Viacom that hasn't been available on other streaming services. In April 2018, Viacom launched Viacom Digital Studios, which will create new original content hosted on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. In addition, later that June, Bakish announced that Viacom will produce some new series exclusively for Netflix, beginning with Nickelodeon related content.

Post merger, Bakish swiftly started streamlining and managing operating costs, especially during the pandemic. In May 2020, ViacomCBS initiated a round of post-merger layoffs across all parts of the company but primarily hitting divisions within the CBS Entertainment Group. The was part of a restructuring of various operations at CBS as part of the integration with Viacom, as well as nod to changes in the business including those related to COVID. Bakish has targeted $750 million in synergies from the combination and the company said it had eliminated 450 positions. That has risen as the year progressed. “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, we were already in a period of significant change to integrate our newly combined company – work that is helping us weather this crisis, creatively adapt and strengthen the resiliency of our business,” Bakish wrote. “It’s critical that we continue these efforts to integrate and evolve ViacomCBS to remain competitive now and for the future\*\*.  This means continuing to integrate and streamline our operations, manage our costs as diligently as we can, and follow through on our committed post-merger synergy targets.\*\*”

***Current operations and growth driver***

As noted above, one of the largest pay-TV service providers with a diverse portfolio of network subsidiaries, broadcast rights, and content library for all audience demographics. VIAC generates 37% of its Revenue from CBS (primarily CBS and CW Broadcast stations), 34% from Cable Networks (Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV), 11% from Paramount (movie and TV studio), 8% from Showtime, and 7% from Local Media (Owned and Operated affiliates). In terms of the type of revenue, 40% is advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7pycluoxvsw61.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=70224b7981b50216a101f302b7fbfa7e3a9e32be

Streaming services are the key growth driver for VIAC. Although, the thesis isn't based on VIAC becoming a streaming powerhouse it's important to discuss where they can easily derive growth to exceed expectations. Currently, they operate two platforms PlutoTV and Paramount+. PlutoTV is a free ad-supported streaming TV service. It currently has 43M monthly active users with a management target of 100-120M by 2024. Paramount+ is a more standard streaming platform ($4.99 for ad-supported and $9.99 for premium). It leverages VIAC's deep content library, news subsidiaries, and is differentiated in its offerings of live sports Overall, streaming revenue is $2.6bn with a management target of $7bn by 2024 with 30M current subscribers and management targets of 65-75M subscribers by 2024.

Paramount+ has a very attractive kid-focused value proposition. This [article](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/) discusses the most popular kids' shows in 2021 and the top two are unsurprisingly **Paw Patrol and Spongebob Squarepants which are both owned by VIAC.**

Secondly, there is a differentiated live sports offering with VIAC having signed contracts with numerous major sporting events to be hosted on Paramount+. The service will feature **over 1,000 live sporting events per year**, including regular-season games, playoffs, championships and more across the following marquee properties: *The NFL on CBS,* The Masters, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship, PGA TOUR and Championship, *SEC on CBS,* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League. **Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.**

Management is aggressively focused on investing in growth initiatives leveraged to streaming platforms that are both subscription-supported and advertising-supported (as seen by their $3bn equity raise in late March. More on this in the next section).

VIAC has great streaming potential with significant differentiating features and **currently the market is not pricing in this potential growth.**

VIAC is unique in operating one of four broadcast networks in the United States. This market position enables broad distribution and large/well-diversified audience demographics. While ""cord-cutting"" is a key structural challenge, this business generates cash that can be deployed into growth businesses. **Secondly, the return of the theatrical business will serve as another source of both content and cash generation for VIAC as they continue to reposition their portfolio around streaming.**

***Non-core assets***

Non-core assets being sold is another potential source of significant cash. Some would be sale of CBS' headquarter building (\~$1bn), Simon & Schuster (sold for $2.2bn, expected to close in 2021), and CNET $500mn. **All combined this could potentially raise $3.0-3.5bn in cash.**

# 2. Death of a beached whale

As you all probably know by now, our boy Billy Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks.

By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu.

Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns, but not the actual ownership, of the stock.

By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out. On Monday, March 22, ViacomCBS announced plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal that generated $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans (a very preudent decision by management considering the stock price at the time). Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares. But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. Below are the main points of what happened after:

1. Archegos  was hit with a margin call.
2. Archegos  defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund
3. The  total value of equity exposure was around $20bn
4. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total      return swap
5. Banks were forced to sell their position in large block trades

**3.** **Value Opportunity With Incredible Risk/Reward Asymmetry**

A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world""

\- Seth Klarman, from his book ""Margin of Safety""

The opportunity to buy companies with a significant margin of safety is rare in our current stock market environment. However, ViacomCBS presents a unique value opportunity with the stock down over 58% over a one-month period with no material change in the underlying fundamentals of the company.

VIAC reported solid results in the recent Q4-2020 quarter.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2wdq9phowsw61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=1729c4fd605a6eabc47e6f426d76194e658eb07f

While the whole focus is on transitioning the company to streaming, the company is doing it from a position of strength. Yes, the whole playbook revolved around the streaming subscribers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ox9ig5qwsw61.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f548399ec1815dfcbe31780f6ca792daf9953be

But VIAC was able to generate that growth while also generating tons of free cash flow.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bzhzoohrwsw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=eede156fcffbce3d1f04fa516e7b724e2636964f

VIAC also repurchased shares at a great price in 2020 and of course used the spike to reissue at a higher price. The proceeds will be used to further bolster Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Netflix achieved its success because of multi-billion-dollar investments in original content, which is a testament to the strong positive correlation between spending on content and subscriber growth. For Paramount+ and Pluto TV to achieve the expected success, ViacomCBS will have to invest substantial amounts in producing high-quality original content and also on securing broadcast rights to live sports events, and it makes sense for the company to raise funds when there is an opportunity in the market. The company has already announced a massive content investment goal through 2024.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s8qi8m8swsw61.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d42e29734a3745b1598343388bd0f063ab92cfd

Streaming is one of the most competitive, yet fast-growing business segments in the world today. A closer look at recent developments in the industry reveals the presence of a loyal follower base for a brand will not lead to immediate success in the OTT industry. For instance, Apple is struggling to gain market share in the OTT streaming industry although it has a wide follower base and a second-to-none brand value. In contrast, The Walt Disney Company has seen unimaginable success with Disney+. The differentiator is the expertise in content creation and the availability of marketing channels to take the streaming service in front of consumers who are likely to subscribe to a premium subscription service.

ViacomCBS is one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the world, and the company owns some of the most widely followed TV shows and networks. For example, MTV is considered a leading media brand that interacts with the younger population and has a reach of 450 million households in 180 countries. Nickelodeon is another media asset owned by ViacomCBS which has a massive reach. These media assets, the brand value associated with these networks, and the past success of the company in creating content that attracted millions of viewers, will all play an important role in the success story of Paramount+ and Pluto TV.

In 2020, Pluto TV, the ad-supported streaming television service, reported 43 million monthly active users, and I believe MAUs will continue to grow at a stellar pace in the next five years.

&#x200B;

[  Global Pluto TV MAUs](https://preview.redd.it/na560vmtwsw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b5511fc46880a1046f93209e3b0576874bde7fe)

One of the major hurdles to success faced by the subscription-based OTT content streaming industry in emerging markets is the unwillingness of many consumers to pay a monthly fee to watch premium content. This has a lot to do with the median income levels as well. Because of this characteristic, the illegal pirate video services industry continues to thrive in high-growth regions such as Brazil, India, and many other Asian and Latin American nations. According to a recent study by Mint, India's OTT industry loses up to 30% of revenue to pirate video service providers. Pluto TV is primed for growth in international markets because of its ad-supported model as a result of the favorable demographics for this industry in emerging markets, which will be a catalyst for ViacomCBS's growth in the coming years.

Considering the growth opportunities available in the streaming industry, I believe the company management is correct in raising funds to meet the content investment requirements. As the streaming services gain traction, I am confident of a significant expansion in valuation multiples similar to what happened with Disney stock. As long as Disney remained a traditional media company, the company's shares traded at reasonable valuation multiples. However, the decision to restructure the business last October in a bid to prioritize Disney+ sent the stock soaring to new highs because of the positive sentiment of investors toward the OTT streaming industry. In the coming months, I expect a similar expansion in valuation multiples for ViacomCBS stock as well, along with the steady progress the company is expected to make in prioritizing the direct-to-consumer business.

A little over a year after Viacom and CBS merged, the company showcased an aggressive streaming strategy that includes relaunching CBS All Access as Paramount Plus on March 4, with a content pipeline that combines live sports, breaking news and a massive movie library as well as original films and series for the platform. The company also plans to leverage Pluto TV as a way to attract viewers to Paramount Plus.

“When it comes to streaming, we stand for something unique – an ecosystem of free, pay and premium streaming, underpinned in pay by the new Paramount Plus service,” said CEO Bob Bakish\*\*, adding that ViacomCBS nearly tripled its global streaming subscriber base and more than doubled its streaming subscription revenue over the past two years\*\*. “It’s a streaming service that will resonate with broad and diverse audiences and has a robust slate of originals which will only grow.”

The company had a stronger-than-expected Q4, due in large part to the shift to streaming. The company reached a milestone with global streaming subscribers reaching nearly 30 million across its streaming platforms which include CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and BET Plus\*\*. Domestic streaming subscribers was up 71% to 19.2 million YoY.\*\*

Meanwhile, Pluto TV – which Viacom acquired in early 2019 for $340 million – clinched 43 million global monthly active users and 30.1 million domestic MAUs. **Pluto TV also closed new global distribution agreements with Samsung and Google.**

**Global streaming and digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888 million in Q4, driven by 74% growth in streaming subscription revenue and 69% streaming advertising revenue growth.**

**Total revenue increased 3% YoY to $6.8 billion in Q4 and the company took in $1.08 billion in operating income. Advertising revenue increased 4% YoY to $3.1 billion in the quarter, mainly due to the growth of streaming and political advertising in Q4.**

Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra said ViacomCBS ended 2020 with $2.6 billion in global streaming subscription and advertising revenue – **with an annual run rate of $3.6 billion – exceeding the company’s expectations.** He added that ViacomCBS has a goal of reaching 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers – mainly through Paramount Plus – and more than $7 billion in streaming revenue by 2024.

**The new service includes more than 30,000 TV episodes and films such as “The Godfather” and “The Brady Bunch” as well as content from CBS, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and the Smithsonian Channel.**

**Paramount Plus will also debut original movies, series and documentaries, and ViacomCBS is investing aggressively in content to support the growth of its streaming services. ViacomCBS invested $15 billion on content last year, and streaming content expenses will increase to at least $5 billion by 2024**.

“We came up with the pricing strategy because we wanted to serve the greatest addressable audience – which we thing the two tiers does,” said Tom Ryan, president and CEO of streaming at ViacomCBS, who also co-founded Pluto TV. “Also, the two-tiers allow us to drive both subscription and advertising revenue. The $4.99 tier gives us greater flexibility in how we go to market with distribution partners.”

That lower tier still has a lot more content than CBS All Access had. The $9.99 plan has no ads and also has more live sports – including NFL football, the UEFA Champions League, PGA Tour and more – and breaking news, **both of which the execs said is rare in streaming.**

“Right now, we think those are the best price points to go to market with and they’re clearly very competitive in each of their respective lanes,” Ryan said.

Unlike HBO Max, which announced in December that it would release its slate of films simultaneously in theaters and streaming, ViacomCBS said it is committed to the theatrical experience, though the typical 90-day window before a theatrical release is available to buy or rent will be much shorter. **Major films such as “A Quiet Place Part 2” and “Mission Impossible 7” will be available on Paramount Plus 45 days after hitting theaters.**

The company also remains committed to free ad-supported TV. **Pluto TV is on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business and is the top free ad-supported streaming service in the United States with the largest distribution footprint in AVOD.** By the end of 2024, Pluto TV is expected to have between 100 million and 120 million monthly active users globally.

“Pluto TV hasn’t just proven our skeptics wrong, we pioneered a new category and now we’re one of the free leading television services,” Ryan said. “Our ad partners love Pluto because we offer the best of both worlds – the efficient targeting of digital with the brand building and storytelling of traditional TV.”

Pluto TV helps create a “super funnel” that expands the company’s paid services, Ryan said, in part by featuring pilot episodes or past seasons of a show before a new season airs.

**“Once they’re hooked, we offer a trial subscription for more,” he said. “With Pluto’s free linear experience, we can effortlessly introduce tens of millions of viewers to the amazing content we’ve highlighted.”**

**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**

**Paramount+ launch:** After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.

**June pricing change:** In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.

**Improving original content slate:** As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.

**Improving advertising trends:** As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.

**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**

Note also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers, **beating Disney+, Hulu and Netflix.**

Also, according to this [article](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/viac-stock-worth-21-percent-more-using-free-cash-flow/) by InvestorPlace:

“Last year, ViacomCBS made $1.891 billion in free cash flow (FCF), according to the company’s earnings release. However, that included a large negative FCF result of -$453 million for Q4 2020. That implies that the FCF for the first 9 months of 2020 was $2.344 billion.

This is why I believe that the Q1 2021 results will show a huge turnaround in FCF. The same thing happened last year.

Back in Q1 2020, FCF was $305 million, a turnaround from Q4 2019 when it was at -$629 million. Fiscal year 2019 ended up with a positive FCF of $826 million, despite the hit during the fourth quarter.

So, this must be a seasonal thing about negative FCF during Q4. In fact, looking at the numbers for Q4 2020 even more closely, it included a total of $388 million in one-time losses on sales of assets. That would have come close to covering most of the -$453 million in FCF during Q4 2020. **This is another reason why I believe that Q1 will show a major turnaround in free cash flow**.”

**Recent Price Targets for VIAC:** Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70

**My 100K position (all in):**

**TL;DR: VIAC is severely undervalued and could present a fantastic turn around play for 2021. Buy LEAPS or shares.**

&#x200B;

Not financial or investment advice. Just my opinion. I eat crayons for breakfast. Yada, yada, yada..

Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...”

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

n3zybm,,wallstreetbets,post,1620058112,"Why I’m bullish on MVISSo, let me get this straight. We criticized MVIS for having a “large” 2b market cap and so now we all suddenly support Nokia with a market cap of 25.1b? That’s 12x more than MVIS. 

NOK Income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 13,659,000/21,852,000 = 62.5%. This means 62.5% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 37.5% is what the company kept as gross profit. 

MVIS income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 
1,398/3090 = 45.24%. This means 45.24% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 54.76% is what the company kept as gross profit.

All prices listed from income statements are in millions of dollars. Yes Nokia is bringing home more money, but they aren’t raking it in as efficiently as MVIS. Because MVIS is a much much smaller company than NOK, their differences in the dollar amount of gross profit is to be understood. But my original statement still stands, MVIS is “taking home a bigger % of their pie” for profits, because they are better than NOK at mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs. 

Let’s take a look at their D./T.A. Ratio. This will give us insight to which degree debt is used to finance assets for each company. The lower the ratio, the better the company is at using that debt to finance assets.

NOK DTA: 6,486,000/36,191,000 = 17.92%. This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, NOK accumulated $17.92 in debt. 

MVIS DTA: 3,107/21,006 = 14.79% This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, MVIS accumulated $14.79 in debt. 

MVIS does a much better job, as previously stated, at mitigating losses and staying efficient. Not to mention, because MVIS is researching extremely new technology, much of their funding will be for R&D - much more R&D is needed for sensors that didn’t exist a few years ago, over the R&D needed for a new phone or cellular service which has already been around for decades. If MVIS is able to have a lower DTA ratio, developing “new to this world” technology, than a company that has been making phones longer than we’ve been alive, then how is it a bad buy? How is NOK a better buy?

I know typically DDs are not suppose to take into account the comparison between other stocks, but too many of you have fallen into this NOK train that will leave you at a $4.50+ cost basis, and suddenly NOK will start trading sideways at $4.10 for the next coming years, and you’re nah holding. Have fun making 3 cents a share per year. That’s pussy shit I didn’t come here for. 

Not financial advice, I literally failed Finance 304. Professor was an ass.",,,,,,,,
n3zybm,gwst2eg,wallstreetbets,comment,1620059533,"MVIS is a company that could be reasonable expected to have 0 revenue in the next quarter.

Being “bullish” on a company doesn’t mean “just find some other shitty company to compare it to.”  MVIS has no products. It expects to make just over $3M total from its licensing agreement with MSFT this year that everyone got so excited about, all of that cash is already on the balance sheet against a liability. This quarter they recognized $479k of revenue and reduced their liabilities by that amount, meaning they got zero actual cash inflow. They put themselves Up for sale a year ago with the stock sub $1 and now people think someone’s going to buy them for $10b? This company is a joke.

&#x200B;

Get clover health ($CLOV) …. Why you ask?

&#x200B;

Lets break it down:

This was a Chamath SPAC at $10 … and then went to $17…. Okay good stuff.

Then some shit short selling report from Hidenburg research came out accusing them of some bad practices and a DOJ investigation.  That shit was overhyped and short sellers jumped on that and started shorting…. They shorted it down to about 7 bucks, that was a hella bargain price to get in it. Lots of companies get summoned to provide information by the DOJ, its really not a big deal, but was overhyped.

Now this company is legit.  Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurer that combines technology and preventive care to lower costs and increase the quality of life. 

&#x200B;

\- They have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive.

\- Biden and democrats are looking to lower the medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.

\- Short interest is above 35% … so yes possible squeeze potential too.

\- Board of directors has got Chelsea Clinton on it, and she is obviously tight with the democratic party. 

\- They moved earnings up…. Which is usually a good sign.

\- There are 360k calls expiring on May 21, and earnings are a couple days before on May 17th. (only 56k puts, so the call to put ratio is pretty damn high)

&#x200B;

This has got some real potential to double by earnings, maybe even more.

 I got in a bit late and bought high, dont be me and get in early on monday!

Position: 4531 shares at $10.72 - and (16) May 21st, $11 call options. Link to position proof.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

One thing I've seen a trend on is mega cap names for the past few quarters having a big run into earnings.   


$DIS is set to report earnings on May 14th, it recently was sitting at $203 / share and dropped back down to $182 last week...around this time I started to buy, a lot of calls and some shares. I favored calls for this to give myself more leverage because I was highly confident that Disney would run in the next few weeks. I think with the parks opening up and the momentum of Disney + this has a chance to get back over $200 before earnings.   


Now what I've seen with many of the other mega caps, if they rip into earnings...and sometimes really rip in the AH. But the next day they just dropp off a cliff. My plan here is to hold calls until we get closer to the earnings date, sell those and buy more shares.

Last year they attained a temporary one-time exemption from UN sanctions to export wine into South Korea \[1\]. The supply ended up in countries all around South East Asia, mostly Singapore \[2\], however I can't find any examples of it being imported to or sold in North America.

Given the limited supply, national scarcity of an object difficult to transport internationally, eventual historical significance and precedent for overpriced alcohol, how safe of a bet would it be and how much returns could be earned per year, if one where to import a pallet of North Korean wine into North America and hold for a decade or two? Does anyone have any examples of prices of Nazi wine to help project the eventual value of North Korean Wine?

As far as I'm aware taking advantage of this one-time exchange may be our only opportunity to purchase North Korean wine without breaking international trade sanctions.

n30u1l,,wallstreetbets,post,1619937822,"Why I think the market will see a 30-50% correction by SeptemberI'm not going to give you a wall of text that you will probably skim through, instead I'd like to show you 4 graphs that I've studied at length which I feel depict my thesis in shortest amount of time then provide brief explanations

**Thesis-** The stock market is at an unsustainable high valuation and when tracking historical times of similar booms we see a sharp pullback in the years following a squeeze of like magnitude. High speculation coupled with total uncertainty in rate tapering timing will lead to a 30+% correction in the summer of 2021. Retail spending will be at ATH, supply shortages will be at ATH, and inflation levels will spike to 2009-2010 levels.

**Graph #1 - Bank Of America Global Research Sell Side Indicator**\*(this charts buy and sell signals based on 15year averages)\*

[Currently we are less than one point from a sell indication(blue line nearing red line). In history, corrections occur directly following a sell signal call.](https://preview.redd.it/ydij4ihjfmw61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=f611bea4713da9a7257ba2708dd8a0e9b595960e)

**Graph #2 - VIX/VXV**\*( the VIX is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days, the lesser know VXV measures implied volatility three months out. One way to look at fear/greed is to use the VIX divided by the VXV: VIX/VXV ratio )\*

[The current VIX/VXV ratio sits at 0.754. When the rate is about this low, vertical blue lines, returns for the S&P500 are often less than stellar. Namely, in 2012 the S&P500 lost 10-14% eventually. In 2015 the index stalled almost a year, adding a mere 3.5%, only to lose nearly 15%. Similarly, in 2016, albeit the pullback was shallow (-5%). In 2017 there were several <0.75 readings, and the market ignored those, gaining almost 20% since the first reading in August 2020 but losing at least 6% since the last <0.75 reading from December 2020. Besides, less low readings, like in 2018 and 2019, can still lead to 20% losses.](https://preview.redd.it/wt3l6uw7imw61.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&s=10d9ec18390ed9a56dfd4908687db964456e330f)

**Graph #3 - Fibonacci Retracement** *(Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate the possible locations of support and resistance levels. It shows how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The direction of the previous trend is likely to continue. However, the price of the asset usually retraces to one of the ratios listed above before that happens. )*

[The white lines are the resistance levels at 8 month intervals. The 5th sequence of the cycle usually results in the further move to the downside. Following this trend, the 5th wave would happen between july and september 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/u2kxm0abjmw61.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=f99b4385974681a7d962fa060f3789f94808a0ef)

**Graph #4- VIX Bollinger Bands** *( Bollinger Bands are curves drawn in and around the price structure usually consisting of a moving average (the middle band), an upper band, and a lower band that answer the question as to whether prices are high or low on a relative basis.* *The narrow bands suggest a period of low volatility. Widening bands suggest an increase in volatility often associated with a trending market environment )*

[In the graph, we see the VIX(Tracks options volatility) at two time periods: 2008 Recession & Present Day. In 2008 we saw the VIX fall through 2009 and into early 2010 as the economy was bailed out. Bollinger bands leveled out at peak separation from top and bottom bands which led to a market sell off shortly after, further lengthening the economic recovery. Following this trend we are in the same cycle as post 2008 recovery, with the markets speculation growing towards a potential catalyst in the form of an interest, tax or wage rate hike.](https://preview.redd.it/mgqaw23ckmw61.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f3bb372d06e78930b81efa8e1f2ba5067f546f)

**CONCLUSION**: History shows us there is cycles to our financial nature as human beings, analysis shows us the cycle end is nearing. Overvaluation, abundance of cash, and supply restrictions will ultimately lead to a correction in anticipation of coming inflation.

**PREDICTIONS** Federal reserve begins slowing asset purchasing in June and overvalued mid and small cap stocks will sell off to offset heavy weighted holdings( lowers taxes with realized losses), by July 4th news reports on lay offs from material shortages will begin, July and August will be red, and September-December will be a recovery back to 200 day moving averages.

I would continue listing but for timing purposes I'll stop there

# Dotcom bubble Vs. Current bubble

The NYSE advance has peaked and is now declining, even though the S&P and Dow continue higher or have went flat. This indicates that while the selective market indexes are moving higher, the broader market is struggling. Characteristically, our current financial markets fit the same picture as 1998-2002.

In 1998 the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in order to reduce the chances of an economic slowdown due to material and labor shortages. After this, money flooded the market resulting in the overvaluation of many equities and dotcom runup we saw prior to the bubble.  -  (*We can relate this to coronavirus stimulus and subsequent interest rate reduction)*

In the fall of 1999, with the market at ATH, the U.S. shrugged off the emerging-market crisis and the collapse of a large hedge fund(sound familiar?), the Fed reversed course and raised rates three times in 1999.  - (*We can relate this to the current market state, with many investors believing the market cannot go down, Bill Hwangs hedge fund seemingly brushed off, and federal reserve stating interest rates will be increased in the future.)*

Following this, in 2000 financial institutions informed their clients the tech stock were no longer undervalued and the dotcom bubble selloff began. - (*This is where I think we are heading this summer into 2022.)*

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

To be clear, the outcome of the near term market relies heavily on how retail investors perceive current market conditions.  Its my belief that once the general public has enough pressure on the federal administration to fully reopen the economy then tapering will be announced, lenders will raise rates and hedging will begin... triggering the sell off.

($SONY *formerly SNE*)

Given the GME interest, here is an investment idea.  Sony makes & sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple). Sony makes & sells the most sought after gaming machine - demand will likely exceed supply all year (at least). They're also into VR (and make & supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets & viewfinders).

Sony has a well established music & movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.

Sony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills & cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars & other machinery (ahem MVIS).

In addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).

* GoPro's subscription side of their business had 55% QoQ and 145% YoY growth rates.
* GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model.
* The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly (consumer electronics, photographic equipment, and action camera's)
* GoPro's main competition is DJI, Akaso, and Garmin (especially in the action camera market)

**Investment Plan:**

* Buy between $10-14 and hold long-term (until it reaches fair value)
* Sell if the stock falls below $10.49
* Look for re-entry at $8.80-$9.20 (if stock falls below $10.49 and you sell)

**Stocks Fair Value:**

Using a DCF (as seen in the analysis below), GoPro has an estimated share value of $39.12, this implies a potential upside of 248.35%. 

If you  follow my advice above there is only a 6.59% downside risk before selling and re-entry, this makes the risk-to-reward of my trading strategy very favourable.

# Analysis

**Company Overview:**

GoPro manufactures and sells cameras, drones, and other filming/photography accessories. Their main products consist of the HERO7, HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras, and a MAX 360-degree waterproof camera. The HERO 9 camera is the best-selling camera in the US digital market. GoPro also offers cloud-based storage solutions that enables customers to access, edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro’s cameras. GoPro also offers camera protection plans (GoPro Care) and video editing applications (Quik).

GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors/distributors, as well as through their own e-commerce store. GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014, and since its IPO has fallen by over 31%.

GoPro has a TTM revenue of $891.9M, a TTM EBITDA of -$22.6M and a market cap of 1.719B. Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N/A, putting a value on this company is difficult.

Recently, GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this. GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer (DTC) approach in their business model, this has led them to scale back on spending, sales and marketing expenditures, and office space. Furthermore, the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition. This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future.

Investment Information:

**Company and Financial Information:**

GoPro has 3.2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms. This exposure can be leveraged to market their products, and gain product awareness at a significant discount. Furthermore, they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made.

GoPro’s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52% QoQ, and 145% YOY. This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company.

GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021, these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model, increase the DTC component of their business, and grow their gross margins from 36% to 38-40%.

GoPro has 771,000 subscribers to their subscription service, charging an annual fee of $49.99. This amounts to their subscription service bringing in $38.54M last year.

Furthermore, GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package.

GoPro’s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be $68M at FYE 2020. This results in a 24.57x EBITDA multiple, this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report.

**Industry Information:**

GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market, which is valued at $1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7% between 2020-2026. By 2026 (incorporating current industry trends) the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at $1.5T, with 70% of the market being from audio and visual segments, both of which are segments of GoPro’s business.

Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at $22B and is expected to grow at a 5.78% CAGR for the next 6 years. This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Samsung, however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly, giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry.

Lastly, GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3.5B and is expected to grow at a 14% CAGR until 2026. By this time, the industry is expected to be valued at $5.5B.

By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within, we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to determine the fair value share price.

**Competition:**

DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras. Recently, they have launched their very first action camera, the Osmo Action, which is supposed to compete with GoPro’s HERO7. The Osmo Action has a front-facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7.

Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures. Recently, they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro. The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro, however it comes in at a cheaper price point, and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro.

Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation, automotive, marine, outdoor and sport activities. Garmin’s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera, is similar to many GoPro models, shooting video in up to 4K, with similar size and weight to that of GoPro. The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and altimeter, which may be attractive for some consumers.

**Investment Plan and Valuation:**

Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA, we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company. Instead, we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share.

Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of $39.12. The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on, and if GoPro’s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries.

With that being said, the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience. By looking at their current management and their backgrounds, it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years, and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience. This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro, I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future.

For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro. If you can buy the shares in the $10-14 range, you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return. If you buy at current prices $11.23, I recommend holding unless the stock falls below $10.49, if this happened, I would sell and look for a re-entry at $8.80-9.20, then hold long term.

**Basic Overview of BNGO, Bionano Genomics**

Being the only major player in the optical genome mapping space, Bionano has revolutionized genomics by detecting large structural variations in genomes by reducing the cost per genome, time of operation, and increasing the detection rate while providing a relatively simple platform to work from, rendering the esoteric nature of operating LRS and NGS for large structural variation detection obsolete in many ways.

Their *saphyr* system allows researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for **new diagnostics and therapeutic targets**. “*Large structural variations are responsible for many diseases and conditions*, **including cancers and developmental disorders**. Optical genome mapping with Saphyr detects structural variations ranging from 500 bp to megabase pairs in length and offers assembly and discovery algorithms that far outperform sequencing-based technologies in sensitivity.”

Their next-generation genome mapping and analysis tools **help researchers see true genome structure to fill in what’s missing from sequencing-based data**. Saphyr, their high-speed, high-throughput whole-genome mapping solution, offers unmatched structural variation discovery capabilities and the ability to construct the most complete genome assemblies.

The Saphyr® System by Bionano Genomics is a genome imaging tool for high-speed, high-throughput **structural variant detection** and analysis with exceptional sensitivity and specificity.

**📷**

**TLDF:**

They analyze genomes and produce maps which enable researchers to find information that could be crucial for helping drug enhancements, preventive care, cures, susceptibility awareness and more.

***ApE LaNgUAgE-***

Saphyr finds some things in genomes more efficiently than traditional technologies. So yes, it is cool and we may moon but not primarily because of this.

1. Financials 2021 Revenue Projections, Profitability, Cash Runway

(video format on channel) **-**

Recent History of Revenue

**2020-$8,503,000**

**2019-$10,130,000**

**2018-$12,001,000**

**2017-$9,505,000**

**Avg=$10,034,750**

**Things that are likely to cause increased revenue (total revenue) in 2021**

1. Lineagen acquisition  

   1. BNGO acquired them in August 2020, with **only 5 months** of work in an increased regulatory environment (covid), they brought in **$1.5M in revenue**.  

      1. 1.5M×2 (12 months in year, double amount from 5 months, add a small bit more because 2021 is likely to have less covid restrictions, also of course extra 2 months of revenue {CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATING EXTRA 2 MONTHS AND ADDED REVENUE FROM LESS COVID STIFLES})=3M+200,000 from extra 2 months and less covid restriction benefits

$13,234,750

1. Benefit of cash=new opportunities  

   1. Unlike all years past, Bionano now has **cash for marketing**, more acquisitions, r&d, and plenty of catalysts to look forward to including **saphyr 2.0/higher throughput**, **saphyr’s use in prenatal & postnatal screening**, more saphyr sales, and cytogenetic space. CFO Chris Stewart said that Bionano believes its cash stockpile ""significantly de-risks the company, solidifies our financial future, and allows us to focus on the achievement of our long-term vision to disrupt genomics through the global adoption of Saphyr.""  

      1. 13,234,750+1,500,000=

$14,734,750

1. More recognition=more recognition (domino effect, kinda)  

   1. As more and more labs and universities adopt and approve saphyrs capability and efficiency (like african genetic lab just a week ish ago), others will do the same. It will be similar to how crypt0 got and is getting more recognition from the mainstream as more places adopt it. Bionano has never had interest like it is now nor has it ever had the exposure/popularity it currently has and they will continue to gain and (imo) capitalize on the added attention.

   2. “The company plans a commercial release of prenatal assays and an expansion of the menu of its pediatric assays in Q3.”
   3. “The fourth quarter of 2021 will be an especially busy one. Bionano anticipates the validation of three of its laboratory-developed tests with billing codes. It also expects to have a prototype of its next-generation high-throughput Saphyr system ready.”
   4. “If all goes according to plan, Bionano will finish this year with a much larger installed base. The company projects that it will have 150 systems installed by the end of Q4 2021 -- a 50% jump from the end of 2020.”

BNGO 2021 Revenue Projection-

[**2021 Analyst Projection**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-bngo/bionano-genomics#future) **- $16,337,000**

**Auspicious Projection - $**21,234,750

(I am not even factoring in the UK or Africa ((which by the way, are both likely to start numerous Saphyr adoptions in a chain of research institutions imo)) Saphyr adoptions to be extra conservative)

Contrarian points (probably bear’s objections to the above\^)

* Lockdowns don’t decrease work efficiency or revenue because people just work from home--
* Analysts know more than retail investors typically so if they are only projecting 16M, why should yours have any more likelihood of actually being right?
* Shouldn't smart money/whales have already priced some of your points into the current SP?
* What is your track record when it comes to revenue projections and why should we believe anything you say?

cant link youtube vids so thx wsb lol ahah, debunking is on teh channel ""Auspicious dissenT"" the '2021 bngo rev. projections)(no disrespect, just jk) - (17:40)

**Some orthodox important points**

**according to** [**simply wall st.**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-bngo/bionano-genomics)

* Revenue (47.7% per year) is forecast to grow faster than the US market (9.7% per year).
* Forecast to remain unprofitable over the next 3 years.
* Relatively [slow EPS growth](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-bngo/bionano-genomics#valuation) (Positive by 2025).
* Short term assets ($46.8M) exceed its short term liabilities ($8.9M).
* Short term assets ($46.8M) exceed its long term liabilities ($16.4M).
* Debt of 16.3M (relatively low)
* sufficient cash runway for more than a year based on its current free cash flow.
* less than a year of cash runway if free cash flow continues to reduce at historical rates of 16.4% each year

According to [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/25/buy-these-3-stocks-to-cash-in-on-the-genomics-revo/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20BioNano%27s%20product%20is%20a%20key%20tool%20in,%28also%20known%20as%20amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis%2C%20or%20ALS%29.)

* Its equipment needs a constant supply of kits for customers to get the data they crave. So its revenue has a significant recurring component which will grow with time as it develops more and more options for applications

My Extrapolation-

With revenue expected to grow between 100% and 150% YOY and a historical stable decrease in cost of revenue we can *expect* a much higher EPS & revenue growth than simply wall st. analysts have projected. However if [operating expenses continue to keep rising](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/financials?p=BNGO) then we could see a revenue and EPS growth similar to that of the analysts projections (not necessarily though if revenue keeps increasing at the current pace, a pace which is not possible to be kept perpetually, but I believe it could be prolonged for at least few years if things go Bionano’s way)

TLDF:

There is an extremely high chance that revenue will grow more than 100% YOY and a high chance of getting closer to 130%-150% growth given the above.

ApE lAnGuaGE

money will grow much faster than what analysts are predicting resulting in bngo go moon and bionanians portfolio’s go brrrr

2. Markets

& Potential Markets, TAM, SAM, SOM and Future TAM, SAM & SOM

(basically listing all revenue sources and likely future sources)

1. Genetic Labs  

   1. Universities, R&D companies, hospitals, scientific institutions, unorthodox educational facilities (more in the ***future*** section), nonprofit hospital system (ex. - [Mayo Clinic](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-adopts-bionano-saphyr-for-applications-in-neurodegenerative-diseases-2019))
   2. Cytogenetics  

      1. “$500 million to $600 million from selling Saphyr to cytogenetics labs for diagnostic purposes, along with annual recurring revenues of $200 million to $400 million. There are over 2,500 such labs around the world, the company estimated.” - [INVESTORPLACE](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/)
      2. TAM of cytogenetics according to CEO in ER call is around 3B, which he said was attributed to all genetic labs essentially, *but* there are many more markets that increase the TAM (not necessarily the SOM, but nonetheless the bigger the TAM, the higher ((probably)) the SOB in the long run and in the aggregate based on my anecdotal non-scientific opinion) significantly.
2. NIPT  

   1. Susceptibility of diseases, proclivity for this sickness or that one, offers the individual a chance to take action to mitigate an increased risk for them *at a young age*, the benefits of this are not researched heavily (obvious reasons) but one can assume that it could be absolutely revolutionizing for health quality, life expectancy & wellness.
   2. WIDE range of various crucial information NIPT can discover (OGM *could* disrupt this industry and/or provide enhancements to the technology capabilities of LRS and NGS)
3. PostNatal Screening  

   1. Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS later this year and next year for solid tumors. - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma9f0t/bngo_bionano_genomics_dd_the_future_of_genomics/)
4. Autism  

   1. CEO, “The wide spectrum of genetic variation between individuals with ASD makes it difficult for traditional tests to provide a diagnosis of the genetic condition. We expect OGM with Saphyr to reveal a more complete picture of genomic variants that provides actionable information that can potentially improve outcomes.” - [source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152632/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Publishes-Study-on-Autism-Risk-Genes-After-Detailed-Analysis-of-The-Genome-of-Professor-Temple-Grandin-Who-Has-Brought-Awareness-to-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Throug.html)
   2. The company has [already made breakthroughs](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152632/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Publishes-Study-on-Autism-Risk-Genes-After-Detailed-Analysis-of-The-Genome-of-Professor-Temple-Grandin-Who-Has-Brought-Awareness-to-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Throug.html) in the space, it is my belief that the [flywheel effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_effect#:~:text=The%20flywheel%20effect%20is%20the%20continuation%20of%20oscillations,such%20oscillations%20are%20said%20to%20be%20flywheeling%20.) *could* come into play here
   3. OGM is a relatively new space, given that it essentially only has one real company devoting its time to it (see ***competitors*** and ***history*** section for more info on OGM competition & other companies), it may be likely that as researchers become more experienced, the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) will play an important role.
   4. Understanding a whole genome and how it replicates may give us a rudimentary knowledge of how they develop and how to stop it (possible cures, preventatives, mitigations-$$$)  

      1. About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 59 births. More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder.
5. Neurodegenerative Diseases - Alzheimer's, ALS & Possibly Others  

   1. “Dr. Ebbert uses long-read sequencing and Bionano whole-genome imaging because it can identify large structural mutations that cause disease. Many individuals who have neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and ALS do not have a known genetic cause, and studies to date have focused on short-read sequencing, overlooking disease-causing structural mutations. Bionano’s Saphyr provides the potential of long-read sequencing now.” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-adopts-bionano-saphyr-for-applications-in-neurodegenerative-diseases-2019)
   2. More than 3 million Alzheimers cases per year in US  

      1. Around 20,000 ALS cases per year in US - [source](https://www.westernslopenow.com/news/local-news/keenan-van-goes-to-the-11th-als-patient/)
6. Leukemia  

   1. “Dr. Alexander Hoischen reported the results of a successful validation study comparing the performance of Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr® system to traditional cytogenetic methods for the clinical analysis of leukemia genomes. The study, published in bioRxiv, found that Saphyr was 100% concordant with the standard of care for the detection of somatic chromosomal abnormalities.” - [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bionano-genome-imaging-concordant-traditional-130010495.html)
   2. “We are positively surprised by the smooth and fast implementation of the Saphyr system in our laboratory. Less than a year after training we now have successfully run more than 150 samples, including the 48 leukemia samples which we now present in this publication. Other samples include novel research findings for unsolved rare disease cases and known cytogenetic abnormalities which may validate the Saphyr system’s use for constitutional aberrations.” - Dr. Alexander Hoischen
   3. “Breakthrough Findings in Leukemias Presented at ASH 2019 Demonstrate Bionano Saphyr’s Potential to Replace All Cytogenetic Methods and Show Additional Clinical Utility” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/breakthrough-findings-in-leukemias-presented-at-ash-2019-demonstrate-bionano-saphyrs)  

      1. About 61,090 new cases of leukemia and about 23,660 deaths from leukemia - [source](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/about/key-statistics.html)
7. ***Cancer*** (has its whole section devoted to it)
8. Miscellaneous, Other  

   1. According to [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bionano%3A-prenatal-testing-offers-another-opportunity-for-saphyr-says-analyst-2021-04-09), Kevin DeGeeter’s positive outlook for the company is partly based on Saphyr’s potential to impact other markets beyond cytogenetics for hematologic malignancies. Ones where the use of microarrays, FSH and karyotyping also “results in long and expensive analytical decision trees.”
   2. Correcting and discovering genetic abnormalities
   3. Aids for medicines discovered by analyzing whole genomes of diseases that we are oblivious to currently
9. Uses [According to Bionano Themselves](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf)  

   1. Undiagnosed Genetic Disorders
   2. Hematologic Malignancies
   3. Gene Discovery and Therapy
   4. Cell Line Stability
   5. Solid Tumor Research
   6. Genetic Engineering Studies
   7. Evolutionary Biology
   8. Reference Genome Assembly
10. IVF/Infertility aids - [#1](https://bionanogenomics.com/bionano-university/articles/bionano-detects-balanced-translocations-in-patients-suffering-from-infertility/) [#2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32026199/) [#3](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/bionanos-uk-deal-is-huge-for-bngo-stock/) (this one is more ‘potential market’ than market)
11. “The authors not only illustrated that the Bionano Saphyr system was a useful and rapid tool for refining the translocation breakpoints to the gene level, they also addressed the potential application of selecting embryos for infertile patients receiving IVF based on Bionano analysis”.
12. “The SMOM (“used on the Bionano platform”) has potential clinical application as a rapid tool to screen patients with BRTs for underlying genetic causes of infertility and other diseases”.
13. “Additionally, one of the labs “will also evaluate Saphyr for the detection of structural variants (SVs) in patients with developmental delay, infertility, rare disease, and other genetic diseases.”
14. (((BONUS)))
15. Just a reminder that analyzing saphyr’s data requires other products that are not cheap and these do not last forever, this means recurring purchasing will be periodically happening (+ saphyr 2.0, all customers who wish to have the 1400x higher throughput Saphyr will need to purchase that).

**Some orthodox important points**

**according to an INVESTORPLACE article**

* TAM - $2.6 billion to $3.8 billion according to [company estimates from prior to March 12](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/). **(based on below point, the author of** [**this same article**](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/) **actually means** [**SOM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market#Difference_between_TAM,_SAM_and_SOM)**,** ***if the below point according to the same article is true,*** **‘because the CEO believes they could realistically achieve 2.6-2.9B yearly’)**
* Over 7,000 research labs in the world. Holmlin claimed that Bionano could generate $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion by selling Saphyr to those labs and another $500 million to $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenues.
* The company is conducting 22 clinical tests of the platform in four main areas, prenatal, postnatal, blood cancers, and solid tumors. Based on this data, payors can decide to reimburse the company’s customers for their use of Saphyr.
* Lineagen provides services that cytogenetics labs find attractive, including genetic counseling, certified tests, certified coders, and a large patient database.
* ***Some*** diseases Saphyr has produced new information are ALS, Alzheimer’s, liver cancer, leukemia, and epilepsy.

TLDF:

Given the *plethora of breakthroughs* they have already made and the **learning curve** and **flywheel effect**, I think it is *likely* that many if not all of the potential markets will be penetrated soon and down the line.

4. Saphyr Deep Dive

(How it Works), Advantages, Disadvantages

1. Optical genome mapping using Saphyr® reveals what’s missing in your research. Rapidly identify genome variation like never before with the high-throughput Saphyr system. - [Details](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf)

Advantages & A Bit on How it Works

1. The cost of PACB’s method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method. And much faster. (It should be noted that although the Saphyr can seemingly detect all that NGS & LRS can but at a lower cost, it is not actually the full case. Basically, saphyr can detect certain parts at a higher efficiency but not everything. Most NGS & LRS provide higher-resolution base-level nucleotide information. Saphyr’s map provides a structural map, and does not directly identify the chemistry comprising the structure. Very roughly like if you assay a house, the optical map would be great for showing you the shapes of the foundation, wall and roof framing, but it wouldn't tell you the materials. For similar esoteric information ((intro to ogm & how saphyr works, what it does)) that will help in illuminating the basic process of OGM in action vs. LRS or NGS, these two sources might be good starting places. [#1](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf) [#2](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+youtueb&docid=608026313887146892&mid=0E68F17FBBC6CB9D42B30E68F17FBBC6CB9D42B3&view=detail&FORM=VIRE)).
2. Higher detection rate of large svs than NGS & LRS
3. Cheaper
4. Easier to use and not as esoteric
5. Less false positives
6. Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that structural variations can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome, and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility. - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation)
7. “The system comes with a screen, keyboard, a processor, and a server and costs \~$150 thousand. Besides the system sale and installation revenue, BNGO receives recurring income from consumables like pigments and reagents. Similar to a printer and ink cartilage, this business model creates a regular income stream for BNGO.” - [source](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/), [source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410239-bionano-genomics-second-chance)

Disadvantages

1. “BNGO... plans to seek an FDA clearance for Saphyr medical use. The delay is due to the high costs of obtaining the license, stemming from lengthy clinical trials and robust requirements. It is worth reminding that the commercial launch of Saphyr is only recent, and the company has been operating as a publicly traded company for a small number of years. The addressable market of BNGO will increase significantly in the event of an FDA approval.” - [source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410239-bionano-genomics-second-chance) (whether this is true or not in the ‘FDA Approval section’)
2. Cannot detect all of what NGS & LRS does
3. Somewhat high cost, although relatively it is cheap when factoring in alternatives because there really are no true alternatives that replicate what the Saphyr does.

For more basic information on how the saphyr works you could watch these [#1](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=608023006763444898&mid=19A3E7A04639BDAA25A119A3E7A04639BDAA25A1&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) [#2](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=608010697387433297&mid=68C7A6CA1AE8D6F8662768C7A6CA1AE8D6F86627&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) [#3](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=607988153116227555&mid=A29766594B704CEEECBBA29766594B704CEEECBB&view=detail&FORM=VIRE).

TLDF:

Saphyr has very auspicious advantages with innovation left to come as built-in obsolescence proponent’s idea in regards to the Saphyr is completely nullified with their ongoing updates and enhancements (I don’t know anyone who doubts the Saphyr in this way, but I’m sure there are some). Recurring revenue with their market strategy is a nice benefit as well and the disadvantages of Saphyr are nothing compared to its current benefits and future innovations.

5. FDA Approval

1. Saphyr does not [necessarily need FDA approval](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lco5kt/the_following_bngo_saphyr_post_is_only_intended/).  

   1. Saphyr is already in *full* use in hospitals, labs, clinics, universities and more.
2. [Pacbio does not have it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/kvp1dp/the_fda_argument_for_why_ark_wouldnt_invest_in/) and it is one of Ark’s largest holdings.
3. Although FDA approval for the Saphyr may generate more interest and hype for the stock, it likely would not instigate huge moves to the stock price.  

   1. Or as Saphyr gets FDA (if) approval, Ark pulls the trigger, that could happen although personally I think Ark is sophisticated enough to realize that what determines Bionano’s success will not be the FDA approval for a box (Saphyr’s shape resembles a box)

TLDF:

FDA Approval will not make or break the stock, if anything it would boost interest and little else. Bionano can easily do all the things bulls want it to without FDA approval although they would welcome it if it did happen as some institutions may warm up to the Saphyr a bit more in that circumstance.

6. Cancer

I have been saying since before January and February that cancer could be the one thing that makes this stock turn us into millionaires. And although the stock price has gotten beat down, my synthesis for an entire market in cancer solution enhancements/mitigations has only been more legitimized.

Several articles and Bionano themselves alluding to Saphyr being able to ***possibly*** help develop cancer mitigations - cures, chemotherapeutic drug enhancements. A more thorough understanding of how cancer cells replicate and spread so fast provides the *opportunity* to find what stops them. I think the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) will play a huge role into Saphyr’s findings in cancer related research especially as they have not been working on cancer research very long.

1. “On April 22, Bionano announced that a group of scientists, using Saphyr and other tools, had developed a technique that is “capable of determining the timing, speed and origin of DNA replication in human cells at a coverage level that is thousands of times higher than what earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing allowed.” Errors in “DNA replication” may result in cancer, “many chemotherapeutic drugs target and disrupt DNA replication,” Bionano stated. As a result, better comprehending DNA replication can aid scientists in developing cancer treatments with reduced side effects, the company believes.” - [source](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/bionanos-uk-deal-is-huge-for-bngo-stock/)
2. “Cancer samples are just too complex for low coverage whole genome sequencing. Complex rearrangements, tumor heterogeneity and unsequenceable repetitive regions of the genome present additional challenges for short and long read sequencing technologies.” [source](https://bionanogenomics.com/research/cancer/#:~:text=Bionano%20Genome%20Imaging%20provides%20cancer%20genomics%20through%20a,genomes%20in%20heterogeneous%20samples%20revealing%20large%20structural%20variations.)
3. “Professor Vanessa Hayes at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research published a complete tumor-normal comparison from a primary prostate cancer.5 Her team identified 85 large somatic deletions and insertions, of which half directly impact potentially oncogenic genes or regions. Only one-tenth of these large SVs were detected using high-coverage short-read NGS and bioinformatics analyses using a combination of the best SV calling algorithms for NGS data. A manual inspection of NGS reads corresponding with the Bionano derived target regions verified 94% of the total SVs called with Bionano mapping. Many SVs detected with Bionano were flanked by repetitive sequences, making them all but invisible to short-read sequencing.” - [source ](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04",,,,,,,,
Bionano-Genomics-Next-Generation-Cytogenetics-Resolves-Structural-Variants-in-Cancer_White-Paper_A.pdf)(page 4),,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. “Bionano Genomics (BNGO) new study is likely to lead to a new level of cancer research and drug discovery with reduced side effects, demonstrating the importance of optical genome mapping (OGM) in a large research market. Notably, the study is led by Dr. Nicholas Rhind from the University of Massachusetts Medical School along with a global team of scientists from France, Canada, and the US. DNA replication is a fundamental process of cell growth seen in cancer and was not easy to study in human genomes. Through Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr-based method, the timing, speed, and origin of DNA replication will be known in human cells at a coverage level, which is thousands of times higher than earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing. The body of humans and other organisms develops and grows when cells divide, and for each division, the entire genome needs to be replicated, the company said. Erroneous DNA replication might result in genome instability and mutations driving cancer. Therefore, as cancer cells divide excessively, many chemotherapeutic drugs target and disrupt DNA replication.” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bionano-genomics-publishes-new-study-on-dna-replication-shares-gain-in-pre-market-2021-04)

If BNGO discovers new groundbreaking advancements in cancer research then stock price go boom portfolio go brr and bears go hibernate. This seems at least somewhat likely in my mind given all of what they have done so far and considering the learning curve and flywheel effect. Curing cancer is not what we are talking about here, however that may not be out of the range of possibilities down the line, we are emphasizing Saphyr’s proclivity for discovering vital information that could lead to more breakthroughs in mitigating cancer growth and risk. Preventive care, susceptibility, enhancements in chemotherapeutic drugs are all things that Saphyr could certainly help with inventing. If any of this does happen, BNGO GO MOON.,,,,,,,,

In this post, I will outline:

1. Why we haven't seen inflation in the past 40 years
2. Why we are going to see inflation now
3. What to do about it

*\*Disclaimer: This post contains only my own opinions. I've strived to be as accurate as possible with the information below, but some information may be inaccurate or outdated. I am not a financial advisor or an investment advisor, and this is not financial advice. Please do your own research before investing your own money.\**

Since the crisis of the 1970's, inflation has been near-absent from developed economies. Almost every financial professional who traded through the 1970's inflationary period is now retired. Since humans always doubt the applicability of times they haven't lived through, society has grown complacent.

**Why we haven't seen inflation in the past 40 years**

Since the 1970's, we have seen two massive deflationary forces:

1. The outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to developing countries, especially China
2. The importation of unskilled labor for agricultural and service sector jobs that couldn't be outsourced.

To understand the incredible deflationary impact these forces have had, imagine a world in which the United States of today manufactures its own goods, and sends back anyone living in the country who is descended from undocumented immigrants (disclaimer: this is not a world I want to see, this is just for the purposes of a thought experiment). Now imagine how much a cheeseburger or an IPhone would cost in that world. It wouldn't be difficult to imagine a $20 McDonald's burger or $8,000 IPhone. Of course, wages would also be much higher in this world, since there would be a much higher demand for US labor.

By visualizing this, you can begin to understand that the impact of our monetary policy over the past 40 years has been *dramatically* inflationary, with this inflationary pressure only being offset by trade and immigration policies that should have lowered the cost of goods and services by 5-10x. This is why, on balance, prices have stayed relatively stable during our lifetimes. In fact, while prices have risen modestly during this time period, the increase in labor supply due to outsourcing and immigration has actually put a massive downwards pressure on the wages of unskilled laborers in the US since 1970:

[US unskilled labor wages actually decreased since 1970](https://preview.redd.it/4z4ieaozdqw61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cc63cfaffbdd85a609dc3b6144f7e5bdbf50cd)

**Why we are going to see inflation now**

The problem with the trends outlined above is that the deflationary trends have already reached their near-maximal levels. Concerning immigration, undocumented workers already make up 50%-70% of the agricultural workforce [\[1\]](https://www.fb.org/issues/immigration-reform/agriculture-labor-reform/economic-impact-of-immigration). Foreign-born workers make up 20% of the *entire* low-wage labor force of the US [\[2\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/forbrn.pdf):

[Percentage of US workers that are foreign-born, by industry](https://preview.redd.it/brcy6aa79qw61.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=af0715c21249f8ba0742542f399d214c7b8a4095)

Concerning manufacturing, the US imports \~$2.1T of manufactured goods each year [\[3\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/imports-of-manufactured-goods). In comparison, the US's total GDP from manufacturing is only \~$2.2T [\[4\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-from-manufacturing). Taking into account that some of the goods the US manufactures are exported, that means that more than 50% of all manufactured goods for sale in the US were made in other countries.

&#x200B;

[Source: thebalance.com](https://preview.redd.it/dnn8isnkdqw61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef710b492bb0cfadb6e09cfd977f3de23f0de7c6)

When we account for the fact that some goods are too expensive to ship overseas, and the fact that the US has recently realized that having some domestic manufacturing capacity is crucial for national defense, the percentage of manufactured goods that the US imports is likely near its maximum sustainable level already.

On top of this, as developing countries industrialize and become wealthier, their labor rates are naturally rising, putting upwards pressure on the price of imported goods:

[Manufacturing labor costs per hour for China, Vietnam, Mexico from 2016 to 2020](https://preview.redd.it/4b6m8bdffqw61.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aba0db5e2bd43f63527ecd91d6c3c7477c4ab4e)

All of this together means that the United States can no longer mask its inflationary monetary policies with deflationary trade and immigration policies.

Now, enter the pandemic. The massive monetary and fiscal stimulus employed by the US government in 2020 and 2021 greatly increased the number of dollars in circulation, but added nothing to the productive capacity of the United States. The average productivity of a US worker has not grown substantially from 2019 levels. Yet in that time, the S&P 500 has gained 50% in value. A glut of money has flooded the system, leading to the ""everything bubble."" In addition, the US government owes \~$27T, and thus has a *massive* incentive to devalue the US dollar. The only way the government can stay solvent is to continue its inflationary, low interest rate policies.

Inflation is coming.

**What to do about it**

First, understand that while the Fed wants you to believe inflation will be temporary, in actuality, inflation is a self-perpetuating cycle. Investors see that the US dollar is losing purchasing power, so they dump the US dollar in favor of physical assets and foreign currencies. This further devalues the US dollar, causing even more fear amongst investors, leading even more people to dump the US dollar for physical assets and foreign currencies. This is why the Fed worries so much about ""inflation expectations."" As long as no one believes inflation is here (it is), the system won't spiral out of control. Unfortunately, in a free market, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool everyone forever.

Now, personally, I do not believe we will see true hyperinflation (defined as prices rising more than 50% month-to-month). Instead, I believe we'll see what I'll call ""runaway inflation."" This is a return to the **\~8-10% yearly inflation rates** we saw during parts of the 1970's.

In such an environment, we should expect to see a few things:

1. Nominal interest rates will rise, but the Fed will strive to keep real rates low or negative
2. P/E compression on stocks
3. Investors will rush to physical assets

By keeping real rates low, the Fed ensures that the US government remains solvent. Stock market P/E ratios will compress, since higher nominal rates will increase the discount rate used to value future cash flows.

Here's a list of some assets ranked by how they would likely perform in such a situation, from worst to best:

1. Bonds (including Treasuries)
2. Stocks
3. Real Estate
4. Gold

For the rest of this section, I will focus on gold for three reasons:

1. It's historically performed the best during inflation.
2. It's a pure inflation play.
3. You can buy call options directly on gold.

**Gold**

Gold increased in value by **14x** during the inflationary 1970's:

[Gold price during the 1970's](https://preview.redd.it/b7wqgc49kqw61.png?width=2334&format=png&auto=webp&s=22947b7178e65a581e47c79fbbb341a8b9c5e1c5)

Adjusted for inflation, this is still an increase of **717%** in a single decade. Since 1980, gold has fallen out of favor with most investors. This pessimism has set the stage for a massive rally in gold prices over the coming decade.

**How to value gold**

The problem with gold is that, since it is not an asset that generates cash flows, it's difficult for people to agree on how to value it.

There are essentially 3 different ways to value gold:

1. As a commodity
2. As an asset class
3. As a currency

In the analysis below, keep in mind that in 1980, one troy ounce of gold was worth **$668**, and it is now worth **$1769**

**Valuing gold as a commodity**

Since 1980, commodity prices have risen by **2.54x**:

[PPI for all commodities](https://preview.redd.it/sirmxwhblqw61.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2472c79d44d7125edf8805e8d526e482d03077f)

If gold rose by the same percentage, this would imply a current price of **$1696** for gold. This represents a **4% drop** from the current price. We will use this as the floor for gold, as I believe it is unlikely we will see a drop substantially below this price. Keep in mind that, if we expect commodity inflation to average 10% over the next decade, this would still imply a **$4398** price target for gold by 2030

**Valuing gold as an asset class**

Gold is more than just a commodity. It's an established asset class that has been in use for thousands of years. How should we value an asset class? Well, investors tend to allocate a fixed percentage of their portfolio to a given asset class. For example, investors nearing retirement will typically allocate their portfolio 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds, and will rebalance this portfolio when stocks or bonds change in price.

What percentage should we expect investors to allocate to gold if inflation returns in the coming years? In the middle ages, gold and silver represented essentially the entirety of the world's financial assets. In modern times, however, before the removal of the gold standard, gold seems to have constituted about 5% of the value of the world's financial assets. In fact, this was remarkably stable up until 1960:

[Gold as percentage of global financial assets, from 1960-2015](https://preview.redd.it/7iyd80imnqw61.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7f3453cf4e8a0cc30ac2a77ebcfa630d6cad5b)

We can see that, despite the world coming off the gold standard in 1980, gold remained 2.5% of global financial assets by 1980. After 1980, low inflation rates convinced investors that fiat currency was viable, and pushed gold down to a low of only 0.2% of financial assets during the dot-com bubble.

I believe that, if and when runaway inflation rears its ugly head again, prudent investors will allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to pure inflation hedges, such as commodities and precious metals. I believe it's reasonable to assume that of this, 2.5% of the portfolio will be allocated to gold, as it was in the 1980's.

If everyone allocated, on average, 2.5% of their portfolio to gold, the price of gold would jump to **\~$8980** today. After 10 years of 10% inflation, gold would reach **\~$23,290** by 2030.

Thus, valuing gold as an asset class, and assuming an allocation percentage that is half of the pre-fiat-currency historical average, we could expect a **1,200%** increase in the price of gold over the next decade.

**Valuing gold as a currency**

The third and final way to think about gold's value is as an alternative currency to the US dollar. Gold has historically been held by central banks as a universal currency, to protect these banks against exchange rate risks. 

In order to value gold as an alternative currency, I will look at how many dollars there were in the past, how many ounces of gold there were in the past, and then assume that there should be a fixed ratio between the total value of all US dollars and the total value of all ounces of gold over time.

There are currently **187,000** metrics tonnes of gold sitting above ground (and only about 57, 000 metric tonnes discovered left to be mined) [\[5\]](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news_science_products=0#). Each year, about 1% of this is mined [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_gold#/media/File:World_Gold_Production_1900-2014.png). Extrapolating backwards, we can estimate that there were **\~75,000** metric tonnes above ground in 1930.

Today, there are **$2.15 trillion** US dollars in circulation. In 1930, there were **$4.4 billion**.

In 1930, there were thus **$59,000** US dollars in existence for every metric ton of gold in existence. Today, there are **$11,497,326** US dollars in existence for every metric ton of gold in existence. Thus, valued as a currency, the price of gold should have risen: 11,497,326 / 59,000 = **194.85 times.**

In 1930, gold was worth $20.69 per troy ounce. Using the ratio derived above, today, gold should be worth: $20.69 \* 194.85 = **$4,031** per ounce. Assuming a 10% inflation rate for the next decade, gold would reach **$10,455** per ounce by 2030.

**Doing better than gold: The beauty of modern finance**

Now that we've seen that gold is potentially massively undervalued by historical standards, the question becomes, how can we maximally profit from this information? After all, we don't just want to preserve purchasing power, we want to actually create wealth. 

Luckily, we have access to something today that medieval peasants did not: call options on gold, priced in nominal dollars.

Since call options are priced in nominal dollars, runaway inflation makes nearly all call options appear desirable. This is especially true of an asset with low implied volatility, such as gold. For the purpose of the rest of this section, I will be examining **$GLD**, the world's largest physically-backed gold ETF.

I've chosen gold and **$GLD** rather than silver and **$SLV** for two reasons:

1. $GLD options have much lower IV than $SLV options, at \~16% versus \~32%. Thus, with $SLV you're paying roughly twice as much for your inflation bet.
2. $GLD is backed by physical gold

To figure out what we could expect to make from $GLD LEAPs, let's summarize the results of our three ways to value gold analyzed above, assuming additionally a 10% annual inflation rate for the next two years and using that assumption to predict Jan 2023 $GLD prices:

&#x200B;

* Priced as a commodity:
   * May 2021 predicted value: $1696 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $1987 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$186**
* Priced as an asset class:
   * May 2021 predicted value: $8980 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $10,524 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$986**
* Priced as a currency:
   * May 2021 predicted value: $4,031
   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $4,724
   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$442**

&#x200B;

Using an options profit calculator [\[7\]](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html), we can then determine which Jan 2023 options would be most profitable in each scenario:

&#x200B;

* Priced as a commodity:
   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $150.00 Call**
   * Expected nominal return: 56.7%
   * Expected real return: **39.5%**
* Priced as an asset class:
   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $350.00 Call**
   * Expected nominal return: 82,497.4%
   * Expected real return: **82,480.2%**
* Priced as a currency:
   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $320.00 Call**
   * Expected nominal return: 12,608.3%
   * Expected real return: **12,591.1%**

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

It's possible to not only survive runaway inflation, but to profit massively. If gold ends up being valued the way it was historically, as an asset class or a currency, there's a potential for a **100-800x** return through $GLD options. Even valuing gold as a commodity, $GLD options have good potential upside. Thanks for listening WSB ✌️

n3w73k,,wallstreetbets,post,1620048910,"Time for you apes to grow your first wrinkle. Why I think a cucked generation of millenials will blow RKT's ER on May 5th to UranusAlright, time for some grown-up DD. I've been busy with a side project I think folks here will like so haven't been posting too much but ya'll need to learn this.

**What drives stock price?**

Same thing as to why completely average girls on Twitch give you a boner. You had low expectations, and reality was somehow a little bit better

And what's the expectation for RKT right now? Pretty low

Mainstream news has been spitting the same fear, uncertainty, and doubt every week. Rising interest rates = less housing demand. And analysts have been expecting an EPS based on a hypothetical rate increase that the Fed constantly re-iterates will not happen until 2023 your goddamn CPI inflation basket of milk, eggs, and dildos be damned.

BUT. I believe RKT's Q1 ER on Wed, May 5th will be better than expected. And given the low volume these days, any surge in volume could cause some crazy spike.

**What makes you so confident?**

(1) Look at this chart of housing supply from Redfin. We are at an all-time low for active homes for sale in the US. Normally this would be worrying since it might mean less supply = less mortgages but...

[Source: https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/us-housing-market](https://preview.redd.it/luusztbl8vw61.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=09da688b17fa7ce9a26993de0c11c48d83d53671)

(2) Newly listed homes are on pace and trending like every year before it. So that means houses are still getting listed as usual, but every house that gets listed immediately gets gobbled up by buyers

[That dip in 2020 was due to COVID](https://preview.redd.it/atm8lsbl8vw61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8bbf8afb44906ae9f3ee75712c2e633b803aa2)

(3) This is further evidenced by OFFICIAL [CENSUS.GOV](https://CENSUS.GOV) data that house buying is currently at an all-time-fucking-high

[Source: https:\/\/www.census.gov\/construction\/nrs\/pdf\/newressales.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/t0jsqep07vw61.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=55507ff8b3a649bd65834ab05fae7e61527e4e7e)

**But what about the future?**

True retards here are all too familiar with buying FDs for ERs only to become confused beggars when all the numbers beat but it still crashes. That's because ERs are never about past performance, but about future guidance.

""Yeah, and since this 2020-2021 mortgage/refinance craze is just a temporary thing due to COVID, the future is bleak for RKT!"" I hear an overpaid hedge fund intern with 3 MBAs exclaim like Archimedes shouting ""Eureka!"" down the street naked

That's where I also think RKT and the market will surprise us.

I strongly believe there is an entire generation of cuckolded millenials who are finally buying houses after years of pursuing ""experiences"" and ""living with friends"" in ""the big city where there are real jobs that require but don't require my college degree"" which is causing a bottleneck / zerg rush to the rest of the country all buying houses at once.

Just fucking look at these top 10 fastest growing metros from Redfin. Fucking BOISE IDAHO? These scream to me as ""I tried to make something of my life in my 20s in the city but never got anywhere and now I'm in my 30s/40s and give up and need to adult and this is the only place I could afford something so I can feel like I achieved something"". Accelerated by COVID.

RKT is the second-largest lender for FHA and VA loans, of which I also suspect many of these are.

**What else?**

For folks new to the mouth-gaping awe that is Rocket Companies' bulgy thick-veined protruding member, here's a quick rundown:

* **Profitable** \- For the full-year of 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/#:~:text=For%20the%20full%2Dyear%20of,up%20a%20record%2Dsetting%20year))
* **Special dividend** \- RKT issued a special dividend of $1.11, roughly 4.5%, only 7 months after IPO on 3/8/2021. That's a ballsy move and shows they got money to spare
* **Buyback** \- RKT also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program back on 11/10/2020 ([source](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2020/11/10/quicken-loans-rocket-companies-third-quarter-profits-buyback/6239432002/)). We don't know when or if it's been deployed yet, but again it shows an insane amount of confidence in your cash flow to do something only 3 months after IPO
* **Advertising** \- RKT has also started investing heavily in sponsorships and advertising, again to appeal to millenials. They sponsored the [Super Bowl](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2021/01/07/rocket-mortgage-super-bowl-squares-sweepstakes-returns-for-super-bowl-lv-after-awarding-1-75-million-in-last-years-big-game/) with a contest and commercials, an [Indy 500](https://racer.com/2021/04/01/paretta-lands-rocket-pro-tpo-backing-for-indy-500/) car, and also sponsored the [100 Thieves League of Legends Training Room](https://youtu.be/h4SMSCKOXO8?t=59) for some fucking reason. I think they're just flexing at this point
* **Auto** \- It also looks like RKT has launched early access to their Rocket Auto platform ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/mz14jr/rkt_auto_looks_like_rkt_has_launched_early_access/)). Credit to [u/amru\_ons](https://www.reddit.com/user/amru_ons/) for the find. Carvana is currently worth 49.16B which is MORE than RKT at 44.55B which boggles my mind.

**What do the naysayers say?**

* **I thought RKT mostly did refinances?** I don't believe RKT has ever disclosed exactly what % of their revenue comes from refinances vs mortgages but regardless, the refinance boom has armed the company with tons of cash to transition the company into the Amazon of loans aka the next great FinTech company
* **Why has the stock been pinned flat ever since IPO?** Honestly, I don't know. Some people speculate not enough float and that Dan Gilbert owns \~92% so banks are crushing the stock to screw him but I don't really follow that logic.
* **Wat about mah short squeeze?!?!** Sadly, I do believe the squeeze has already been squoze and sadly it was only a 1-day affair. Short interest was at \~45% going into March 1st spike but now is only 7.56%. But the good news is that this can finally rise naturally like so many IPO companies do 6-9 months after IPO

**Positions or ban**

Still got my 73,652.485 share of RKT all in. I re-invested all my dividends via DRIP that's why there's the awkward fractional shares I can't figure out how to get rid of which breaks the UI. The average cost is $24.12 and current price is overflowed by the UI.

[My fractional shares broke the shitty TD Ameritrade UI](https://preview.redd.it/uqslmda97vw61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84cdd0e04b1e8ca4cdcd0012436029d9eec82b6c)

For further proof of my diamond hands, here's the graph showing my hold from $1.7M up to $3M back down to $1.66M now.

[Remember: 8 digits or bust](https://preview.redd.it/1vwgais97vw61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4583346a3cc087529f2230b8b394c28df4efed2b)

n3bjnh,,wallstreetbets,post,1619977105,"CLOV - Some Option InformationHere’s something interesting to consider from a more technical options standpoint: right now there is unusually high open interest in CLOV calls (a significant portion being out of the money). These calls are often written by market makers, who need to hedge their short calls by purchasing stock. As you know, gamma squeezes occur as the stock rises and more of these call options go in the money and the whales buy up stock to hedge their risk. Here is another part of the puzzle many people are missing: the amount of stock they buy to hedge is often related to the delta of the option (so they can remain delta neutral). Hence, the higher the delta of a contract, the more shares the market maker needs to buy in order to hedge the risk. Here’s another fact: vanna (the second order Greek, measuring delta sensitivity with respect to implied volatility) is (typically) positive. This means that if implied volatility goes up, delta will go up, and market makers will have to purchase more shares to remain market neutral. Now here’s the kicker: as earnings approach, implied volatility will usually, particularly in shorter term contracts, skyrocket. Couple this with the fact that the May 21 expiration is very close to earnings, deltas across the board will quite possibly rise substantially in the days before earnings, forcing market makers to buy up huge chunks of stock to hedge, and hence potentially driving up the price by a tremendous deal.

This is all speculation. I cannot stress enough that there is no guarantee that this is the case. This theory could fail for a number of reasons: these calls may simply be retail investors who aren’t bound by any delta neutral strategies or anything of the sort; the stock may drop before earnings and hence the increase in implied volatility could fail to offset the change in underlying's effect on delta; the market makers simply buy the calls back at a premium from paper-handed option buyers, taking a loss; or there is sufficient downward pressure/selling momentum at the time that the market makers could simply buy a lot of stock without drastically increasing the price. That's why I need to say: please please please only invest if you genuinely believe in the stock and can afford to lose whatever you put in. The stock market is risky business - nothing is guaranteed and you can always lose a lot of money if you make poor decisions. In fact, you can lose a lot of money even if you make really good decisions and the market turns against you.

(This is not financial advice - please do your own due diligence and only risk capital you can actually afford to lose. I myself have invested about 10k in LEAPs, short term options, and then another few thousand in shares.)",,,,,,,,

so ive been looking at $HAE  for a while this company makes plasma collecting machinery and other technologies related to blood collection as well as software for managing the machinery and collection data. Recently the stock dropped almost 50% due to losing a client (CLS  pharma) since they are trying to make their own products witouth the need for plasma. I should addd that plasma collection is not limited to use CLS pharma is ussign it gfor (crating medication), so even if CLS found a new way to create their product it wouldnt affect palsma market too much ( there is a lot more usage in other areas).

This client represented 12% of their revenue (also the contract only ends by the end of 2022), plasma business seems to be on an upswing as countries start to open up more and more plasma collection is seen as less of risk.

My question is dont you guys think this stock dropped far more than its worth, my DD is fairly limited but seems like  a good bet.

n40avv,,wallstreetbets,post,1620058943,"HIG quick adderall DDHARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC

This stock has recently jumped from $54 to $68 in April, and I am expecting a similar play. 

The MACD oscillator has been bullish since the start of this year. 

- Price target of $76-$93. (I am personally aiming for $85-93)

- The charts have demonstrated a good ability for further gains. 

- Two buyout offers which valued the company at nearly $25 billion were rejected. 

- Insurance companies are currently benefiting from the pandemic, as most lines of business have a lower amount of overall claims being filed. 

- The insurance industry is currently increasing premiums and re-evaluating underwriting standards in order to limit losses. 

- HIG's mutual fund business grew as a result of the rebound in the market following the CARES stimulus package. 

As mentioned the insurance industry is generally benefiting from the pandemic. As many people are staying at home people are naturally doing less driving, and therefore have a lower chance of getting into an accident. This has resulted in better combined ratio's for HIG's auto insurance unit. 

Workers compensation claims have also been lower than pre-pandemic, as less people are present in the workplace hence natrually there will be lower claims. Conversely with businesses re-opening, we can expect new insurance policies being taken out with HIG. 

As travellers insurance is also genreally rising in rates. With lockdown easing and vaccination rates, travel is expected to increase. I expect this to be a positive impact on the traveler's insurance unit of HIG. 

Overall:

The recent large spike has reflected HIG's high quality and growth prospects into the current valuation, and with the new policies being taken out with the pandemic easing and the companies good adjustment to the pandemic itself, I expect another rise in share price.",['HIG'],,,,,,,

But more importantly, CLOV is currently priced under $10. I'm hearing many people claim it will be more than double this come the next earnings report on May 17th.

For some quick background - CLOV, or Clover Health Investments, is a healthcare technology company that has been on the rise for quite some time now. They've been increasing their member count substantially and each member has pulled in more profit for the company as time moves forward.

Right now I think that the company is OVERWHELMINGLY UNDERVALUED.

This is not just a 'potential meme' stock, but it is definitely a long-term growth stock with investors in mind.

Right now the company is approaching $10 per share with a prior peak at ~$17.07 back in December, and a low of around ~$7.29 in March (for reference).

The stock appears to hang around the $10 mark generally, but search traffic has been increasing (checked using google trends) and I'm hearing a lot of talk with the next earnings report. Combine this with a higher volatility, this leads me to believe CLOV might be my lucky stock of choice that will bring me to paradise 🏖️

I'm trying to start a mini-discussion here of the potential of CLOV as both a long-term and short-term investment. I think I like the stonk 🍀🍀🍀🍀

I didn't know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I'm excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to.

With that being said, I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point. My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap-up or gap-down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation. I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated ""bottom"", the entire theory will be invalidated. I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together. Anyways, let's get right to what I think about Friday's (4/30/21) price action.

# Brief Summary:

As of 4/30/21, CLOV opened at $9.89 and closed at $9.85 with a previous closing price of $10.17 (-3.15%). To simply put it, today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price. The volume didn't help with the stock's bullish sentiment either as Friday's volume was at 17.38 mil in contrast to Thursday's volume at 68.33 mil. This means Friday's volume was cut down by more than -74.5%; that's 3/4 of Thursday's total volume, gone for today. Now, I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began:

* Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown.
* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.
   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting ""dumped on"" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.

**Fibonacci retracements:**

With Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Friday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.

**VWAP:**

Today, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**

Based on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.

**RSI:**

This is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high.

**Short Volume:**

Let's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?

It's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4/19 to 4/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are ""dumping"" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.

That being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!

**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**

**Disclaimer:** This is not a financial advice. I'm simply a fellow ape who just likes the company. Invest at your own risk and most importantly, do your own personal due diligence to ensure that the facts are true.

First you take advantage of the historically booming mortgage market and low interest rates by taking out as many mortgages as you can afford through a mortage brokers tied to a public traded stock (RKT for example).  Then using the houses that you now own you take out additional loans which you use the proceeds to wheel (sell calls/puts) into gold/silver/platinum.  As you keep gathering more premium and your house values goes up slowly (while interest rates mostly stay stagnant as the feds are afraid of crashing the market) you take out more loans and sell more puts.  Hopefully by the time the housing market crashes your wheeling account will have accumulated enough in value to pay off its mortagages on it own through wheeling.  Since gold and other commodities tend to go up during market/housing crashes during the downturn you will be able to pay off your mortagages through the gains you will see in your wheeling account.  If housing keeps booming you keep getting more loans out (or sell/pay them off to reduce risk and realize gains).  At some point later on you can sell your housing for nice gains or refinance and take our more mortgages.  If things go sideways your wheeling premiums will keep you afloat, while you slowly whittle away at your mortagages.

The way I see it is your houses you buy is almost like buying a LEAP call so you can sell options covered.

The last time UWMC announced earnings was February 2. Back then, the IV was \~100% (Chart Below)

https://preview.redd.it/we9ni67u8qw61.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=f698a5cec4403c859879b027a2d242420fbbd39f

As we approach earnings announcement, the IV should increase to \~100% again.  Now Vega--the greek that measures stock jiggle--for 05/21 9C is about 0.007. Multiply Vega by expected increase in IV (0.007 \* 25 = 0.175). So the option price is expected to increase by 0.175 in the run up to earnings.  Current price is 0.33 at the moment. Potential 53% return.   


Positions: None, market's closed. Buying on Monday.   


TL;DR:   


1. Buy 05/21 9C now
2. Sell 05/21 9C May 10 or risk getting IV crushed.

1) Highest efficacy against the original Covid-19 strain (~96%)
- Pfizer: 95%
- Moderna: 94%
- J&J: 72%
- AstraZeneca: 62%
- CanSino: 65%
- Sinopharm: 79%
- Sinovac: 50%
- Sputnik: 91% (questionable)
2) Highest efficacy against the South Africa variant (~60%)
- Novavax: 60%
- J&J: 57%
- AstraZeneca: 10%
- others: horrible
3) The only vaccine with proven efficacy against 3 variants, including the UK variant (86%)
- Novavax’s technology shows excellent cross-protection against drifted strains and mutations
- this aspect of Novavax's technology was recently proven /w its Flu vaccine ...handily beating the market leader: Fluzone
4) Highest single-dose efficacy (83.4%)
5) Highest levels of Antibodies: 600% higher than the next-best vaccine!
- the Novavax vaccine probably will last for about 5 months longer than the next best vaccine
6) The only major Covid vaccine that can easily be made into a multivalent vaccine that contains multiple variants (3-5) in a single dose
- 60-80% less antigen than RNA vaccines
- NanoFlu already has 4 strains of the flu in its dose 
- This may prove to be the most important factor for determining which vaccine is best
- This is the future; Others can't do this
7) Novavax has the highest manufacturing capacity ...slated to be about
- 2B by middle of 2021
- 2.7B by end of 2021
- 3B by early 2022
8) Novavax has ""lowest cost per dose"" (Bill Gates)
9) Novavax has simplicity of manufacturing
- ""the composition of the Novavax makes it arguably the simplest yet to manufacture"" (Al Edwards)
10) Novavax has the most geographically-diversified production
- US, EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, India, and Canada
11) Novavax has the highest quality group of partners
- Not just first place, Novavax ""has taken partnerships to a whole other level""
12) Beats all other manufacturers /w easiest distribution and storage requirements
- 36°F to 46°F ...normal refrigeration
- stores for up to 6 months
13) Best tolerability (% issues)
- Novavax: 40%
- Pfizer: 91%
- Moderna: 90%
- others: less than Novavax
14) Longest durability of protection
15) Developed w/o the use of fetal cell lines (this will become an issue once there is ""choice"" of vaccines)
16) Novavax is very undervalued with tremendous high upside, making it a strong buy.
17) Novavax continues to be largely off the radar for the general public
18) The mainstream media (including most of the financial media) and the market have not yet started to pay attention
19) Analyst Josh Schimmer (Evercore ISI), believes Novavax is the “vaccine to beat”
20) Analysts at B. Riley (Mayank Mamtani) and JP Morgan said Novavax is ""best-in-class""
21) “strong potency and unique tolerability”
22) an extremely large addressable market
23) a market cap of only ~$16B (tiny compared to all other pharma cos)
24) Biotech and pharma companies are normally valued at a price to sales multiple of between 6 and 7 times
25) suffice it to say that a short-term price target of $422 (and a gain of 230%) is being fairly conservative.
26) if the company shows signs that it will achieve its goal of a 2 billion annual capacity run-rate by mid-2021, the price target would rapidly jump higher
27) The target should also go higher as:
- its vaccine receives approvals in various major countries
- it is rolled out and becomes a far larger part of the public's consciousness
- the company should have significant pricing power by having the best vaccine
28) If it's production capacity reaches 3 billion, the rise in the share price may be astronomical.
29) This is not even counting revenues of its flu vaccine, and that it has two blockbuster RSV vaccines far along in its pipeline.
- The combined market for the RSV vaccines is over $5 billion, and there isn't even one RSV vaccine on the market!!
30) the NOVX downside a month ago was about 4 times higher than now. There is still a very large amount of upside.
31) Best risk/reward profile from an investment standpoint
32) UK EU CA NZ AU US MX IN UA ID KR PH CH JP 

These and its many other advantages
1) make it the top vaccine
2) allow Novavax to charge a premium
3) will give Novavax the largest share of the long-term market (as much as 45% of world market)

Novavax clearly gets the title of ""best Covid vaccine stock"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","['PFE', 'PH', 'UA', 'KR']",,,,,,,

Basically BTX was heavily shorted and the share value and low float forced BTX to hyper bounce. As it Hyperbounced, People caught some wind and  did the same play I did. Buy it up ride the spikes enjoy the wins. I called this thing at 5.15 and watched it so closely that I could almost predict when the spike was coming. That being said The short volume ratio is into no mans land. Im not expecting any of you retards to get involved with this however I believe two companies are fighting back and forth almost forcing a similar VW squeeze.

Again im just a retard who is new here, I do my own work and expect nothing else. Sharing my findings and thought.

n3zwqp,,wallstreetbets,post,1620058021,"Meredith Corporation (MDP) Selling Local Media Group to Gray Television (GTN) for $2,7BHi WSB! 

I'm back with another MDP update, my original post about the company is here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsuxmw/meredith\_corporation\_mdp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsuxmw/meredith_corporation_mdp/)

&#x200B;

So, news came out today that $GTN is buying $MDP Local Media Group for 2,7B$. This is huge for MDP shareholders who will receive 14,5$ per share as cash and 1 for 1 new shares for new MDP spin off for National Media Group. For more information [https://ir.meredith.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Meredith-Corporation-Conference-Call/default.aspx](https://ir.meredith.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Meredith-Corporation-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

This Deal practically wipes out MDP debt and gives existing shareholders a one time 14,5$ dividend.

The National media group that will remain under the sticker MDP will have around 2B annual revenue and will make around 300m EBITDA (Closer look at FCF reveals that this 300m is very close to the FCF also), for a company that only has 45m shares outstanding this is absolutely huge. 

We can look at it like this 300/45 = 6,6$ per share annualized cash flow trading at around 33$ as we speak. On top of this there will be a one time compensation of 14,5$ per share giving it a yield of 44% That is insane, this is practically a steal right now.

First of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.

&#x200B;

On the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn’t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn’t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don’t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.

P.S.: Don’t take my word for it and do your own DD.

n2osrx,,wallstreetbets,post,1619895402,"Just what is going on with Vaxart? Up to date with VXRT and why I am betting this stock will potentially climb to higher highs (at least 2x).Edit 3: stock tanked today. Out of nowhere, vaxart released their financials this morning even tho their earnings were not till 5/11. Obviously they incurred a lot of costs due to their research. But also they are delaying their trial phase 2 due to manufacturing issues in their Baltimore plant. All this research.. at what cost…

Edit 2: 2 key dates. This Monday and Tuesday. 
Monday at 12 PM EST - will present updated antibody results (could still be 0 antibodies found) ! from their phase 1 trial (if 0 then stock will crumble else stock will rocket). and position how important T-cells are in vaccines (this is their strength in numbers). 

Tuesday at 5 PM EST - Chief Scientific Officer of Vaxart, Dr. Sean Thomas will present to the world vaccine of congress day 1(!) bullish about it being on day 1,  about holding the needles. They got a pill. 

I do not expect there to be any drastic rug pull on Monday due to their upcoming presentation on Tuesday. 

Edit 1: This post gained some traction. I just want to say this is a straight-up gamble. A: A classic pump and dump by the ceo to raise funds for their research/lab. Or B: They actually have updated results from their phase 1 trial that is promising. Stock is up 100% since last week. The two events/catalysts I listed are priced in. 

However, will we see another >= 50% run-up this week? What factors can contribute to another >50% run-up? 

Answer: We see a disgusting report/results from their phase 1 trial and how their oral covid pill matched up with other competitors in their T-Cell response. Their antibodies results, they're not really showing off. So I would be wary on their antibodies numbers. It is also antibodies from mucosal, which I think is different than the immune system. But from here we see:

 source: [https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1213](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1213) \- mucusal immunity paper 

The mucosal immune system three main functions are to 1) protect the mucous membranes against airbone microbes. 2) to prevent uptake of antigens from aribone matter and 3) prevent development of harmful immune response to these antigens if they reach to the body interior (i.e. past the mucuous system and into the cardiac system, lungs, stomach, digestive/ immune system). 

&#x200B;

I am bullish on their mucosal antibodies: I have a feeling they will show an updated phase 1 trial showing an increase in their results on antibodies of mucosal system. However, will this protect covid itself?

&#x200B;

Answer: 

source: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.611337/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.611337/full) \- mucosal immunity in covid-19

"" The mucosal immune system is the largest component of the entire immune system, having evolved to provide protection at the main sites of infectious threat: the mucosae. "" Covid initially infects the upper respiratory tract. However, it first interactions with the immune system occurs at the mucousal. 

"" Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing now for several months, very little attention has been given to mucosal immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection ""

The research paper then goes on to describe covid and how it may pass through a human's system. And in short they said, "" This means that its interactions with the immune system, during both inductive and effector phases, must first occur predominantly if not exclusively at the respiratory and oral mucosae. "" 

&#x200B;

A bunch of medical terms no idea what 50% of it is saying but it leads me to conclude that covid first starts at the mucousal immune system (through the eyes and nose). And this covid pill from VXRT will present data on mucuousal antibodies from their phase 1 trial.

Summary: n = 20 us citizens 

triggered multiple immune response:

1) T-Cells response to the viral protein, necessary for long-lasting immunity. T cells are a type of white blood cell that have multiple functions. They either stimulate cells to produce antibodies or become memory T cells (this makes immune system register and remember viruses). 

2) T-Cell responded to the viral S protein. From the words of Dr. Thomas, ""V **iral variants with altered S proteins are becoming established in the population before the majority of people can be vaccinated. To end the pandemic, the world needs a vaccine that can provide long-lasting protection from emerging strains ... T-cells can provide long-lasting cross-reactive protection against current and emerging strains of the virus. Our vaccine induced a high percentage of responding CD8+** **T cells against both Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins, which may provide protection against variants with alterations in the faster-changing S protein. We expect that our vaccine will be less impacted by new variants than injectable vaccines,”.** 

Summary: T-cells response in S proteins. Longer lasting immunity and potential less impact by new variants than the needle vaccines.

&#x200B;

3) **No antibodies present on cotton swabs of 2 SUBJECTS. This caused the stock go from $24 to $9.** Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections. They swabbed 2 people out of 20 people. 

&#x200B;

Bull: If antibodies are present in results and in high number, this stock is going to the moon. Also, T-cells relationship with antibodies, what of it that caused them to go to the world vaccine of the doggone congress.

&#x200B;

Answer: When a virus enters a cell.. it gets picked up by our body's surveillance. The MHC Class II molecules circle back to the cell and present the virus to passing cells. This in turn activates the other cells's T Cells. The helper T Cells stimulates B Cells to produce antibodies. The killer T Cells find and kill infected cells with the virus (they are memory cells). So their Terminator Cells. 

Because viruses spread so fast, this process is crucial and needs to be just as fast. T Cells can recognize influenza-infected cells within 1.5 hours.  T-cells also use cytokines as messenger molecules to send chemical instructions to the rest of the immune system to ramp up its response.

&#x200B;

Wait guys, WALL STREET BET of the week: Their FEB TRIAL SHOWED NO ANTIBODIES FROM 2 SUBJECTS. ON MAY THEY WILL PRESENT THEIR T CELLS RESULTS AND THEY KNOW THEY CRUSHED THE COMPETITION ON T CELLS. But what about antibodies? Well.. here's this again: 

"" The Company will also present new mucosal antibody data and review the recent Phase I clinical results that suggest VXA-CoV2-1 is potentially protective against new and emerging COVID-19 strains. ""

A huge shoutout to the stoner guy for posting a Vaxart DD last Thursday getting this onto WSB's attention. Well, I bought some this Friday based on this guy's conviction. Should I buy more this coming Monday? Well say no more, I am onto this DD..

What is Vaxart?

source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-present-world-vaccine-congress-120000069.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-present-world-vaccine-congress-120000069.html)

Vaxart is a clinical biotech company developing oral vaccines. They are designed to be stored at room temperature and offer much more convenience than traditional needles in terms of storage, shipping, and handling. Its current development programs include oral vaccines for COVID, norovirus, seasonal flu, and other respiratory viruses. They have filed a number of domestic and international patents protecting their technology behind these oral vaccines.

Summary: Bio-tech company with a covid pill. Legitimate patents worldwide and domestically.

Question: What made them shoot up 100% in one month?

Answer: Well first, there were two events that were the catalyst for this rise. One catalyst happened in April 26-27. And the second one happened in April 29.

First catalyst: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-120000167.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-120000167.html)

Summary: On April 26th, Vaxart announced it will host a webinar on Monday, May 3rd 12 EST discussing the importance of T-cell responses generated from vaccines and how it can determine if it is effective against prevention. ""  Early reports of vaccine efficacy focused on antibody production, but the ability to engage T-cells may be an important factor in determining which vaccines are most effective. "" Essentially this quote is saying how you know in vaccine development, antibodies are the single most important factor for an immune response to a novel virus entering the immune system. However, this webinar focuses on how T-cells might just be as important as antibodies. Vaxart will bring in T-cell expert Mark Davis, Ph.D., Stanford University School of Medicine, to report on the importance of T-cell immunity in COVID-19 vaccines. And guess what Vaxart will show? ""

So fuckin bullish on this statement alone \^... So that news announcement shot up Vaxart 50%.

&#x200B;

[Vaxart jumped 50&#37; on April 27th due to the first catalyst](https://preview.redd.it/sqxxoj8ozjw61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f10a50d604e55f0d94bd249e61a7301e5844de)

Summary: As if their own webinar T-Cell focused was not enough to present. Vaxart also announced they will present at the **World Vaccine Congress 2021** on May 4-6, 2021\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

[World Vaccine Congress details](https://preview.redd.it/q0dgc5nxzjw61.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9b4363402d1b8dc3f0ce16a05dce44a9ddee9fe)

Dr. Tucker, Vaxart's founder and chief scientific officer, will provide insight into Vaxart's response to addressing Covid-19 with their room-temperature oral vaccine. Guys, this is the World Vaccine Congress, they wouldn't be presenting if they did not have important shit to say.

&#x200B;

Oh fuck I just realized something, if they are presenting this Monday on their T-Cell and antibody results from their trials, they must have great ass news. Because a couple of days later they will be presenting to the world vaccine congress. You wouldn't present a shit project to your co-worker and then present it to the manager a couple of days later right?

&#x200B;

Anyways, I have no idea how to value this stock. All I know is that stonks go up. And this bad boy is sitting at 1.15 bn market cap. VXRT is the only preventative oral vaccine for covid to this date. The Pfizer one is a treatment. There are many countries outside the USA starving for vaccines in the near future as well (ex: India, Japan, some/most of Europe, Canada) and they have the beta AZ vaccine. Let's just see how this oral vaccine will do. This is a casino and I am just rolling some dice with the bros. But in this case, the odds are with us.

Note: I will add more to this post with updated DD and research.

***Revenue Model***

***…***

Their membership acquisition is highly seasonal, with January being the highest enrollment month as a result of Medicare’s annual election period at the end of the year. Their members generally enroll for a full calendar year, creating a highly predictable revenue stream for that year and meaningful opportunities for them to re-enroll members for years to come.

***Member Enrollment***

Their revenue growth rate and long-term profitability are affected by their ability to increase their number of members, which requires that they both continue to enroll new members in their MA plans and retain existing members. Their membership expanded from **42,592** as of December 31, 2019, to **58,056** as of December 31, 2020\*\*, an increase of 15,464 members\*\*, primarily under Medicare’s annual election period process.

***Market Coverage***

They are focused on driving membership growth through geographic and market share expansion and are allocating resources and taking strategic actions to increase Their share in existing markets and enter into new markets. As a result, their revenue, growth rate and long-term profitability are also affected by their ability to achieve both objectives. **As of December 31, 2020**, they **offered plans in 34 MA markets across seven states** with **8% market** **share** of the individual, non-special needs plans (“non-SNP”) MA enrollees in these markets. **They have launched in 74 additional MA markets, expanding their footprint by an additional state, in 2021.**

**Total MA Market Growth 2021 YTD vs 2020:** **From 34 to 108 MA markets - 217% YOY Growth**

**Total Revenue Per Member (2019):** **$10,853 per member**

**Total Revenue Per Member (2020):**  **$11,590 per member**

**Total Revenue Growth YOY 2019-2020:** **46%**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**MACHINE LEARNING IS THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY**

They are singularly focused on creating great, sustainable healthcare to improve every life. They have centered Their strategy on building and deploying technology that they believe **will enable them to solve a significant data problem while avoiding the limitations of legacy approaches**. Currently, as a next-generation Medicare Advantage insurer, they leverage their flagship software platform, the Clover Assistant, to provide America’s seniors with PPO and HMO plans that are the obvious choice for Medicare-eligible consumers.

They call Their plans “Obvious” because they believe they are highly affordable—offering most of Their members the lowest average out-of-pocket costs for primary care physician co-pays, specialist co-pays, drug deductibles and drug costs in their markets—and provide wide network access and the same cost-sharing (co-pays and deductibles) for physicians who are in- and out-of-network. **By empowering physicians with data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care through their software platform, they believe they can improve clinical decision-making and viably offer these “Obvious” plans at scale, through an asset-light approach. They reach a broad array of consumers, including traditionally underserved populations.**

They drive adoption and use of the Clover Assistant across their network of primary care physicians (“PCPs”) by focusing on continuously improving its user-centric design, highly actionable and real-time clinical content, enhanced and rapid payment for Clover Assistant visits and simple onboarding.

As of December 31, 2020, over 2,400 PCPs had contracted to use the Clover Assistant to manage Their members’ care. High PCP engagement with the Clover Assistant enables real-time, data-driven decision-making for Their members at the point of care and drives rapid software iteration\*\*: the more that physicians use the Clover Assistant, the more it learns\*\* and furthers the precision of personalized data-driven recommendations. **They combine their payor data with physician-generated data and use this powerful closed feedback loop to continuously tune their clinical rules and machine learning models**, as well as to select and prioritize future software capabilities.

**The use and continuous improvement of the Clover Assistant has resulted in not only improved clinical decision-making but also strong plan performance.** The platform also facilitates identifying and engaging with their most at-risk members for their clinical programs designed to provide additional targeted care support, which is designed to further drive better plan performance. Taken together, they believe these enhancements will allow them to return a material portion of their savings to members through their “Obvious” plans and to continuously lower their members’ out-of-pocket costs and provide them with market-leading benefits.

Your Car Is About To Be a Software Platform, Subscriptions and All  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/your-car-is-about-to-be-a-software-platform-subscriptions-and-all

Read this article and tell me that BB is not smack bang in the middle of this. 

1) Auto companies increasingly focused on software to optimize car performance and deliver on demand services. This is the way things are going and this trend towards a connected “smart” car is only accelerating. 

2) Safety and security are key when it comes to introducing software into vehicles. And this shit is super complex so no reasonable Auto OEM (except maybe TSLA) will try to develop a proprietary in house software solution at significant cost. 

3) Luckily there is also a superb off the shelf solution to OEM’s available in the form of QNX and IVY. BB quietly worked on this over the past years without getting any attention and now BB is the de facto leader in automotive software solutions with safety and security a key competence of the firm. 

4) Now its time to monetize all that hard work. BB already has 23/25 of the global auto OEMs signed up as customers so we will begin to see these partnerships translate into sales. In the next 5 years most if not all new cars will have some kind of BB software embedded inside.

This stock is shit. This stock is so shit, it’s rated as one of MarketBeat’s worst stocks to invest in. This is why people are often shorting. Attached is a link to MarketWatch’s report of short sale/interest history since last November.

[Aurora Cannabis ACB Short Sale Data](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ACB/short-interest/)

Aurora Cannabis is extremely volatile in those data points from November and December. As short interest approaches 40,000,000, the underlying stock price jumps upward. When approaching 40,000,000, there is difficulty covering shorts. You will notice when Aurora Cannabis has a massive price spike, the short interest drops rapidly from the point near 40,000,000.

In periods of low volume, bulls are holding and 🌈 🐻 are in extreme anxiety with the upcoming earnings report release. Those high price points in November and December came on from shorts placed at lower price points, subsequently pushing the price into those $10+ scenarios when unable to cover.

On the trading day of Friday April 30th, the volume was extremely low at 3.42M shares traded. People are quietly asking around to borrow ACB shares at major interest rates for shorts which make it unprofitable (60-70% instead of the traditional 5-20%).

With 36,420,000 shorts and an earnings report coming on 05/13 after-hours, Aurora Cannabis ACB is going to rise from $8.85 to over $10 by Friday, May 7th. On Monday, May 10th, volatility city is coming. The price will instantly jump all over the fucking place.

I bought tons of ACB $12c 05/21. I plan to sell between 05/11-05/14. Unusual options activity highlighted ACB $9c 05/21 on Barcharts. After I sell the Calls, I will switch to out-of-the-money Puts set to expire in June with all my profits.

I know tons of you are common stock bag holders. Let’s get your money back with options. I don’t care if you get rich on calls or puts. They’re both going to work when the stock has a bi-polar episode in the month of May.

May the tendies be with you.

n3wwlk,,wallstreetbets,post,1620050640,"Is NKLA undervalued or insignificant - My Nikola Clear Up People seem confused about Nikola’s worth. Let’s try to clear things up. 

To get into the EV stocks, best thing is to understand a bit about EV’s.

What’s the difference between: electric vehicles, powered electric vehicles and plug-in vehicles?  Also what is the difference between hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles? So, here is a simple explanation. 

**Electric, power electric and plug-in are all the same**: They run on electricity,  use a lithium battery and **need to be re-charged by plugging them into a socket.** 

**The hydrogen vehicles are also electric.** But, instead of a lithium battery, they have a hydrogen tank that produces the electricity. So they are similar to regular vehicles in that, **when needed, you fill up the tank, just, instead of gas, you fill it up with hydrogen.**

**Pros of hydrogen vehicles?** It takes five minutes to fill up the tank.There isn’t a “range” problem with them. In theory, you can drive them very long distances as long as you have a hydrogen station along the way.

As opposed to lithium batteries. You can drive a Tesla about 200 miles before you need to recharge it. Yep, Tesla will tell you it’s 400 miles, but practically, it’s 200 (400 would be if you are driving alone, no passengers, in a straight line with nothing stopping you all the way, (like a traffic light) or slowing you down (like slopes, curves, bad weather). 

This is a HUGE difference. Think about it. 200 miles is a 3 hour drive at 70 miles per hour. If you have a 4 hour drive, you will need to recharge the battery for AT LEAST one hour, and probably way more. Your 4 hour drive just turned into a 7-8 or more hours…And that is IF you have where to charge along the way.

A hydrogen car you just need to refill the tank and be on your way. That sounds awesome. 

**Where is the catch**? Well, there are about 40000 electric charging stations in the USA. That is a solid number when compared to a bit over 100,000 regular gas stations. So, if you own an electric car, you have a decent chance of charging it. Although it might take you 4-8 hours, don’t forget. 

Meanwhile, there are like...wait for it...45 hydrogen stations in all of the USA. So, basically, if you have a hydrogen car (you don’t, it’s really experimental at this point), you don’t have where to fill up your tank. 

The other problem with hydrogen vehicles: to “produce” the hydrogen, you need power. It doesn’t just “exist”. So you need to “manufacture” it, so to speak. Nowadays, that costs too much. That is ONE reason Elon Musk says hydrogen cars are stupid. (He is only right as long as making hydrogen remains expensive…)

**But electric cars also have some important issues:**

You see, creating electricity has a price. That price depends on how you create that energy. Some electricity is super cheap, like that created using the sun, the wind or even nuclear energy. Others are expensive. Some countries have lots of electricity, others don’t. Some can create clean electricity. Others need to pollute the air in order to make electricity.

So 1st problem: electricity. If all cars would be electric cars, it would be a HUGE problem to provide electricity from a plug to all of them. In most countries or states, that wouldn’t work at all.

2nd huge issue with all electric cars: where to charge them. If you live in a house, have a garage, no problems. You come home, plug it in, go to sleep, in the morning the car is charged. 

But if you live in an apartment building, if you park your car in the street,  if you are too busy cause when you get back from work, you son/wife etc. take the car to do shopping, night studies, night job, whatever, when and where are you going to charge the car?

Bottom line: the biggest problem with electric CARS is that if everyone will have them, it will eat up too much electricity, there will be nowhere to charge them, and even worse, no time to charge them. Not everyone can have an electric car, gas cars aren’t disappearing that quickly. Too many private electric cars are going to become a huge headache. 

But trucks on the other hand….let’s think about it. Everyone wants to make electric trucks (or large vans) why? Well, it’s a smaller, more manageable fleet.  They are parked at designated spots or parking lots, easier to charge in that sense, the gas/money you save by turning a truck electric as opposed to a car, is much larger, and the truck brings in revenue so that even if it’s expensive, companies can offset that cost. 

**So now we understand:** 

1. Electric cars are awesome cause they are friendly to the environment, easy to maintain, and as soon as the lithium batteries become less expensive (they will, technology is making them cheaper by the day), you will be able to afford one!
2. Electric cars aren’t THAT awesome because it takes time and lots of electricity to charge them. Good luck doing a movie about a road trip using an electric car. You’ll have plenty of shots of people waiting at a charging station and making small-talk…
3. Hydrogen cars can solve the charging issue except that there are no hydrogen fill up stations (almost) and hydrogen is expensive as a solution right now.
4. The private electric car market is huge and awesome, just not as huge and as awesome as Elon Musk wants you to think it is.
5. Trucks are actually a better market for electric vehicles in the mid-term / current long term outlook. Whoever makes a good electric truck/van is going to be in an excellent position.
6. Equally, whoever develops hydrogen fueled cars best, will have an upper hand. 

**Which brings us to Nikola**. And what it has or doesn’t have. One could argue that Nikola is just a bunch of ideas. And nothing else. 

But that isn’t accurate. 

They actually have several patents to their name. Some of them are more related to visuals. What the truck would LOOK like. But others are about real technology. This is a big deal in a field that is all about new technology. If you own some of the concepts of how to transform that idea into a product, if you own that patent, then that can be worth a lot of money.

Nikola is suing Tesla for using some of its patents (the ones related to how the truck looks, not how it runs). Though the lawsuit has been ongoing for years and might keep going for a few more years, down the road it seems very probable that Tesla will need to pay Nikola a sizeable payday.

So Nikola has some value because of its patents, it’s a real player in this new technology. 

The 2nd thing we know for sure is Nikola is building a factory, and that factory is in fact being built, and it will start producing something, pretty soon. We need to understand what that something is....

Nikola is aiming at building an electric truck. So is Tesla. Also Ford, Daimler, Volvo...this is a market where many big names want to make a splash. And then there is Rivian. They have a 100,00 truck order (!!) from Amazon. And their IPO is coming out this year. 

**So now that we are EV “experts”, what is Nikola worth?**

No one has a reasonable, practical EV truck (maybe except BYD. But I don’t trust Chinese companies, because they do not operate with transparency, they’re fishy to me). Whomever gets a good EV truck on the road is bound to see a pretty nice spike in stock value. 

Rivian is planning on an IPO setting its initial value at 50 billion. Mind you, this is a company that has a 100,000 truck order for a truck that doesn’t exist yet. Its development is advanced, and they are hoping to deliver the truck to the market in the next few months. But 50 billion, considering this number can easily go to 70 as soon as the IPO is launched, is a lot of money. 

Nikola’s current value is at 4.5 billion. They are building a factory, they have hired many, many professionals, they have patents that show they understand the technology very well, they have experience building the prototypes (through which they got the patents). They are potentially a very, very cheap stock. 

Just news of the factory actually working and any kind of initial pre-order doubles the price of this stock. Hold it for 2-3 years, the chances for a tenfold valuation is reasonable. 

As far as Nikola’s hydrogen trucks. I wouldn’t bet on it. They need to set up the infrastructure to have hydrogen stations for filling up the tank at a national level. That is just billions of dollars in costs. They need to create the technology that lowers the cost of providing the hydrogen. That still doesn’t exist at a satisfying level. I wouldn’t build on that as an investor. If they do somehow get that going, their value increases through the roof. But if they start focusing on it too much, they could waste lots of money, like they have done before. 

**Bottom line:** NKLA isn’t as dead as people think, IMO. It has value, it has a real plan, it’s focusing on the right market (the trucks) and it will be worth way more. It isn’t going up anytime soon. But it’s a good time to get in. 

I’m not an advisor, I do not own NKLA stocks right now but plan on owning a position at some point in 2021. I just thought people would benefit from understanding this EV thing better.","['AMZN', 'TSLA']",,,,,,,

Yes, Elon Musk / SpaceX is definitely into space tourism.  But SpaceX is in a totally different league than Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.

VG and BO both offer **suborbital** joyrides--  Bring you to about 80-100km altitude and float down to experience a few minutes of zero-g.  VG and BO's rockets are not fast enough to reach orbit--  Just 1.0 km/s vs. 9.3 km/s for an orbital rocket like the SpaceX Falcon 9.

SpaceX offers **orbital** tourism in 2 different flavors:

1)  Launch you into low-earth orbit for 2-3 days in a Crew Dragon capsule.  This is the tourist ticket Shift4 Payments chairman Jared Isaacman bought, for himself and 3 other tourists.  Price undisclosed, but rumored to be about $220 million for the flight, and they will fly in September this year.  The space tourism company Space Adventures has also bought a Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon tourist flight like this one.

2) Launch on Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon to visit the ISS for a week.  This is what Axiom Space bought from SpaceX--  The Ax-1 mission is all set for next spring, with 1 professional astronaut and 3 millionaire tourists.  Tom Cruise also signed up for a later Axiom-brokered SpaceX Crew Dragon flight to the ISS.

The only competitor to SpaceX in the orbital tourism market right now is Roscosmos, with their Soyuz rocket/capsule.  They are also resuming selling Soyuz seats to tourists to visit the ISS for a week, about $40-some million per seat.",,,,,,,,

n2ojmq,,wallstreetbets,post,1619894655,"Cohu; the plug for your favorite semiconductor companiesWhat if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. 

Cohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. 

**Bullish trends**

1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. 
2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?
3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Tsm are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.
4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.
5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. 

**Bearish trends**

1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). 
2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. 
3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).

**Fundamental analysis**

I use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing).

Cohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000

$316 million/$1925 million=6.09

This is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. 

Cohu-6.09

aapl-19.12

amzn-18

ter-11.3

advantest-7.19

swks-17.9

If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.

Taking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \~$200 million today versus \~$300 million a year ago. 

&#x200B;

**Technical analysis**

[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)

As we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. 

In conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). 

Disclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company.

n2i6oj,,wallstreetbets,post,1619875150,"I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9

 Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan’21 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007

 Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.

**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.

**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.

**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm – Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.

**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Can I use the code/is it open source: Yes.

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

# TL;DR

**$130 calls on September 17 🚀 🚀 🚀**

**Expectation: Acquisition by Google.**

I discuss how to think about Fastly as an investment to folks who have reasoned that investing in cloud compute and networking is a good idea but may not necessarily understand how or why it’s a good idea. We focus on basic networking and the consequences of “serverless” computing; an architecture that has gained popularity in recent years.

I’ve written about Cloudflare before in May 2020, on an account called u/codingprofessor, before taking DD writing more seriously. I claimed that Cloudflare would blow past $60 dollars and was critically undervalued due to COVID economics, their current position in web security, and serverless computing. I still view that Cloudflare and Fastly can both reach 40B+ marketcaps by 2023.

&#x200B;

[Don't doubt your vibe](https://preview.redd.it/bgr8i8qmmjw61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bf7e7d98c3282535be6240c354322969fdd4bb1)

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that often gets filtered out.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation. Here are some recent DDs:

# Cloudflare vs. Fastly

**- TL;DR Fastly makes stuff faster, Cloudflare is more general purpose. They can be used together.**

[Support](https://preview.redd.it/8nw4s6mlojw61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7)

This is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike. In my view, the comparison isn’t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces. Fastly is focused on real-time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers. Cloudflare is a general network competitor. You can use both, and most do.

&#x200B;

[General purpose needs](https://preview.redd.it/8g9lk7uhwjw61.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6)

In a crude sense, Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco, while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart. It’s not to say that one is better than the other, because it's not. They just solve different problems with completely different approaches. You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart, but when you go to Costco, you're picking up and utilizing a lot more.

This explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co-operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage, Spotify network meshes, Google Cloud services, and other real-time demands from the tech industry.

&#x200B;

>""While a convenience store is generally closer to a person's home, it has a limited set of items for sale. If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip. In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN's with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly's approach with fewer, larger ones.""

&#x200B;

Cloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet - it wants to make the internet more accessible, safer, and fair. Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet. So in a nutshell, one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution.

An example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit’s execution of the r/place experiment in 2017 - which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real-time.

[Real-time collaboration services meets art and communtiy.](https://i.redd.it/2kf4qnoorjw61.gif)

This is only one example of many. The way I like to frame it is by viewing real-time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need, and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services. You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify, Ticketmaster, or The New York Times - all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management.

[world-class research](https://preview.redd.it/m9muspwsrjw61.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1)

A big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world-class from top to bottom, from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence. They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition. They research, experiment, and execute on the boundary of networking, making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view.

The result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used.  This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time. They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike.

&#x200B;

[the capex equation](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1xm5zrjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c)

Cloudflare's team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare's ability to be compliant to global requirements. This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long-term, Fastly's general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network.

The compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly's speeds, in the microseconds, is exponentially faster than Cloudflare's serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range. This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman, who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long-term.

[Matt Prince's Hierarchy of Developer's Needs](https://preview.redd.it/9afefjyasjw61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1)

Why does this distinction matter? Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical, like hospital communications, stock market crashes, wildfires, or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network?

&#x200B;

>The way to think about this is, what do you pay for, right? I mean if you -- and where are these moments that are valuable. When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again, that matters, that moment matters. Everyone is going to tweet about it, and everyone wants to see it, the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content. When you send a gift across the Internet, like it's not monetized in the same way, it's not as valued.. So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer, where they're willing to pay for it and the quality, and the security and the scale of that deeply matters. And we have always focused our work on that type of content. There's plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity. Every month, they want a lower price. That's a different market from our perspective, and we're not in it."" - Fastly CEO

# Understanding Content Delivery

**- TL;DR You have data, you cut the data into smaller pieces, send it across a network, and rebuild those pieces somewhere else.**

[The global cache](https://preview.redd.it/a92mp9wesjw61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98e66b61a7b13f89a4556399c8264a038bb16ac)

It’s helpful to understand the 7  steps that protocols take as they travel across and through a network around the world. This model is known as the OSI model and it’s not necessarily the end-all-be-all model that governs the internet; but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance.

There are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research. At the same time, many of these steps follow a similar process - translate or transform the data that’s received and sent.

&#x200B;

[Edge computing, an extension of the cloud.](https://preview.redd.it/r5k1yknbyjw61.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=60bbe4420f4025c8c791d62c569453ce82a8a8b0)

For example, the web browser translates the data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals. This may not make too much sense yet, but just remember that it’s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware.

&#x200B;

[Email, zoom calls, pins, streams, different network flavors.](https://preview.redd.it/kvhajfjtujw61.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2570ebd03b9fd5c08989b0b5551d9eea2c5c3c44)

&#x200B;

1. **Application Layer:** You initiate a Zoom call. It has passed through the application layer using an real-time messaging protocol. It sends the video to the presentation layer.
2. **Presentation Layer:** The video data is received and compressed. It gets sent to the session layer.
3. **Session Layer:** A communication session is initiated. A network communication is initiated, with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes.
4. **Transportation Layer:** The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation.
5. **Network Layer:** Once the data has reached this stage, the segments are converted to packets.
6. **Data Link Layer:** The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer.
7. **Physical Layer:** The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation, which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable.

&#x200B;

[OSI Model](https://preview.redd.it/68fe020vsjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f4ae86782c3c87978af6e4a9bf46d1b0f695347)

As the data reaches its destination, it goes through the 7 layer process again in the opposite direction, where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer (the person who you sent an Zoom call to). There’s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times.

What are the complexities related to delivering a letter, a box of clothes, or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood? So that’s the essence behind content-delivery networks - preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths.

It’s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this. They may be words or ideas that you’ve heard - routers, bitstreams, addresses, and so on. What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin, playing a Spotify stream, or setting up a Zoom call without a video? How do we utilize location data when it comes to COVID containment efforts? What are the consequences of correcting a news article, fact checking a social media post, or reconciling the differences in video game connections in a game like Call of Duty?

&#x200B;

[Networking meets human experiences](https://preview.redd.it/d5nbigz1tjw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=d39cdad6269f4b7d224fff12e6c39adc60584d60)

With this developing model in mind, consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network, while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further. They seek to solve different platforms, while having obvious overlaps at the same time.

# Serverless Compute - The Event Driven Network

**TL;DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products.**

[The event driven network](https://preview.redd.it/lhez9rq6tjw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7)

What serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network. There are two major benefits to serverless computing:

1. It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box.

For example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless ""function-as-a-service"" can provide that capacity for a developer.

https://preview.redd.it/bm6jwodptjw61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd

That image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well. Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area, edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location.

&#x200B;

[Functions as a service](https://preview.redd.it/1trzui6ctjw61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3)

2. It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure tosupport it.

Imagine that a product that benefits off real-time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers. A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob-in-the-hood during spikes of activity or Reddit's own ability to handle surges of logins, registrations, and activity after events like GME's stock market explosion. Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft's expansion releases, where servers were effectively ""on fire"" and required round-the-clock support.

Edge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective. If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1,000,000 users, a serverless architecture allows for intelligent ""autoscaling"" - which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me. This ultimately results in a metered pay-as-you-go system.

&#x200B;

[The network as a utility](https://preview.redd.it/hq7l51wwtjw61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f88e8d28b452a5bf0a7d0c560e22e8b2ba0f7a)

The combination of these two benefits is pretty powerful, allowing a developer to essentially start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace. I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing. Here are some simple questions I like to think about:

&#x200B;

[we've all been there.](https://preview.redd.it/ydk0hfx7ujw61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9)

\- Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies?

\- How do we improve the security of individual network-connected devices?

\- Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching?

\- Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences?

\- Will online video games require servers bounded by location?

\- Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream?

\- Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics?

\- Are we able to extend programmability to ""node"" based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations?

&#x200B;

[ 🚀](https://preview.redd.it/5otn5vekvjw61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=14201da0292e3f895dc829239999889d0af43add)

Some of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves, as they list the following subjects of interest in their S-1:

1. **API acceleration**. Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences, such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real-time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts;
2. **IoT**. Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time-sensitive applications;
3. **Cloud migration**. Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments, enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers
4. **Enabling redactedchain (block)**. Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain (block) in real time.

# Conclusion

TL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.

You may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report. Those things need to just check out.","['HD', 'KSU', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'ADSK', 'GOOGL']",,,,,,,

Company Description (From their website)

Nano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.

**Sounds cool, doesn't it?** Anyways, here's some information on the company and some short term catalysts.

**Where They Can Sell**

In several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. Most recently, in March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station.

**Cathie Wood**

She is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\* as of 4/30/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.

ARKQ (8,425,766 Shares)

ARKW (5,383,591 Shares)

IZRL (789,242 Shares)

PRNT (1,934,283 Shares)

**Revenue**

It's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.

In 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.

In pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.

\*As stated on their earnings call, no guidance was given\*

**Cash on hand**

Every time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION

(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)

Yes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.

To put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.

**Acquisitions**

The company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)

So far, they've acquired two companies in the past two weeks (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)

DeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)

NanoFabrica (3D Printing - \*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\~$59 Million TOTAL - \~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \*The final numbers are not confirmed\*

So they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.

Their plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.

Type A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!

Type B - Technologies they think their machines need

Type C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.

**Unusual Option Activity**

Specifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.

May 21st Options (\*As of 4/30/21)

$7.50 - 35,197 Open Interest

$10.00 - 35,875 Open Interest

$12.50 - 22,308 Open Interest

Should also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.

$7.50 PUT - 20,552 Open Interest

**Stock Activity**

I'm not much of a stock chart analyst, and I don't think ""technicals"" matter for a stock like this. If you take a look at the YTD chart, it's pretty ugly. Ever since February, $NNDM and plenty of other ""growth"" stocks have been hit hard. After a high of $17.89, it's fallen as low as the low $6.00 range. 

**Upcoming Catalysts** 

* Earnings are expected to be around mid-may. Last earnings, despite low numbers (for this stock revenue isn't that important yet) the stock ran up from mid $6 range to over $11 in under 2 weeks.
* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release by summer time.
* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 the past 2 weeks)

**Two Good Articles Worth Reading**

A very bullish article was posted to Yahoo Finance last week on Nano Dimension, and it's worth the read.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html))

*""This is a $1.8 billion company. The PCB market is marching towards $70-plus billion in value. Nano Dimension is sitting on a breakthrough technology that could disrupt that entire market.*

*Long term, you’re talking a potentially multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity, the likes of which could easily result in a $10-plus billion valuation…""*

Cathie Wood actually briefly mentioned Nano Dimension during an interview.

*A key quote from her is ""We always look for where the defense is putting their money""*

**The Negatives**

* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%) 
* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash
* COVID is still impacting Europe, and they have a decent customer base out there

n1t0yz,,wallstreetbets,post,1619786577,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market. 

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/oo61ht373bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8d785445785475c739f84ea3638bb820420bb2

As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark.  

https://preview.redd.it/qo4xaop93bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bf4985e21430a811827242ce9b3587e9a4ae25a

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

n24jla,,wallstreetbets,post,1619820118,"INFLATION NATION The current economic data being released combined with recent statements from large corporations about pricing should be ringing inflation alarm bells. It’s not just meme stocks that are mooning, the price of everything is going thru the roof. Could it be that the inevitable hangover from the money printer going BRRRRR is approaching? I have no idea, but the numbers are staggering.

Let’s look past the bullshit CPI which registered 2.6% for the March reading. The everyday items you and I consume are going up by much larger amounts than the FEDs favorite inflation gauge. Take housing prices for example, which everyone knows are going up at a crazy rate. February year over year increase was 12% nationally and shows no sign of slowing down. In my area, houses are selling in days at 20-25% over list. But the CPI doesn’t reflect this. The CPI tries to estimate housing inflation using “owner equivalent rent” which is what a homeowner would pay to rent their own house. The cost of the house is ignored in this equation, the focus being on the cost of the shelter it provides instead. That’s great, unless you want to buy a house. 

The prices of just about everything that it takes to build that house are going up too. The price of a new lot to build on is up 11% YOY and will likely continue to climb as supply of new lots is down 20% in that same period. The materials that make up the home are up as follows:

Lumber: +67% YTD

Copper: +27% YTD

Gypsum: +7% YOY

Steel Mill Products: +18% YOY

Add in a shortage of construction workers, a national push for higher wages and ultra-low interest rates and housing shows no signs of becoming more affordable anytime soon. 

Fulfilment costs are going up across the board as well, due to numerous factors. Disruptions in the global shipping markets have led to price increases of 25-50% on shipping containers. A shortage of U.S. truck drivers will also lead to higher shipping costs, as well as having the add on affect of raising the cost of gas. Typically, 10% of U.S. tanker capacity is idle, currently it is 20-25% idle due to the shortage. Summer driving season is approaching. This may cause a feedback loop of higher gas prices as supply struggles to keep up with demand, negatively impacting consumers and businesses alike. 

To compound the aforementioned issues, the prices of the commodities and inputs used to produce a broad range of goods are also increasing rapidly. Look at these increases in just the last month alone:

Cocoa: +2.5%

Coffee: +12.7%

Sugar: +13.6%

Lean Hogs: +6.3%

Rough Rice: +3.6%

Oats: +7.4%

Soybeans: +7.7%

Wheat: +18%

Corn: +18.5%

Farmers are now substituting wheat grown for human consumption as animal feed due to the huge increase in the price of corn. This feedstock inflation can trickle thru the butcher block and dairy isle and potentially increase prices of meat, chicken, milk, eggs and cheese, just to name a few. 

In the recent earnings calls of several multi-national corporations the topic of pricing and supply chain issues was highlighted. Coke and Pepsi are both going to raise prices, and if you look at the price of sugar, the reason is obvious. P&G and Mondelez both announced intentions to do the same, and Kraft spoke about rising costs across it supply chains. Selling a smaller amount for the same price isn’t gonna cut it this time anymore. Prices are going up. 

So, inflation appears to be working its way thru commodities markets and supply chains and will soon be knocking on the door. Printer’s days of going BRRRR may be catching up with us. Don’t worry though, you likely won’t be affected. Unless you live inside, drive, eat, drink coffee or pop, shop online or have anything to do with those industries, you’ll be just fine!",,,,,,,,

The EV battery market is expected to reach 67 billion dollars by 2025. QS is a high risk high reward proposition that has recently suffered a short attack from a hedge fund with a bad reputation for releasing over exaggerated claims to tank stocks.

**Short Attack:** The short attack was accompanied by a long report with ""battery experts"" and former employees. Most of these claims surrounded issues with the battery technology itself. In reading the report, I don't see anything beyond typical problems that a company creating new technology would face (nothing that the average investor wouldn't already know). The report goes on and on slamming the CEO and the company for various actions and statements. On a personal note, reading through it made me sick. How is it that this is not market manipulation? The report spreads fear and tanks the stock right as they take a huge short interest.

**QS Reply:** The CEO has replied by stating they strongly believe in their technology, although they can't release any specifics (proprietary technology) they stand behind their work. Honestly, I don't think they have anything to prove at the moment. The company indeed won't generate revenue for another couple of years but they have never claimed to be able to. They have an investor in Bill gates and VW - who has tested the batteries in their own lab and chose to continue their investment.

**From VW:** “We are pleased to report that the QuantumScape cells met the technical milestones in our labs in Germany that we had previously agreed upon,” said Frank Blome, head of the Volkswagen Group’s Center of Excellence Battery Cell. “Achievement of this milestone is an important step for QuantumScape, and we look forward to receiving and testing subsequent generations of cells to get solid-state technology into series production.”

[FSD from Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/cvpxp3mgrhw61.png?width=1746&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d959d4fd9ffe476e5283c255656645038cd96d)

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into perception-planning-control blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD.  Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.  

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 10s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + hd maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach. 

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about perception part.  So as I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years. 
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate. 
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago. Check this video from Waymo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYwS-gtAJMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYwS-gtAJMo)
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

Alright, suppose Tesla solved this perception problem successfully using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next?  We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the actually hardest part.  What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents:  the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even it look more ""amazing"":

The hard problem lies in busy, urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive?  How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc, but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties which may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015 ish, and it is an area that Tesla barely touches today.  See this video of a Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk&t=28s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk&t=28s)

It still struggles to get out elegantly (thought it is pretty safe).  There is also a recent video on FSD in SF:

It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05449.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05449.pdf)

Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.  

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long:  Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  And Tesla is not even reporting disengagement data for now. However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales pov). 

TLDR:  Robo-taxis is far, self driving is fun :)","['RL', 'MPC', 'TSLA', 'HD']",,,,,,,

n2gb8b,gwmeyzx,wallstreetbets,comment,1619927880,"Mobileye (which services like 13 of the top manufacturers) owned by Intel has promised robo taxi's in 2022 as of their earnings call last week. Obviously geofenced, and in limited areas, but it seems promising considering Tesla originally used mobileye, and the alleged reason for the breakup was that Intel was not comfortable with how quick and careless Tesla was pushing FSD, and didnt want to associate mobileye with any deaths, which of course Tesla ended up killing some people with their own solution.

Also I am extremely skeptical that Tesla is able to keep its marketing promise of model 3 and other vehicles having level 5 capable hardware. I guarantee there will be a class action lawsuit over this when FSD officially launches (years, they will keep it in beta for as long as possible) and Tesla starts using more and better cameras in their vehicles.

Uber exited the space to nobodies surprise.

Waymo is in the same territory as Mobileye, but who are the actual customers? Again, Mobileye owns the majority of the autonomous car market, then you have a handful of companies like Tesla doing their own thing, so unless Google contracts out a manufacturer to make their Waymo cars, where is the tech going? Are they just using it to either collect data or sell the trained NN? AFAIK the only information ever given was back in 2019 when the CEO of Waymo said ""we made agreement with American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. to lease a factory in Detroit, where it will integrate its self-driving systems onto vehicles provided by *Fiat Chrysler* Automobiles and *Jaguar.*"" Basically retrofitting the shittiest cars on the market, that does not seem like a good business plan.","['GOOGL', 'TSLA', 'INTC']",,,,,,,
n2ac90,,wallstreetbets,post,1619840004,"DD My Fat Ex-wife edition - Becky Stocks - Etsy - Down 5% April 30th, not going to stay down.It's  afterhours Friday April 30th and the market just took a bit of a dump.  Nothing to panic over but a solidly red day following an all time high.  Previously I have focused by DD efforts into research on Boomer Stocks.   Great stocks with real products, strong histories of growth, objectively clear market conditions (e.g. steel is up bigly US Steel will likely have a great Q2)

This week I need to focus on the other side of my portfolio - Becky Stocks.   My fat ex-wife always makes me add some Becky to our portfolio so I looked into the Becky index and found ETSY.  It looked like a solid option at first with earnings still approaching and other similar stocks gaining post earnings (Amazon, Shopify), but then to top it off it dumped 5% today.  A $25 billion dollar company lost over a $1 billion in value in a single day.  Not because of any particular negative news or anything, it appears to just be a general sell-off.

**Does Becky still like Etsy? - Yes**

Etsy has grown revenue and profits by margins ranging from 100 to 500% YoY growth in all the key financial metrics.  Etsy is more popular than ever and Google Trends data/Alexa rankings don't show a noteworthy slowdown.  ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh\_&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh_&geo=US))

**Does Becky have incentive to buy cute Etsy items as things slowly open up? - Yes**

Responsible Becky hasn't had the ability to host house parties or show off newest 'Live, Laugh, Love' decor.  Everyone wants to get out and see friends/family and Becky knows that theme parties and custom theme'd decor is he best way to prepare for these parties.   Just as a general rule there is suddenly a lot more incentive to make your house more guest friendly moving forward.  

**Was Etsy just over-valued and dumping?**  

While the P/E for Etsy is high at 76 that is comparable to Amazon (who is going to rate lower partially because they just had great earnings while Etsy hasn't reported yet to clear out Q1 2020 from it's ratings) and less than companies like Square and Shopify.  Obviously growth is assumed, but Etsy clearly has room to grow so it should not be a problem.  Etsy is currently trading almost $50 below it ATH from March 1st and while having wild swings over the past months it has been generally stable as a stock and there isn't any reason to suspect another major shift downward.

**TL D/R What does it all Mean?**

Etsy is a solid growth stock that appears to be at or near bottom with an earnings report coming up that will likely be favorable.  Other companies in online retail have seen boosts from good earnings so why not Etsy?  

&#x200B;

**Boomer Thoughts**

Etsy may be 'Tech' but it is harnessing the ingenuity of the American people to create new and unique products.  They have already shown that they have strong management by using their early pandemic mask sales jump to gain, retain, and boost their customer base.   Hard workers making physical goods with solid leadership makes for a good company.  They don't have a dividend yet but they are new and need to reinvest in the company.  Considering their primarily female audience making efforts to reach out to men would be a great next step.  Improving the search function could certainly help.

**Fat Ex-Wife Thoughts**

There is no way Etsy is going to stay down this low.  Everyone I know is using Etsy for personal products and gifts.  Amazon is great for generic products but it has become absolute trash when you want to find something meaningful due to the way generic products flood the market for just about anything you want.  Etsy makes online shopping fun again while Amazon shopping is about as fun as running any errand.  It is going back up to its 250 ATH and beyond.   Just hold on for a while!  My Ex-husband wants to buy US steel instead.  They already had earnings and already went up.  He has all quarter to rotate what's left of his losses into X.  I want my part of the portfolio in something happy!

**Positions**

None, plan to buy calls for the end of May either ITM or slightly OTM Monday

This stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. 



2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.



3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.



4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.



5. Options IV is a complete joke right now and a great opportunity to get in.
