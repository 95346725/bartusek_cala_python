Some highlights:

> The world’s largest contract chipmaker said Thursday that its **automaker industry clients can expect chip shortages to begin easing next quarter**, alleviating some of the supply disruptions that have forced the likes of GM and Ford to curtail production. **But overall deficits of critical semiconductors will last throughout 2021 and potentially into next year**, Chief Executive Officer C.C.

> TSMC now expects investments of about **$30 billion on capacity expansions and upgrades this year, after spending $8.8 billion in the first three months, Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. The company had previously forecast spending of as much as $28 billion.** Sales in the June quarter may reach $13.2 billion, beating the average $12.8 billion seen by analysts, while full-year revenue may climb 20% in dollar terms, ahead of the “mid-teens” growth predicted in January.

> [...]

> **Net income for the January-March period climbed 19% to NT$139.7 billion ($4.9 billion), versus the average analyst estimate of NT$136.2 billion.** Gross margin for the quarter eased to 52.4% from 54% in the three months prior, due in part to relatively lower levels of utilization and exchange-rate fluctuations. First-quarter revenue rose 17% to NT$362.4 billion, according to a company statement last week.

mr512k,,stocks,post,1618451198,"Bit of a philosophical question, but how did stocks become the path to retirement, building wealth, a gauge of the economy, etc?after the IPO, whatever happens to the stocks is just between us investors. It is not like stocks are directly moved by how well a company is doing, like how delta is between options prices and the underlying stock price.

No, there is no guarantee like delta, if the underlying company makes this much $, the stock price will move by x amount too

A company can do really well, and if there is no demand, the stock price never moves up.

So I don’t really get it.

That’s like if a group of 100 people bought/sold rocks to each other based on what they felt/thought about some rocks. The rocks (shares) are pretty useless though.

We are all just **trading** with each other, and giving shares value. If we all decided no, I don’t want to give this share value, there would be no stock market.

maybe like a giant MLM? Where we want others to pay more than we paid for something but we have an endless supply of people, as long as every generation does it. The people who bought at the lowest are on the top of the pyramid, and the only way the stock market thrives/continues is that the next person is willing to pay more and more. Doesn't this seem kind of sketch?

How did this become the path to retirement, building wealth, a gauge of economy etc?

mr512k,gukd4y6,stocks,comment,1618455976,"Wow literally no one gave you the answer: the answer is actually very simple and it's called *dividends*

When a company pays dividends, it basically pays you for holding their stock. Theoretically, people buy and sell stocks depending on how much dividends they believe the company will be able to pay on the future. High earning companies tend not only to pay high dividends but also to increase them with time.

Take Tesla for example. Right now they're basically reinvesting most of their cash back into the company in order to grow it. But what happens when the company achieves all it's goals and starts printing more money than they can reinvest in growing themselves? Well, they can start giving the owners (i.e. the stock holders) a quarterly bonus out of the piles of cash they're making.

When someone buys a Tesla stock for 750$, what they're basically speculating about is: will Tesla be able to give me a good quarterly payment higher than the risk-free money or low risk money I can make buying less speculative assets like bonds.

Will Tesla make enough money to, let's say, pay an annualized 2%-4% on their stock in 10-15 years? Only time will tell. But if you don't believe they will be able to afford that then yes, you're just speculating and betting of you're willing to pay those prices.",['TSLA']
mr512k,guk9c14,stocks,comment,1618453891,"> A company can do really well, and if there is no demand, the stock price never moves up.


Not really. If investors were too stupid to ever buy a really profitable company, they would offer a dividend and at some point this dividend would be too good to pass up. For example, Microsoft is currently able to pay out 2.24 for every shares thanks to their profits. If investors became dumb and all sold their shares, at some point this 2.24 would become ridiculously good. Let's say if it became 5x cheaper.... you would make 2.24 for a 50$ share on a company that just keeps growing every years lol",['MSFT']
mr512k,guktbw7,stocks,comment,1618467248,"you guys have already given great and concise answers about dividends being the incentive to own particular stocks. 

But I wanted to discuss also the perception of a company's value. 

Stock is part ownership of a company. So in a sense it's far more productive than a shining piece of gold will ever be. 

Someone once said that the stock market is a chart of rich people's feelings, and I don't necessarily disagree. But if the poor and the middle class realize that owning a few shares of a great company (which is the same as owning a part of that company itself) is better than saving money in a bank (because money doesn't produce any goods; businesses do), then the stock market would be a chart of everyone's feelings. And if traders decided to buy or sell stock based on business fundamentals rather than momentary fads or trends, then the chart would more accurately reflect the health and productivity of the market's businesses as a whole.  

The reason why certain stocks soar and others plateau or fall, is due to the free market's constant assessment of a company's health and productivity in relation to its competitors. 

Taken day-to-day, the movement of the stock market is subject to human whimsy and caprice. 

Taken year-to-year, the patterns become distinct. The market trends, the historical and technological and consumerist trends, become quite clear. A company's innovations and market share gains correspond to (but do not cause) price increases.",

mqyv3r,,stocks,post,1618430876,"How to bounce back after losing so much?Hey guys, don’t know if this is the right sub for this but I need some advice. 

I am currently 21 years old, and started investing during the crash last year. I slowly grew my portfolio to around 8,000$ and had $1000 cash saved up. I had a strategy of dividend stock investing with some growth stocks in there. 

Fast foward to Jan 2021 and I was addicted to the stockmarket. My friend told me to learn about options and debit spreads and all that good stuff. I started making a ton of money with options (because of state of the market before mid-febuary). I grew my portfolio to around 15,000. I had no guidance I was just learning as I went. 

Well, since I did not realize the downside of options, I was heavily leveraged in options so my portfolio over the last month has basically evaporated. Im down to 4,000 dollars now, and I know I should just construct a good portfolio with risk taken into consideration, but at this point, I feel so set back that I am discouraged to just live my life with some safe stocks and continue to add money over time. 

Basically, every time I think about the money I’ve lost it makes me discouraged in investing in big cap stocks that will make me 5-20% because I will still be far behind compared to where I was before. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the money I’ve lost and wished I had someone to tell me to take some profits when I was doing so well. I did learn a lot from losing all this money, but I have so little now that I feel like it doesn’t even matter. 

Also I know the amount of money is peanuts to many, but I am just a college student and wanted to use the money I made in the market to invest in real estate, and now I feel like that goal is 10x farther than it was in Feb. 

Any advice would be very appreciated.",

I learned a really expensive lesson about massive IPOs that many people were trying to explain yesterday. 

My advice is advice I need to take myself. Only make options trades you are okay with going to 0. Because they do it a lot.

Also - money is just money. You can always make more later. Don’t let losses ruin your mental health or personal wellbeing. If you find yourself addicted or feeling unhealthy about it, talk to someone about it. As a college student you have SO MUCH time to screw up and still come out completely fine.",

mqzvok,,stocks,post,1618433903,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 14, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

**Highlights**

* Coinbase debuted in the market today via direct listing. It was a volatile day, with shares opening at $381 before jumping to a high of around $429 before closing at $328.28.

* Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio confirmed its long-awaited partnership with China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation to set up battery swap stations at Sinopec’s gas filling stations. Sinopec is the largest supplier of refined oil products and petrochemicals as well as the second-largest oil and gas producer in China.

mr3ex1,,stocks,post,1618445219,"When I hear about Coinbase being a bad investment a couple of other tech giants that were ""destined to fail"" come to mind.Let me get this out of the way. I own 1 (like uno) share of COIN at $320. I'm prepared to buy 1 share for every $20 it falls below that if it does continue to drop. I want to reflect on two tech companies that were supposed to be ""dead in the water"" dozens of earning calls ago. Netflix and Facebook. 

I remember following Facebooks IPO in particular and the internet as a whole (as well as myself) said it's ABSOLUTELY DEAD MONEY. There was no way it was ever going to continue to make money. Everyone around me was ""leaving it."" The valuation was ""insane."" The stock price tanked pretty good out of the gates and everyone laughed. It stayed low for weeks (maybe months if I remember right) and I patted myself on the back for staying away. As earnings gained more and more traction the perception started to change. What was pointed out was that the parents of Facebook users were becoming more active then any of the core group that gave facebook it's start. These same people really enjoyed playing the browser games that most ""kids"" lost interest in. Businesses started using it to reach clients. Facebook itself didn't change but the user base did. As time goes on it continues to make good money and the stock has proven to be a good money maker. It defied the popular opinion. 

When we think about too much competition in the future Netflix comes to mind. Netflix was also supposed to have been ""cooked"" ages ago because of the competition that was coming about. When Prime Video launched it was the ""end of Netflix's growth."" When the users in America were maxed out there was ""no room for growth."" Netflix grew globally and offered exclusive content. There ended up being plenty of room for many streaming companies and everyone has been making money (this could be debated today but I'm comparing to ten years ago here). 

I assume you get my comparisons to Coinbase. The arguments against Coinbase are that the valuation is too high and there is no room for growth. The platform sucks and everyone on reddit is ""leaving it."" There are tons of companies that will steal business from Coinbase to make them unprofitable. 

I would argue we've seen this before. If Crypto has the future so many of you think it does then there should be plenty of business opportunities for everyone. The grandmas and grandpas that aren't in Crypto yet will go to the most legitimate company in the space (COIN). If my kids grandparents can call any video streaming platform ""Netflix"" I assume the same is possible for all crypto exchanges being called ""a Coinbase."" Being first and top of mind goes a long way. The potential customer base out there is huge for COIN and for others. 

Side note: ETFs will be picking up COIN for their portfolios as they are required. A lot of institutions will be holding COIN soon if they aren't already. 

Sorry this post got a bit sloppy. I started out with a lot of good points in my head but they didn't type out that way. I'm on my phone in a waiting room killing time. There are good arguments against my arguments but I don't think we are seeing enough of the supporting ones for Coinbase.

TL;DR Facebook was a ""for sure"" flop when it went public for similar reasons as COIN. Netflix also was supposed to fail a number of times due to capped growth. Lastly, in my opinion anyone who owns TSLA doesn't have a right to talk about stocks being overvalued.","['TSLA', 'NFLX', 'FB']"

mqzmof,,stocks,post,1618433140,"Walmart Thesis Statement (04/07/21)Did my own personal DD on a few companies and WMT stood out.  Thought I would share it here.  Not really looking for comment or criticism just sharing my own findings.  I've been writing my own thesis statements for investments > $10,000 for the last few years.  My last successful venture was $DIS and I also shared my thesis statement here around two years ago.  Full disclosure, I've purchased 80 shares as of this morning.  Writeup was completed as of 04/07/21 and I will send my analyses via excel to anyone interested.

**Walmart Thesis Statement:**

Walmart Corp. is growing its eCommerce presence and maintains a dominant position in the retail industry. Walmart is able to differentiate from its competitors due to the niche market of affordable products in a brick and mortar format that is augmented by its growing online presence. Walmart maintains the highest revenue amongst its competitors (listed below) and is currently relatively undervalued due to short-term financial statements which show a negative net income growth which can be directly attributed to investments in online growth. Assuming a rational market, Walmart is undervalued relative to its direct competitors. It maintains its market capitalization as a retail corporation which will reap the benefits of a growing online economy.  In this paper, a justification for a Market Capitalization of $500B will be made with supporting fundamental and competitor analyses.

**Background Information:**

Price as of Wednesday, 04/07/21: $140.16

Direct Competitors: Amazon, Target, Costco, Kmart, Kroger, ALDI, Walgreens, Tesco, Carrefour, Best Buy

Market Capitalization: $394.78B

P/E Ratio: 29.53 (Growth Mode)

Div. Yield: 1.57%

52-wk high: $153.66 (9.63% Upside) approx. December 1st 2020

**Benefits:**

As of Wednesday, 04/07, Walmart is the lowest risk retail conglomerate and is priced at a multiple less than its direct competitors including Target and Walmart. Walmart is currently in the midst of a transition to eCommerce which has not yet been sufficiently reflected in its Market Capitalization.

**Competitor Analysis:**

[**https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp**](https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp)

**Conclusion:**

A conservative P/E ratio of 40 would bring Walmart in line with its three top competitors. This computes a 36% P/E ratio increase. This P/E would result in an increased EPS of $9.87/share; in line with Costco and slightly higher than Target. Adjusted Market Capitalization to offset this P/E increase can conservatively be estimated at 25%. A fair valuation for Walmart can then be computed at a Market Capitalization of $500B. Translated to cost per share, a sell price of $176.93 can be computed.

**Debrief:**

In the coming year, the most important metrics to watch in Walmart’s financial statements will continue to be Revenue, and P/E Ratio. Also important is Walmart’s net income which will be the star of the show as a turnaround in this financial datum will likely result in an increased price per share.","['BBY', 'KR', 'WMT', 'DIS', 'AMZN']"

Initial thoughts I had were that you can compare a company to similar companies - e.g. UberEats to Deliveroo and JustEat - and assess whether the value of the company is what you'd expect for a company in that company class with its EBITDA, revenue, profit, and qualitative markers such as brand visibility or culture.

I would use this method to invest in stocks in a company that I deem undervalued. So is this roughly the way to go? What other indicators are useful? And where can one find the relevant information?

This post was inspired by another which claimed that although Coinbase is impressive and has a positive outlook, the poster thought is was 3x overvalued. Interested to understand what sort of reasoning leads to this conclusion, since many use the simplistic heuristic 'If I like X, then X is undervalued' followed up by '\*positive features of X'.",

# Bullish reasoning:

&#x200B;

[I don't know any technical mumbo-jumbo, but here's the chart, earnings is in May or June](https://imgur.com/a/digYMew)

*You must see all the images to understand my DD, I don't know why reddit messed up my formatting*

Earnings will be beaten handsomely by STMP, as COVID hasn't really subsumed. Plus, the stock has a pretty big future considering the slow but sure shift to online sales.

# Bear points:

1. The moat is not necessarily the strongest, management has to continually deliver to keep on growing. I am fairly confident that they can do it. But you may not be.

2. Too conservative management. You can easily see this from their non-existent debt and huge cash position.

3. Too low volume. Float is also only 18M. Options bid-ask spread is wild.

[Options OI and volume](https://imgur.com/a/HXp7Omf)

4. It's kinda a deep value stock. There must be some reason which I am not seeing why it remains in this deep value territory. Private equity/activist fund sharks could target it, take it private and then DPO/IPO it  at 10 times the valuation; but being almost 90% owned by various institutions, reduces this risk.

5.

&#x200B;

[So, nothing can be definitively said about the stock seeing its product reviews because most of the time, only the frustrated customers would bother to review in TrustPilot](https://imgur.com/a/QpPymkH)

**Common question: Why did the stock drop so much in 2019 and stuff?**

Answer: They had an exclusivity deal with USPS where they got a lot of money for that deal. But management intentionally dropped it as USPS couldn't make 2 day delivery or the fast delivery requirements that is necessary to compete.

The market reacted very badly for this short-term bump in the road. But COVID-19 has proved that management was right all along and it was absolutely necessary to drop that deal to grow the company.

**Conclusion:** I think the stock will pretty reliably beat the upcoming earning and the stock will jump heavily before the earnings only to dump a little or a lot after the earnings. Basically, buy the rumour, sell... 
However, the stock is also a pretty decent one for long term holdings too.
Multiples are attractive keeping the growth in mind, and add to that the possibility of positive surprises from international expansion and probable acquisitions. If no acquisition occurs, the cash could get returned to shareholders through buybacks, which would be awesome too.

**TL;DR: STMP will at least reach $270+ before earnings come out. My crystal ball says so. Plus, long term trend is sales moving online more and more, helping STMP in the process.**","['WMT', 'UPS', 'AMZN', 'BLL', 'EBAY']"

mr8uih,,stocks,post,1618467052,"A little help with options?So I been using options the last month or so maybe two. I have made some nice profits I've taken $100 and turned it into $1,000 in a couple days.

I seem to stick to the same stocks, apple, MU, Snap and recently nio. 

So I'm just here to see if I'm doing things wrong. I usually buy calls or puts.

Typically I'll stay in the money with my stock choice. So for example if I see apple is at $132 I'll buy a call for 132.50 or so. 

Now my question is I see people buying out of the money calls and making money as well. Like apple is $132 right I'll see people buying $136 calls and making money. 

I'm not sure how that part works I do know the premiums are cheaper the higher up you go  and the closer you get to in the money the more you pay for a premium.

For example that 136 call might be $60 as opposed to the $132.50 that would be $140.

How do you typically play out your calls? Anything I should be doing different? I can make nice profits but once I get over a grand I blow.mt account up. I've done it twice off of $100.

Should I start switching stocks? 
Am I looking for high implied volatility? How do you find your options plays? I'm looking to expand my knowledge.","['AAPL', 'MU']"
mr8uih,gukvuxy,stocks,comment,1618469477,"First, stick with the same few tickets so you aren’t trying to juggle 30 balls when you’re only capable of juggling 5. 

Second, options only really make money when volatility is higher than expected. Technically guessing the direction right should negate this for a little bit, but when Apple is +-.5% or less for the week, you will be losing money on your options even if you got the direction correct because the implied move may have been 1%. 

Third, keep your bets or risk amounts the same. It’s so easy to go from $100 to $1000, increase your bet amount to $500 and lose two in a row and be broke again. If you keep your bets at $100, you now need to lose 10 in a row to be broke. 

Fourth, find some system, or indicators, that you have backtested and determined to be a winning strategy, and use that to make your bets. You may have turned $100 into $1000 by blind luck, but that won’t continue. Find a system. A good one that is easy to backtest is volume. Use a daily candle and look at large spikes of volume and what happens to a stock after a 200% increase in volume. Set up a scanner that uses that or whatever else you find/learn to make your own custom strategy. Then make option plays based off that. 

Fifth, set stop losses. You’re likely to lose a few here shortly, and it’s better to lose 40% of a trade than it is to let the thing ride and lose 100%. If your system is 70% accurate, you are 30% wrong. Set a limit for how much you are going to let your wrong bets lose.",['AAPL']

mr8uih,gul6ypd,stocks,comment,1618480520,"If AAPL is $132, $132.50 is OTM. It's only $0.50 but that could make a huge difference depending on DTE. If you're buying weeklies for example, and AAPL drops 2% from $132, your $132.50 will drop more. 2% will increase IV, but the loss from the movement and theta will negate the IV bump since it's so close to expiry. 35-40+ DTE, the effects will be less.

It sounds like from your comments in the thread you started with $100, made $500 on one good trade, and $400 elsewhere. That's not bad, but not enough to say your doing well either. Buying options is just gambling and one wrong move will mean large losses. If you have 5 open positions worth $100 each, you could lose 25% of your account value in an hour or 2. Spreads are better for limiting downside risk in my opinion, but are harder to understand, build, and manage effectively.

The farther OTM you go, the bigger the gamble that it will be profitable. Buying ITM options is simply using leverage to control more shares of the underlying with less capital than holding the underlying itself. Leverage can result in a 10x gain in a few days, and a wiped account as well. $1000 isn't much to worry about long term, but depending on your income it could be months before you could save that again so idk.

I'd paper trade spreads if you want to make money guessing which direction a stock will move. I traded a call debit spread on a stock I can't list here assuming, incorrectly, that it would go up with the COIN DPO. It dropped 15% in one day. The individual long contract lost 25% ($350), but my spread is only down about $190. Max gain is $575, loss is $590. I have 15 DTE left so I'm ok holding with the volatility. If I purchased a single naked call, I'd be out of the trade with a loss of $350 in about 3 hours.","['AAPL', 'DTE']"

mr8md0,,stocks,post,1618465960,"Does Theta even matter if you plan to exercise a call?So I think I figured out how Theta works. You basically lose value on your call option everyday since the closer you get to the expiration date without being ITM, the riskier it is thus lowering it's value. However, if you planned to exercise the contract then would it matter at all? I'm considering buying a LEAP GME contract, but I'm new to options and don't want to get rekt by some unforeseen problem. AFAIK, the biggest concern is Theta and something called IV crush. Though, IV crush seems to be of less concern to me since I'm very bullish on GME and IMO it's pretty likely GME will remain volatile till the squeeze happens (assuming it does). I think Theta shouldn't be too big of a problem either, since the contract is quite long (Jan 2023). Any technical problems with this LEAP play besides personal opinions on the bullishness of GME? Is some other factor about options going to come out of nowhere and destroy me?",
mr8md0,gukxehs,stocks,comment,1618470898,"well I'd say be careful or please don't do this but...

let's say you get the 950 strike '23 LEAP for $2525. I'm thinking the basic nature of your question means you can't afford much more, and if you could, I don't know why you would choose gme at this point, but I digress... Stonk just had a big day 30% gain on contract, so if you buy now and it falls back, you can quickly lose 30% value or more in a flash. no big deal you have time to recover, right?

Theta won't start hurting until you're 60-45 days out from expiration, and then it ramps up quickly, losing more and more value each day. So you'd have from now until Halloween '22 before you have to worry about that. But if on that date GME is at $500, and after 2 years the IV dropped (.77 Vega!), that contract will not be very valuable.

If you were to exercise, then you need to be ITM and have $95,000 on hand to purchase the shares. And GME needs to be at 975 for you to profit. 

Imo, best hope is that you buy right before or intraday during a big run and get out just as quickly. If you're thinking far OTM Leaps are a cheaper way to bag hold I think you'll end up disappointed. 

I've been wrong before, though. Good luck!",

mr8md0,guksp53,stocks,comment,1618466716,"You absolutely can get IV crushed on a LEAP

And yes Theta does matter


If your stock (GME) doesn't make any significant movements towards the strike, the LEAP will slowly bleed Theta over time.  While you may intend to exercise the call, if you ever need liquidity you may not be able to exit the position at a favorable valuation.

Secondly, you need to compare the extrinsic and intrinsic value of your LEAP.  GME has very high IV, so it's likely your LEAP will have a significant amount of IV priced in.

If the implied volatility of GME falls, it'll affect your LEAP as well.  As of today, it looks like the Jan2023 LEAPs (>.85 delta) are pricing GME @$200 or so.  

So take that as you will.  Good luck",
mr8md0,gukso0n,stocks,comment,1618466690,"You will absolutely get crushed opening a leap call on GME. Volatility plays a huge role in option pricing...and has a great impact on leaps. I haven’t checked the latest volatility reading for GME but I’m fairly certain it’s still through the roof.

Look at it this way: At the money contracts in both TSLA ($723) and GME ($166) have very similar prices! There’s a $557 difference in the underlying yet contract premiums are comparable. This should be a big indicator that GME contracts are factoring in tons of volatility. 

Before opening any leaps I would suggest fully understanding the Greeks, volatility and how they impact option premium. Look into IVPercentile/IVRank as a way to determine when’s a good time to open leaps (or any option position in general)

EDIT: After going over your post again you definitely need a crash course in options. 

Intrinsic value = options value if you exercised contract (ie: $20call on XYZ trading @ $25 would have 5.00 of intrinsic value)

Extrinsic value = options value derived from time and volatility 

If you are buying an out of the money option you are buying 100% extrinsic value because it has no intrinsic value. LEAPS have a low theta because there is so much time but it’s important to know that you are buying 100% time value when buying an out of the money leap.",['TSLA']

# Ford’s ‘Mother of All Road Trips’ Tests BlueCruise Hands-Free Driving Ahead of Over-the-Air Push to F-150, Mustang Mach-E

  

* Following 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford embarked on a  110,000-mile “Mother of All Road Trips” across the United States and  Canada to prove out BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology in a  wide range of driving and weather conditions
* 2021 Ford F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with the available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package can receive BlueCruise later this year through over-the-air software update.    
 
* BlueCruise will give drivers the comfort and confidence of  hands-free driving on prequalified sections of divided highways called  Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up more than 100,000 miles of North  American roads  
 
* Additional Ford vehicles to receive BlueCruise technology in coming  years as Ford continues to add additional highways and deliver new  hands-free driving capabilities to F-150, Mustang Mach-E and more

**DEARBORN, Mich., April 14, 2021** – Ford will begin offering its  new BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system to customers later  this year after 500,000 miles of development testing and fine-tuning the  technology on a journey across the United States and Canada.

Last year, Ford sent a fleet of 10 test vehicles – five F-150 pickups  and five all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs – to complete what test  drivers dubbed the “Mother of All Road Trips.” The trek covered more  than 110,000 miles through 37 states and five Canadian provinces to  challenge BlueCruise against a wide range of road, weather and traffic  conditions.

“There are highway intricacies and driving conditions that you simply  cannot replicate in a lab,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford chief product  platform and operations officer. “Sending these vehicles out for  real-world driving experience is just one of many ways we ensured that  BlueCruise technology offers confidence and convenience for drivers all  across the continent.”  

Via over-the-air software updates, BlueCruise will be offered later  this year on 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E models equipped with the  available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package.  Over-the-air software updates allow owners of select Ford vehicles to  update software from the convenience of their own garage.

Ford is targeting to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with  BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate  projections.

**Mother of All Road Trips becomes the ultimate Ford test drive**

All 10 test vehicles – one departing from Palo Alto, California, the  others from Dearborn, Michigan – spent much of last November and  December winding their way across the United States and Canada. Test  drivers searched for every conceivable road condition and highway  driving scenario, monitoring the system’s performance, collecting data  and highlighting areas where improvements could be made.

The trip marked the final leg of a development process that ran up  more than a half-million miles in a series of shorter test drives, each  designed to evaluate a specific aspect of BlueCruise. As real-world  validation of those earlier tests, road trip enabled the system to scan  for variances in road signage, lane markings, exit ramps, traffic  patterns and weather.

“I drive long-distance quite often, whether out to Boston or down to  Florida to visit family or friends, and usually I mentally tire out on  drives that far,” said Alexandra Taylor, BlueCruise feature development  engineer, who logged more than 3,000 miles in an F-150 on the trek. “The  one thing that became clear is that, when using BlueCruise, long drives  aren’t nearly as mentally taxing to me.”

Taylor and fellow BlueCruise engineer Shruti Gotadki set out on an  eight-day journey that wound through the southeast United States,  targeting driving differences between Jacksonville, Louisville, Atlanta  and other major urban areas.

Back at the Ford lab, driver-assist technology supervisor Justin  Teems monitored the progress of the entire fleet, corralling important  data that will help shape BlueCruise driving experience in the months  and years ahead.

“It was like mission control,” Teems said. “We really wanted to push  BlueCruise to its limits. Every state builds roads a little differently.  When you include factors like lane line degradation, weather and  construction, building a hands-free driving system becomes extremely  complex. Those complexities are why Ford has the best team of engineers  in the world working on it.”

**BlueCruise, the evolution of Ford Co-Pilot360 Technology**

Using both advanced camera and radar-sensing technologies and  building upon Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane  Centering and Speed Sign Recognition, BlueCruise adds a new level of  convenience for drivers with vehicles equipped with Ford Co-Pilot360  Technology. The feature allows a driver to operate truly hands-free on  prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones. A  driver-facing camera in the instrument cluster monitors eye gaze and  head position to help ensure the driver’s eyes remain on the road.

Currently, more than 100,000 miles of highways across North America  are dedicated Hands-Free Blue Zones in the Ford GPS mapping system.  BlueCruise uses blue lighting on the digital instrument cluster to  indicate when the vehicle is in a hands-free zone.

In addition to the full hands-free mode, equipped vehicles will also  feature Lane Centering mode. Lane Centering works on most roads with  lane lines and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane but  requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. In either  mode, a visual prompt on the instrument cluster notifies drivers when  they need to return their attention to the road or resume control of the  vehicle.

BlueCruise is an SAE Level 2 driver-assist technology, similar to  Tesla Autopilot but with the advantage of offering a true hands-free  driving experience while in Hands-Free Mode that does not require a  driver’s hands to stay in contact with the steering wheel, unless  prompted by vehicle alerts.

And unlike other approaches – such as GM’s Super Cruise, which uses  red and green lighting, or Tesla’s Autopilot, which requires a driver  keep their hands on the steering wheel – BlueCruise communicates with  drivers in different ways. The instrument cluster transitions to  communicate that the feature is in Hands-Free mode through text and blue  lighting cues, effective even for those with color blindness.

**More highways and features to come**

Beyond the 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E, additional Ford  vehicles will also receive BlueCruise hands-free driving technology,  while current owners continue to receive over-the-air software updates  to add new features and capabilities in the coming years.

Future enhancements are planned to include Lane Change Assist that  will let the vehicle change lanes with just a tap of the turn signal  indicator, and Predictive Speed Assist that will adjust vehicle speed  for road curves, roundabouts and more.

Ford also plans to offer regular mapping updates for the technology  to recognize changes plus thousands of miles of planned new road  additions.

**Affordable** **hands-free highway driving technology**

2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E customers will be able to purchase  BlueCruise software – including a three-year service period – for $600  in the second half of 2021, when it’s ready to launch. Hardware pricing  varies by vehicle.

For F-150, BlueCruise is available as a part of the Ford Co-Pilot 360  Active 2.0 package for a total of $1,595 – $600 for the software and  $995 for the hardware. The Ford Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package is  standard on F-150 Limited and available as an option on Lariat, King  Ranch and Platinum models.

For Mustang Mach-E, BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium  and First Edition variants. It’s an available package on the Select trim  for $3,200 – $ 600 for the software and $2,600 for the rest of the  package – as part of the larger Comfort and Technology package, which  includes features such as a 360-degree camera, heated front seats and  heated steering wheel.

Sometimes they're wrong but as they're saying, the perfect catalyst is there and not enough people are talking about it.

My gut is saying that we'll see stock market mayhem sometime in June. So I should buy now just in case it happens in May.

Did you buy Coinbase's DPO, or any of the IPOs last year?As an investor I often find it hard to not jump on board when these big companies plan on going public. Last year we saw a record breaking amount of companies IPO/DPO (480 on the US Stock exchange alone). This year, already over 200 companies have gone public. Of course we are in a bit of a bull run, so when the market overall looks good, companies use that because they will do a better job of getting people excited. It's hard not to get caught up in that. 

I found myself reading about all of these companies going public, most notably airbnb and snowflake and ended up getting caught up in the hype and buying in, when really I hadn't planned to. I evidently ended up getting burned, but it's taught me quite a big life lesson.

You're talking about Boeing though, not Chuck E Cheese.      

Boeing may be a great long term investment, but it definitely isn't some re-opening play. Boeing has two main sources of income:    

 - USG/Military contracts (aircraft, space, missiles, etc): 36%~.       
 - Commercial aviation: 50%~

Some of their commercial aviation sales are completely unimpacted (e.g. freight) from travel slowdowns/airline profits. The problem is that you're running with the theory that COVID over means an immediate jump in sales, and that Boeing starts pushing aircraft out immediately. That won't be the case.      

Problem is that COVID disrupted suppliers, supplies, and staff/factories, plus there is a global chip shortage, and of course the 737 Max is an ongoing nightmare for them. So even when COVID is over, it isn't over-over, you'll have months of lag on the back-end and also airlines who have built up tons of debt who may try to delay replacing their aging fleet just a little longer than they had planned to (even if it is less fuel efficient they can push back costs they cannot afford today until tomorrow).   

I'm bullish on Boeing to be clear, but calls specifically require a date, and I don't know the date. Your theory about this is so thin neither do you. Boeing as a play is super complicated, and a lot of it is about looking at their externalities (suppliers, international trade, customers, etc).",['BA']

mr5pze,,stocks,post,1618453734,"Question regarding buying long options vs buying shares***Obligatory new to options.***

I was weighing the risk and reward of simply buying $1400 worth of GME shares, or buying a call option with a strike of $900 and an expiration of around mid January 2022. I figure, there's a pretty dang good chance the squeeze is squoze this year. Is there any major disadvantage to buying a call option with an expiration that is so far out? Obviously there's Theta decay, but the way I understand it Theta decay isn't a big deal until the expiration date is close (like 90 days is what I've seen.). Is this correct, or am I missing something? Would I get rekt by Theta if I did this? A 900c GME option with an expiration of January 2022 is about $1253. The Theta on a 900c right now is like 0.10, so how bad would it get as time went on?",
mr5pze,gukdf74,stocks,comment,1618456142,there's a high probability you lose the 1400,

mr5pze,gukbyf2,stocks,comment,1618455309,"This is literally the equivalent of throwing money in water.

First, GME will not reach $900 next January, anyone telling you it will is stupid.

Second, GME is an extreme volatile stock with insane IV, so the best way to profit is actually on the other end of calls.

Third, if you only have $1400 and would like to gamble on far OTM option, VTI $265c Jan 2022 is less than $80 per contract, and I think the chance VTI reach $265 is much much higher than GME reach $800.",
mr5pze,gukur7h,stocks,comment,1618468491,"Other people have mentioned this, but don't do this!

The option won't behave in a way that you probably expect.

If you own the shares you'll have a gain as long as the shares go up.  If you buy the 900 strike option, it might not print at all.  if GME goes to only $800 by Jan 2022, your option will be worthless while your shares are nearly 5x more.

Also, it's possible for a squeeze to take months or years to happen.  TSLA for example.  If you're wrong on the timing then you've just thrown away money you could have spent on shares.",['TSLA']
mr5pze,guka6nm,stocks,comment,1618454346,"I’m very bullish on GME right now so don’t take this the wrong way but if you buy a $900 strike price call you will lose all your money guaranteed. That’s over 1 thousand dollars you’ll literally give to whoever sells it to you. Wait for a big dip (it’s coming) and buy the shares or a deep in the money call that expires that week or the next. It’s so volatile right now it not worth the risk.

mquzay,,stocks,post,1618419865,"Sprouts Farmers Market $SFM DDHello, so this is my first dd post on reddit, and it'll be on Sprouts, a supermarket chain that specializes on healthy products and produce that i recently initiated a position in.

Recent events:

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

Share buybacks: 20% of outstanding shares have already been bought back and recently they were authorized to buy back $300m worth of shares.

Multiples:

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

TTM Revenues: 6.47b (55 per share), with about 4.5% profit margins.

Forward eps estimates(# of analysts):

2021: 1.86 (7)

2022: 2.05 (7)

2023: 2.57 (2)

2024: 3.16 (1)

2024 estimate seems ambitious but if they can achieve that it would be \~12% annualized growth from 2021 to 2024

Discounted cash flow: This is my first time using reddit charts so it'll be overly simplified and i'll try to be conservative with the estimates and i won't capitalize their leases, feel free to do your own as grocery chains are fairly easy to value compared to other industries, and if you i would appreciate a lot if you can share ($, in millions)

mr93t9,,stocks,post,1618468344,"DD on fast growing fintech - KSPI.IL (one of ARKF's stock picks)I’d like to share thesis on [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) ([KSPI.IL](https://kspi.il/)), the largest Payments, Marketplace and Fintech Ecosystem in Kazakhstan with a leading market share in each of its key services and products. At the core of its Ecosystem is the [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, the leading mobile app in the country with 4.9 million DAU (up 155% YoY) and 9.1 million MAU (up 59% YoY), which is roughly half of the country population. The app serves as a single gateway to all of the Company’s services and is an integral part of people’s daily lives in Kazakhstan. As people’s lives become increasingly digitalized [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) expects the usage of its Super App to grow, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating consumer adoption of cashless payments, e-Commerce and digital financial services. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) is built around an ecosystem business model, where the growth and development of one service contributes to the growth and development of other services, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. A growing number of services being used by the Company’s consumers results in synergies across all of its Platforms, structurally high profitability and creates a powerful self-reinforcing network effect, giving the Company strong competitive advantages.

According to the recent Full-Year 20202 Financial Results, total revenue reached KZT641,437 M (\~$1.5B), equivalent to adj. 25.5% YoY growth; and net income reached KZT274,318 M (\~$0.65B), equivalent to net income 42.8% margin and 43.2% YoY growth.

**The** [**Kaspi.kz**](https://kaspi.kz/) **Ecosystem currently comprises the following three market leading Platforms:**

• Payments Platform connects customers, which consist of both consumers and merchants, to facilitate cashless, digital payment transactions. The Company offers its customers a technology platform to both pay and receive payments for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw money. Consumers can transact with merchants and amongst themselves using a variety of services, including the [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, a Kaspi Gold pre-paid debit card and/or any bank card or e-Wallet.

In 2020, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/)’s proprietary payment network transactions accounted for 66% of total payment network transactions in Kazakhstan, while other payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, had an aggregate share of 34% of the total payment network transactions in the country. With close ties to Kazakhstan’s government, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) has also emerged as the country’s unofficial national online bank for paying taxes and fines, assuming a role that would otherwise be filled by the civil service or a government department, and further driving new user growth across the country.

• Marketplace Platform connects merchants and consumers, enabling merchants to increase their sales and enabling consumers to buy a broad selection of products and services from a variety of online and offline merchants. The Company helps merchants increase their sales by linking them to its technology, payment options, including buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products, fulfilment, marketing and branding services.

[Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) was the largest online retailer in Kazakhstan by sales value in 2020, with an e-Commerce gross merchandise value (“GMV”) share corresponding to 46% of the market.

• Fintech Platform enables consumers to access, primarily through [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, the Company’s digital finance products, including consumer finance and deposits. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/)’s buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products are also strategically integrated with its Marketplace Platform, which means that consumers are able to make a purchase seamlessly with financing and then pay over time in monthly instalments.

In 2020 the Company enjoyed the largest market share of Consumer Loans in Kazakhstan, amounting to 32%.

[**Kaspi.kz**](https://kaspi.kz/)**’s Future**

• [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Travel. In 2020, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) acquires Santufei and launches online travel platform. Users can now purchase domestic and international flights from over 700 airlines through the app. Over time [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) plans to expand into ground transportation, hotels and package holidays.

• Speed and Risk Management. Credit decisions made in only 10 secs, and time to money 15 mins based on machine learning driven real-time decision making based on historic online data collected by [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) and data purchased from third parties. The second type focuses on the client’s activity immediately preceding the application with the aim of assessing intent to buy. What client did on their phone one minute ago tells you a lot. These checks significantly reduced the risk of fraud. ATM network has face-recognition technology to detect fraudulent activity on the spot. Customers who entered their national identity number or displayed the QR code to the ATM could make any transaction without a plastic card.

• Growth via the Merchant Segment. The merchant network gave [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) another avenue for expansion. The company had daily contact with merchants, both online and offline. Around one third of all merchants’ sales were realized through its marketplace. It could easily provide services to its merchant base including payment services and capital financing tools. Capitalizing on its advanced analytical tools, the company was also able to provide merchants access to sophisticated marketing tools that they could not afford on their own.

• Geographic Expansion. Central Asia and the Caucasus was a natural expansion area for [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/). Russian was spoken throughout the region, and they shared a common culture. Mr. Lomtadze estimated that establishing a presence in any country in the region would take no more than 12 months because [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) had a natural advantage: almost everything it offered was online in its mobile app, so they were able to enter the market with a marketplace or payments platform, which required no investment in physical outlets, posed no credit risks, and was not heavily regulated like financial services. Banks, on the other hand, would normally enter a market with loans, and they needed branches. Payments were also a tool for collecting customer data that then could be used for generating a credit rating for consumer financing decisions. “Our mobile app is like Uber,” Lomtadze declared. “Uber can scale around the world because of its simple onboarding process. In today's world, you don’t really need to own a fleet of cars to provide taxi services. By the same token, you don't have to have a showroom and a warehouse full of TVs to sell televisions. You can basically organize everything through technology and sell items via your mobile app.”

o Azerbaijan was the first target. In the beginning of 2018, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) was eyeing a potential acquisition target in the country that owned three leading online marketplaces for—new and used items, cars, and real estate. Out of its 10 million citizens, almost half live in the capital city. That’s great for fulfillment. An acquisition here would expand target market from 18 to 28 million overnight.

o For the same reasons Uzbekistan and Georgia attractive markets as well.

• In terms of existing models, Alibaba is closest to [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) in terms of the range of products it offers and its multiple contact points with customers. The company, in addition to its mobile app, captured customers in its outlets, ATMs, merchant shops, and retailers’ points of sale. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) had also been generating net profit for over a decade. Its net profitability was 43%, over seven times more than Amazon’s and about three times greater than that of PayPal.

Baring Vostok, a private equity fund and a majority stake holder, had a long holding period; and recent IPO and subsequent lockup period would allow it to commence a formal exit. The subsequent lockup period ends on April 18th, 2021.

mqthm0,,stocks,post,1618415650,Stocks don't move based on merit?Like many other folks I started investing last year during quarantine. This correction was a real learning experience. I used to think stocks moved on news and merit. Now I see just how much it moves based on what's trending for big money. A stock can suddenly dip 10% - 15% even though it hasn't reported any negative news. This was eye opening.,

mqthm0,guicitq,stocks,comment,1618420992,"1. Keep the context in mind.  You've been investing for a very short time in one of the noisiest periods in recent history.

2. The best saying about the market is ""In the short-run it's a voting machine, but in the long run it's a weighing machine"" ... If you're only looking at the wiggles on a day to day bases over a short horizon, things look crazy ... In general they're not ... Successful companies grow and unsuccessful companies don't. 

3. Finally and most interestingly, I suggest you look into Mike Green and his theory of the impact of passive investing.  Very interesting and suggests that companies are decoupling from ""merit"" as they're buoyed up by mindless passive dollars

Good luck!",

mqymst,,stocks,post,1618430239,"Total return swapstl;dr: Please explain the effect of a loss in the underlying to a total return swap (e.g. the cashflows)

&#x200B;

I'm trying to understand total return swaps and I think I get the gist of it but I don't get what happens if the underlying (e.g. a Stock)  returns a loss, because (and please correct me if I'm wrong) 

a swap is basically that parties 1 and 2 have an agrement where party 1 pays party 2 a fixed percentage rate of a base of X $ and party 2 pays party 1 the percentage return of an underlying (e.g. AAPL stock) of the same base X.

if the underlying outperforms the fixed rate, party 1 makes money and if the underlying underperforms the fixed rate, party 2 makes money 

&#x200B;

>consider that rather than appreciating, the S&P 500 falls by 15%. The first party would receive 15% in addition to the LIBOR rate plus the fixed margin, and the payment netted to the first party would be $205,000, or \[$1 million x (15% + 5.5%)\].

this is what investopedia says happens if the underlying doesn't just underperform but realises losses. If I get this right in my example party 2 would get the fixed rate it would get anyways but also gets those 15% losses it had because it holds the underlying, therefore he doesn't have a loss. but then this seems to defeat the purpose of the total return swap to relieve party 1 of the risk of holding the underlying.","['AAPL', 'SPGI']"

Most of the time the other party will buy it as a hedge and collect some fees for holding it and giving you access to the margin.

You're looking at CEFs typically because

* Dividends (probably)
* Price
* Underlying asset class (probably not)

The premium is indeed something to look at, but by that logic, we'd avoid companies that never turned a profit (high P/E) and typically choose laggards (little to no premium).  

I'd flip the above bullet points in reverse, focusing on the CEFs that are holding assets that I would want to hold, a price that is affordable (compared to the NAV) and then the dividends.

mr3yfu,,stocks,post,1618447183,"Disney ($DIS): Disney is the most undervalued company and deserves so much more hype**Before I start**, I love the Walt Disney Company, I am extremely bullish on the stock as well, it is my largest holding at around $5k. I bought it after Corona hit in March and I have a very low cost per share average ($110). I also have my entire family bought in over my understanding of the company.

&#x200B;

**Disney+:** Crushing subscriber projections, Disney+ has found itself in second place in the massive streaming wars. I see a time where Netflix loses its touch and Disney can quickly fill that spot because of their massively known product base. Disney isn't afraid of acquisitions as well, Disney has acquired Lucasfilms and Marvel, and they have an invested relationship with Pixar. They want to own your favorite movie and soon it will be on Disney Plus. Disney Plus has also subsidized the companies loss throughout Corona. 

**Disney Theme Parks:** Disney finds itself in the number one destination for tourism and theme park visits. These properties, theme parks, hotels, restaurants, etc, are constantly being improved and changed to bring in a rotating freshness to all attractions. This refreshing feature of the park allows for revisitation. The constant expansion of the theme parks and their attractions just allows for longer stay time which means more money. Disney's theme parks mainly rely on merchandise for profits, the brand that Disney has built led to endless demand. They have parks in California, Florida, China, France, Tokyo, all of which have the same refresh equation as I mentioned before. 

**Disney Cruises:** Disney Cruises are some of the most profitable ships that sail the seas. Right now the stock is at $187 dollars per share with their entire four-ship fleet docked. Not to mention that Disney has announced and partially built one out of the two new ships. This is a department of Disney that has not even reached 1% of its fullest potential. Disney will have exponential growth in their cruising department as time goes on. They keep information close to the chest when it comes to fleet expansion but I have the understanding that their fleet will continue to grow.

**Disney Media Companies:** Simply put, Disney owns so much. I previously mentioned the endless unlimited universe of Star Wars and Marvel, but they own IPs like Avatar, and media companies like ABC, portions of Fox, ESPN, etc. These companies, names, and movies are bricks of gold for them. They are wrapped and finished products, that pay them dividends in things like merchandise and toys.  It's amazing that they design many characters to be useful in milking all the money out of them. 

**Disney Innovation:** Honestly the level of quality that goes into a Disney project is amazing. It is undervalued almost (same as their stock price). I have picked up on what one of their latest projects really is. Disney is inventing a new type of vacation. Disney is building a spaceship-themed hotel. Not only is it themed as a Star Wars spaceship. It is immersive. You get off the airport and walk to the busses. You see a themed section of the airport owned by Disney. You board the bus which is themed on the inside as a spaceship (the driver is a robot, the actual driver is hidden), the windows on the inside are screens. You think you're in a real spaceship. You arrive at this very expensive 5-night hotel and are loaded in and the hotel has no real windows. It makes you think you are in this space station. 

**VIDEO:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DUCDKxXeFg&ab\_channel=DSNYNewscast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DUCDKxXeFg&ab_channel=DSNYNewscast)

This is **NOT** a hotel, this is a stationary cruise type model. Which is so much better than an actual cruise. Their cruises are so profitable, but they spend so much on maintenance, staff, government regulation, etc. By making a practical cruise-type experience on land is brilliant. Not just brilliant, but this will print money for the company in the near future. They will build multiple of these Galactic Star Cruisers but with different experiences (just like their cruises that are slightly different to encourage numerous trips). 

**Disney Brand:** Disney is obviously a family brand. You know you could pick up any movie, and if it had the Disney stamp of approval you could trust it with the kid. This trait in their brand is so valuable and I feel like no one gives it credit. 

**Why buy Disney:** Disney manufactures happiness. And that is an untouched market, only occupied by Disney. They have a cult-like fanbase that is so brand loyal. At their current price point, they are a massive buy and I am intending the do a couple of calls at certain strikes. They were also given numerous price changes which resulted in their stock getting predictions from $217-$223. I think there is not only a good value trade here, but there are long-term growth and recovery showing in their earnings. Their next quarter comes out on 5/13/21 and the stock is always responsive to improvements in the finances. I can see improvement in the finances because more parks are open which cuts their losses. 

&#x200B;

TL:DR: Disney is a major buy at this price still, price analysts have upgraded the stock to a target of $217-$223. They manufacture happiness and hold brands that yield so much capital in return. Their projects are only going to expand and grow, and that's why I love Disney $DIS .

mqbg6o,,stocks,post,1618347565,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 13, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 13, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) gaining while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly. Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season.

In a joint statement posted to Twitter [(check out the thread here](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778)), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.”

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

**Highlights**

* Earnings season is kicking off Wednesday pre-market, with many big banks reporting earnings.

“S&P DJI is proposing to implement the previously described methodology changes, if adopted, in conjunction with the upcoming rebalancing, which takes effect prior to the market open on Monday, April 19, 2021.”

I don’t have a lump sum amount to deposit, I’m just looking for something to contribute to with each paycheck. I’m not paying student loans right now due to the interest freeze so I could contribute $400-$500 a month probably. 

I’m a 27 year old man who lives in Ohio. I just got a raise and make $17.50 an hour which is around like 36.5k I think per year but after bonuses and OT I make in the low 40s. My fiancée is 23 F and makes $13 an hour. We both have bachelor degrees.

We don’t own a house yet, but that’s a goal within the next couple years. I live in a LCOL area so we could buy a modest home for around 150k-200k. 

I have 2k in savings, $400 in a HSA and 6.5k in my 401k. I recently started contributing 12% of my check and my company contributes 3%. The company I work for also has a pension plan which I’m 1.5 years away from being fully vested in. My fiancée also has about 2k in savings. She owes 3k on her car which will be paid off soon. My car is paid off and we don’t have credit card debt. 

I added $100 to my robinhood account on 2/23/21 just to experiment with and as of right now it’s at $257.09 already. This quick gain has gotten me more interested in investing but not sure where to start for safer, long term investments and I’d like to put my money somewhere else other than robinhood. I don’t have specific goals in mind, I just absolutely loathe working and want to retire at a decent age. That’s the goal I guess.

mrhrgv,,investing,post,1618502557,"Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well.","['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'PYPL']"

5 EV startups projected they'll hit $10b in revenue faster than Google, the current record holder for fastest to $10b.

Canoo touted a subscription model, an engineering services business, and a partnership with Hyundai.  On their first earnings call, they announced the Hyundai deal was dead, they were transitioning to developing IP for their own products (ie engineering services is dead), and that their subscription model wasn't actually financially viable.  And their CFO left.  One analyst asked if their CEO was still employed in the Q&A (lol).

Lordstown got caught juicing pre-orders.  BREAKING:  Steve Burns is still a hack.  This one shouldn't have surprised anyone...

Multiplan gave projections out to 2025 in the first half of 2020, before they merged.  As a public company, they gave no guidance for 2021 in their Q4 earnings call.

mre9dz,guly1t9,investing,comment,1618497635,"I’d never even heard of Scorpion Capital (looks like they’re a pretty small player), but they don’t seem to have a good track record on their “reports.” In fact, if you read the small print on their reports, it says that they are “short QuantumScape and therefore stands to realize significant gains in the event that the price of its stock... decline.” It also says they “intend on continuing to transact in QS’s stock.”

So a small outfit with an iffy track record posts a ridiculously long report with opinions of “former employee #1” and so forth.

I think we are where we were before. QuantumScape is an incredibly speculative play that has goals it may or may not reach (as admitted by their management). This means it is subject to potential manipulation both by its management or by short sellers. If you were bullish before, there’s no reason to not be now. Vice versa.

mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 23 billion of revenue. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside. 

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

*Edit for investing: I had to do so much syntax wizardry to not get this insta flagged. Message me if you need any clarification*

Sorta new to posting so if I break any rules I apologize. This isn’t a CC post just a post based on the IPO of Coinbase, mods be kind, looking at you automod. 

#TLDR: I think the rise in Coinbase ($COIN currently: $348.85) is too bullish. A platform tied so closely to the performance of the C market feels destined to be highly volition and feels set up for options plays. Feels like a way to speculate on C Market, without having to enter it*

DISCLAIMER: Coinbase ($COIN) is a C currency (C market from here on out) transaction platform, not a currency, so if I get banned for using the C word. Oh well. 

DOUBLE DISCLAIMER: I currently have **no position** in $COIN. I am simply trying to see if my logic is sound of this. 

Onto the discussion. 

Currently $COIN is valued at $349 PM, up ~~21%~~ 7% *math is hard* from last nights close of $328. Which alone feels like a lot, but I think it may be boosted by the fact that ARK took a not small position on $COIN driving the price up a few points. #”Inb4 it just hit IPO let it settle.”# Well maybe but I’m too jacked and need an outlet to listen to logic. 

The reason I’m intrigued by this play is its (at least in my opinion) tied VERY closely to the C market, which idk if anyone has notices keeps hitting all time highs every week. Now whether or not you believe in a “C market bubble” (I tend to be on this side, now I’m not sure of the magnitude of the bubble but it’s due for correction this is off topic though) or if you think this is the future and C market is going to trend up linearly long term, it’s still hard to argue that the C market is pretty volatile. 

I see huge potential to swing trade, long term dip buying potential, and ESPECIALLY options plays for $COIN based on C Market volatility. Because:

1.) C Marker is 24/7 tradeable so it has 24/7 live data, would be easier to make next day plans/make market psychology plays

2.) if C market drops, I can see a non insignificant number of Coinbase users paper handing if b t c takes a big hit. This isn’t a DD but I imagine their user base has gone up significantly with the rise of C market over the last few months coupled with quarantine boredom. 
*TLDR: C market goes down = newer Coinbase users closing positions, withdrawing their left over cash, and staying away (for at least a little while). Bad for Coinbase I assume*

3.) the environmental angle, at some point, the world is going to have to address the sheer amount of energy needed to support the C market. I think it’s 100% achievable, but once regulations start cracking down I think in the short to medium-long term, it could hurt C market centric businesses. 

So my *tentative* plan is, once option trading is open
grab 100+ shares and start writing contracts based on the public sentiment. If people still seem bullish I’ll get some longer CCs going, since I’m Bearish at the current price point long term. If sentiment is similar to mine, may get some ATM puts and see what’s up. 


Anyway thanks for reading. I’m pretty new at far options plays. So feel free to annihilate my logic/understanding of basic options terms. If nothing else PLEASE let me know my flaws here. Thanks!",['PM']

All  the things I saw in their presentation are perfectly manageable if you  hire proper IT people. We don't need UI to prepare data from different  sources, link the data, run AI models etc. We can do it in days or weeks  not years like they are trying to sell you.

Maybe they will faciliate some tasks for companies without good sized or skilled IT teams, I dont' know...

Their  UI seems very interesting and well designed, I can give that. But I m  sure we will be quicker with a simple linux terminal (joke) :)

I  see their products like ""Channable"" for data flow management but with  all the AI hype (\*\*Channable is a small tool to prepare data to be sent  to shopping marketplaces).

Like I  said, maybe I don't have the full picture based on their presentation  and I don't know any figures related to their valuation etc. But for a  pure technical point, I don't see anything in the core plateform that is  a big whaooo effect (except their UI).

If  I need to think about a road : they maybe will be a 3d engine like  Unreal Engine or Unity but for data linking, preparation, and IA models  (the tool that groups up the techs in a simpler way).. but I have a  doubt.

Just a single (and possibly uninformed) perspective, but that has not been my experience working at a f100 financial services firm. We have multiple complex proprietary processing systems that we've spent tens of millions on, multiple large-scale data warehouse (each with thousands if not tens of thousands of tables), and a whole supporting cast of upstream, intermediate, and reporting systems. These systems are diverse, some proprietary, some purchased, and they have been stood up over decades. It takes our IT group many months to create or even modify integration between legacy systems. We have a small army of IT folks and have thrown an awful lot of cash at several top-tier consulting groups and none have had a magic bullet. Every RFP response promises nirvana, and all scale expectations once they open the hood understand the scale of our data issues.   

If these guys have a way to efficiently unify/link and homogenize diverse datasets, it is a very big deal and worth alot of money. Especially if they have found a way to structure unstructured data effectively, as they claim.

Related party transactions and acquisitions have been a matter of habit for the Alibaba Partnership. In April 2014, Alibaba gave Simon Xie a $1 billion loan which he used to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media5 through an entity that was jointly owned by Jack Ma and Simon Xie. Alibaba claimed that they were not able to invest in Wasu Media directly because of Chinese regulations and that investing through Mr. Xie’s entity was the only way. In fact, Alibaba has regularly invested alongside Yunfeng Capital, a Shanghai based private equity company that was established by Jack Ma in 2010. The list of such related party transactions runs long and as recently as 2019 Alibaba Pictures gave a $103 million loan to struggling film studio Huayi Brothers Media in which Jack Ma has a considerable stake6. The lines between Alibaba’s shareholder interests and Jack Ma’s personal interests are very blurry, and at odds with our philosophy of backing clean and well aligned ownership structures.

Since Alibaba’s IPO, the asset base has grown tenfold from $18 billion to $185 billion or 48% per year.

However, this asset growth has mostly been driven by acquisitions and self-reported asset revaluations. Between 2014 and 2020, Alibaba has expanded their balance sheet by $92 billion in relation to equity investments (incl. goodwill recognised). In the same period, the ROAs have dropped from 26% to 13% and ROIC has fallen from 33% to 8%.

Alibaba management justifies these acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015, Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197. Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after four years in the red8.

Some of these acquisitions are in fact so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project10.",

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US)’s first product unveiling of 2021 will take place on April 20, the company said on Tuesday.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant dubbed the event “Spring Loaded” in a media invitation. Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business.","['AAPL', 'TWTR', 'FB']"

This is why NBC’s Cramer  recently said, “There is something about Paysafe that may be the  ultimate stock for this moment.” Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso  calls for $45-50 saying, “It’s the most excited I’ve been about a stock  in a long time.” So why is that?

Updated DD:

Partnered  with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch,  Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming,  etc.

Global electronic payment  platform with integrated cloud technology offering migration of eCash,  integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into  global banking as a service (with proprietary risk management enabling  mobile e-commerce for the 1.7 billion ”unbanked.”)

$58  trillion TAM.  Fund manager Cathie Wood: “Fintechs are going to gut  banks.” Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve predicts a  “$16 trillion market cap wholesale transition” of fintechs “taking over  and revolutionizing banking”

No. 1  global leader in iGaming eCash network. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market  volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected  to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

No.  2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. Owns Neteller  and Skrill, winner “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”,  “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current  ecosystems.”

No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing

Enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies)

Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Rapidly  expanding in US with new partnerships (last 3 months: Coinbase,  Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto) & new  legalized sports betting (this month: NY, WY, NH)

Trustpilot  in Europe (where more commonly used) rates Paysafe as “Excellent”  (4.7/5 stars) with over 24,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""poor"" (1.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Bill  Foley, Paysafe's Chairman of the Board, has a proven track record in  generating rapid synergistic inorganic growth. Over the last five years  Foley has grow Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X  ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS  from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those  characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with  Paysafe.”

Foley on Paysafe: “It’s  a fortress. It’s got a moat…We have a proven strategy of winning as new  global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory  risk and technical expertise…It’s going to be a land grab…I have a  vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there  first and to make sure we dominate. We’re focusing on gaming,  particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and  we’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting.”

Analyst  coverage: “We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within  the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical  footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply  revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe  there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level  legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a  unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and  offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential  legalization of iGaming in the United States.""

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections
2. From  published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,  bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.  Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to  fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected  10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

Recent signals of Blackstone/CVC’s long-term hold:

Last  week, Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said “We believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to  remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

FTAC’s Board of  Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward.”","['GPN', 'FIS', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'PYPL', 'WY']"

mr23mr,,investing,post,1618440740,"My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?",['TSLA']

mr3c8y,gujsw6r,investing,comment,1618445334,"If the case for equal weighted funds is so that you have more small cap exposure because small cap outperforms large cap, then it becomes a discussion on factors - specifically the size factor.

If you want more risk-adjusted return, equal weighting doesn't give you adequate exposure to the size factor.

You need a small-cap fund that filters out small-cap growth stocks, because historically they actually have a negative total return. You want a small-cap value fund ideally.

If the case for equal weighting is that you don't like FAANG and think tech is overvalued/the next tech bubble is about to burst, well, if you hold VTI and VXUS you're diversified, and that's the best you can do fundamentally. Otherwise you are moving into the realm of investor ""tastes"", which also doesn't have a good risk-adjusted return rate.",

mqy9tn,,investing,post,1618429220,"Vicinity Motor Corp/Grande West Transportation TSXV: $VMC OTC: $BUSXD - Significantly undervalued with amazing growth opportunities ahead Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&t=454s&ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.
* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting
* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.
* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.

Positions:

Currently sitting at 1886 shares at an average price of $7.73 USD

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

It assumes that after the asset price doubling (from $11 to $22), the costs to mine the same quantity of bitcoin stays constant. This may be approximately true with gold. But with bitcoin, the difficulty of mining scales with the number of miners, which in turn scales with the price of the asset to maintain an equilibrium.

So in actuality, after the asset price doubling, it is much more likely to cost $20 to mine $22 worth of bitcoin. Profit margin stays the same as just buying and holding the asset.",

mq6e0u,guf9wli,investing,comment,1618353614,"So this is oversimplified to the point of probably being inflammatory, but here I go:

Firstly, our entire economy, not just the stock market, is predicated on the assumption that growth can and must continue infinitely. All credit and lending is based on the ideal that the supply of money will grow, allowing borrowers to pay off loans with interest and still come out ahead. The stock market's pyramid-ish tendencies are therefore not a risk unique to the stock market.

Secondly, it's my opinion that the U.S. government, and the corporations it is beholden to, are simply never going to let the stock market crash long-term if they can do anything at all to prevent it. That doesn't mean the bull market is infinite, but it means that on a long enough time horizon there are only two possible things that will follow a massive crash:

1) Investors who were properly diversified, and who have the time, cash buffer, and fortitude to hold and ride out the crash will eventually regain the value they lost (which was only ever lost on paper), and investors who have capital on hand to keep buying will make even more profit. 

2) The stock market never recovers, which can only mean the U.S. government as we know it has essentially collapsed, and at that point the fact that your portfolio is worth nothing is probably not your biggest concern.

Historically recessions facilitate more transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, because even though the wealthiest lose the most during a recession initially, the effect is temporary and they still have enough liquid capital on hand to buy up a bunch of assets at a discount from sellers who are hard pressed enough for short-term cash to sell at a loss. 

Bottom line, here's the secret to success: Diversify your investments, increase your cash allocation as you approach an age where you may not have the luxury of waiting for a recovery to play out, buy assets during recessions if you can, and hope that the government doesn't allow income inequality to get bad enough that the guillotines come out.",

“NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

mqbkui,,investing,post,1618347954,"A very bullish DD on $APD, a stock with good earnings, and a huge future of growthI've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (I'm not too informed on these, but here's what wikipedia has to say for those interested: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

In case you're not convinced yet, lets take a look at their competitors. LINDE PLC is the the leader by market cap, with revenues of $27.24 billion annually. APD have a YOY revenue of $8.86 Billion. However, take a look at net income. Despite only making $8.86 Billion, they have a net income of $1.9 billion (a profit margin of 21.5%),while Linde have a net income of $2.5 billion (profit margin of 9%). What makes APD even better is that they have been steadily increasing their YOY profit margin. Linde rocks a P/E ratio of about 60. I think it isn't crazy to put a similar price target on APD, which would essentially double their share price. Even on a bearish case, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to put such a prediction for this pricetag over the next 2-3 years. 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but they have far more room to grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it. There is certainly a bit of speculation here, but each projected market quote was taken from a reputable source.","['LIN', 'APD']"

It's a big chicken egg game; hydrogen producers won't create refueling stations (which are significantly more expensive than gas or electric stations) without sufficient volume of vehicles, and consumers won't buy hydrogen vehicles of there's no infrastructure and convenience.

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/15/young-people-stand-to-make-dismal-returns-on-their-investments

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

1. Company Insiders are selling. 

True 

Yup, they are. And they will continue for the rest of this company's life. They will also eventually buy some as well. It gets scheduled quarterly. It's how companies work. Even Apple. Even Telsa. 

But, something you need to understand was this has been planned since the beginning of February. Its common. 

Here is that form from Feburary... 

https://investors.zomedica.com/node/8536/html

https://investors.zomedica.com/sec-filings 

Here is that rule.. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp 

To conclude, this was just coincidence that they planned to sell their shares while we are in the middle of pretty ruthless selloff . They planned this months ago. I'm sure they were hoping for more but weren't we all. If they really were scammy, I'm sure Cohen could have put out some PR right before today to jump the price of his employees, but they didn't. 

2. Cartridges were sold out? 

Maybe. 

We can't confirm as to why they were off the Miller website yesterday. But, as of this afternoon, they are back. Would be very Bullish if they sold out though. Although maybe someone can confirm, wasn't there 5 of them? Now I only see 3 back so far.

3. Institutions are selling. 

False. 

Don't get me wrong, Institutions buy and sell all the time but from the discrepancy from the Fintel and Nasdaq, it seems like institutional buying is increasing especially at these prices. Somewhat hard to tell though because they only are required to report quarterly.

4. A reverse split is imminent. 

False. 

A bear favorite. It would need to get approved by shareholders, and for which it has been voted against twice. However, a share buyback was approved and will likely happen at some point. The details are not completely clear as to when, but the cheaper the share the more likely the buyback. 



At the end of the day, this period can suck. That said, everyone was begging for these prices again a month ago. Well here we are. Don't get twisted, no one knows where this is headed, it clearly seems manipulated by something stronger than retail buyers. Dropping 5-10% and barcoding for the rest of the day is not normal stock behavior. Because of that, I dont really think this has a floor anywhere in particular. It will be whenever the shorts change their narrative. 


This isn't some post to convince you to buy Zom. I just think there is alot of negative sentiment and misleading information out there. For now, make your own decisions about Zomedica. Nothing about this company has changed other than they are guaranteed revenue for the first time. 

Not financial advice but you already knew that.

This is a nano company that has about 20 employees currently with nearly a 1Bn market cap. The TTM revenue is zero and they have missed earnings estimates for past 4 months. How is the current stock price not based on hype? 

It looks like they have about 60M in working capital with little debt and their annual burn rate is only around 16M so they shouldn't have to raise more money in the short term - which is about the only good thing about this company.

mpyftu,guctimd,investing,comment,1618309593,"Hello. I would like to get an advice about investing as a Russian resident.

1. I'm 31 years old, live in Russia - which has an effect on whole situation.
2. I work as developer. My monthly income is about 1400$, but I hope it will increase as it has been increasing before.
3. My main short-term objective is to save money, and buy a bigger house/apartment after 5-6 years.
4. I have some individual stocks right now: 2 AAPL, 1 ENPH, 2 XOM, 1 MSFT, 1 NEE, 2 PLTR, 1 TSM, 2 UAL, 1 DIS.

&#x200B;

The whole situation with my country makes any saving in local currency a joke. Even housing is not worth. In fact, with my current stocks I'm down 1% in general, but up 4% in my local currency.

There are sanctions on horizon, any time my president could do any shit, which would worsen situation for all the folks. So, I've chosen investing in world (not local) companies.

As a Russian resident I can't easily get access to a foreign broker. So, I'm pretty limited in available stocks and ETFs. My current broker is one of the 3 major Russian banks.

&#x200B;

**ETF or individual stocks?**

Maybe I should buy some ETFs, but again, which ones? There are not so much available for me - most of them are ruled by Russian banks. And I'm afraid they could collapse after sanctions or some other shit.

The only one which is semi-international is FinEx: FXUS, FXDE, FXWO and so on.

With individual stocks I'm more confident, because I'm an shareholder and present in all the required registries. So, I could restore access to my shares if something happens.

The price is less profit compared to ETF and more time spent on tracking companies.

&#x200B;

My current plan is to buy individual stocks regularly. I would chose companies from S&P500 and add some less reliable like ENPH, PLTR.

Short term plan is to buy: little oil (XOM), some cruise (like Carnival), more green energy (NEE), add no-tech companies like Walmart, McDonald's, Procter&Gamble. Also I was thinking about LHA.

So, I would like to diversify, but be more tech.","['WMT', 'MCD', 'NEE', 'CCL', 'DIS', 'ENPH', 'MSFT', 'XOM', 'AAPL', 'UAL', 'SPGI']"
mpr7hk,,investing,post,1618273875,"Canoo Inc. (GOEV) Due Diligence  


**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Tony serves as executive chairman and founded Solera Holdings a successful company that provides risk management, asset protection software, services to the automotive industry and property insurance. He has also served as chairman for multiple other companies including Sportradar Group,Aircraft Performance Group,RocketRoute Limited, global aviation services company, and  APG Avionics LLC.

**Mark Aikman**

Mark Serves as Chief Marketing Officer and he has nearly 20 years of experience including a decade at Daimler AG.

## Ulrich Kranz

Ulrich currently serves as CEO, and has worked with the company since 2017 as the company's CTO (chief technical officer). Since 1986 Ulrich has been involved in the car business holding various leadership positions at BMW AG and caused great innovation.

**Peter Savagian**

Peter Serves as the current CTO and has held multiple different leadership positions at companies including  Ampaire, Inc, Electrified Future,Faraday&Future Inc,Sibros Technologies,and General Motors Company. Which are all companies that have to do with automobiles, electric vehicles, or technology closely related to those categories.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

[Canoo had another no revenue Quarter ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter)

My thoughts: I think that while the recent class action Lawsuit may cause some issues for the company Canoo has a unique product that could become popular, has enough cash to run the business for multiple years even if the release is delayed, and has good management that is in touch with the business Canoo is in.","['DE', 'GM']"

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”",['INTC']

mprkx9,,investing,post,1618275211,"About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM ESTOn Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

We'll know Tuesday at 8:30 AM EST. It could be interesting.",

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

In the long-term, money will flow to those firms that increase their revenues and earnings (which ultimately are able to deliver the greatest amount of cash back to their shareholders). In the short-term you might see some volatility or discrepancies but in the long-term, money follows where money is being made.

This is part of the efficient market framework that people are  so quick to dismiss. Can Tesla or Gamestop continue to have high valuations? Sure...but if they don't start making that expected future cash via increasing earnings and revenues, the market will let Elon Musk and Ryan Cohen know pretty quick.

This is why people like me always recommend a globally-diversified, low-cost index fund like VT. Money will flow wherever the cash is been made. Sometimes it is in large-cap stocks, others in American stocks, and other times in technology stocks.

mohir3,,investing,post,1618104600,"Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s whyWhich is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

mohir3,gu41cxk,investing,comment,1618110477,"The previous 10 years have been the best time to invest in real estate. You can just look for an inflation corrected price index to see the dramatic appreciation in the last decade following (and probably directly resulting from) the 2008 housing value crash. I remember wishing I could buy like mad in 2011, though I was in school with no income. 

I'm not sure now that properties are very expensive and don't cash flow nearly as well (or, usually at all) you can expect the same safe and robust returns. 

Though owning your own home is probably a safe expense to have regardless. The equity building process can be almost like constantly putting money in a bank account pegged to inflation. 
I bet ownership just kind of feels nice too. Especially if you are settling down and no longer want to move around and experience new places.  Probably a very freeing experience to have something that is totally yours.",

In 2021 the NFL is worth 5.7 billion dollars, all because from a few individuals has a dream and took a major gamble.

The  first real season play fpr SNPW is just about ready to just began for SNPW,

SNPW's  teams:

Medrecycler, Sun Pacific Power, Street Smart Outdoors, and   National Mechanical Group  (non glass  solar panels)  are just about done with their exhibition season and about ready  to play for real.

What the exhibition season has revealed so far about the  SNPW teams

\-  The Company’s subsidiary Medrecycler RI, Inc. continues to progress  through the regulatory process  for the approval to construct a 48,000  SF state-of-the-art pyrolysis  facility expected to process 70 tons of  medical waste per day. With approval and the completion of financing,  the project should be operational by the end of 2021

\-  One man who reviewed the tech of Medrecycler has enough faith in the   technology and business plan, that he sees fit to committed 17 MILLION   DOLLARS to buy all the Rhode Island bonds to finance the project.

\-  Many cities have shown faith in the LONG TERM VALUE of Street Smart  outdoor advertising to award them decade long contracts.  Street Smart  is expanding and adding new services to it;s product.  Geopath is  expected to support a strategy for expanding our market reach to  targeted advertisers in the OOH industry and  Atlas Transit Solutions to  collaborate on the development of a  high efficiency off grid digital  plug and play modular unit will  develop a new SMART Bus Shelter which  integrates a new software as a  service that enhances the commuters  experience while driving a new  unique and proprietary product offering

\-  The US Patient office after viewing the science  the technology   granted 5 patents o the Non-glass solar panels and the manufacturing  process for it.  UL certification for the non glass solar panels iare in  the process

\- Free agents were  signed to aid in the Durango Mexico Solar Farm team,  one a solar farm  developer the other a financial backer. Durango Mexico Solar Farm  project  currently undergoing a financial review with a selected EPC and  funding group. This partnership is targeting a financial closing and  the commencement of construction in 2021

As  the exhibition season winds down, we have a chance to evaluation what  type of play we expect to see once the real season begins.

Pre-season  tickets are cheap right now but prices will only go up once  the real season fully starts, and one  can only imagine what those tickets will be  worth after our first complete season and we get to the Super Bowl.

mo5ii4,gu1mw1u,investing,comment,1618064549,URNM - it is directly affected by the demand for uranium. It's also been doing consistently well over these last several weird weeks in the market,
mo5ii4,gu1sh4k,investing,comment,1618067465,"Nuclear power in Europe is currently declining, and I would expect it would continue to decline. There are a few nuclear reactors currently under construction in Europe (UK, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia) but they won't replace the reactors that will be closing.

However, nuclear power is growing in Asia, particularly in China and India. China is currently building a number of reactors, with plans to build many more in order to transition away from coal. Globally, nuclear energy accounts for about 10% of the energy mix and the IAEA projects that by 2050, it will account for somewhere between 6-12%.

Keep in mind that the construction of new reactors is very costly and takes a long time. Maybe there is a play there with reactor construction. The shorter term catalyst in the uranium market will be currently operating nuclear plants securing long-term contracts for supply. Prices have been depressed for a decade and continue to be below the global cost of production. Miners were slow to respond, and there was a lot of existing supply in national stockpiles that were being put into the market, but in the last few years production has been tapering off and is below global demand. At some point, power plants will have to step back into the market and sign multi-year deals to secure supply. Its worth noting as well that the cost of uranium is a pretty small part of the price of generating the power, so plants have plenty of room to pay more.

I would stick to ETFs to get broad sector coverage because it's hard to pick winners and losers. URNM was already mentioned, which is a good choice. My money is currently in URA, which is slightly more concentrated with a slightly lower fee. You're a little late to the game as money has already started to move back into the sector, but there still should be a lot of room for growth as demand picks up.

Edit: After reading a lot of the posts that have been made since I first posted, I would just like to add that this is supposed to be an investing subreddit. The OP didn't ask what you or your friends think about nuclear energy. Nor did he ask you to dream about a time when nuclear energy won't be necessary.

Nuclear power is in decline globally, but still accounts for a large part of the global power mix and is growing in some parts of the world. If you think it isn't ethical, then don't invest your money. Do I want to own Cameco stock in 100 years? No. Will I take the 60% I've made off it already, plus the potential upside of another 100% when uranium prices recover? Yes.

If you don't know about nuclear energy or uranium mining, you shouldn't talk about it on an investing sub. In 2 years, my investments in the uranium mining space have returned an average of 100%. I've sold a bit when prices peaked, but I'm still holding most because uranium prices still haven't recovered. Maybe we can start talking about how to make money, instead of whether fusion reactors are the future or whatever.",
modaz8,,investing,post,1618089578,"Assets Have Tanked at Two of the World’s Biggest Short Sellers**Short Selling is a Risky Business.** 

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”","['TSLA', 'TWTR']"

mok1fb,,investing,post,1618114299,"$MHH - Value Stock in this market; my DDMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

mopsuv,,investing,post,1618142387,"The bear case for BABA (no news is bad news)The stock is down from ATHs for good reasons due to fundamental changes to the the risk profile of the company, and uncertainties regarding the potential for future success it may have moving forward. 

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

-	Investor sentiment remains unchanged.  No new “buzz-worthy” events are coming up and no recent company news that I see promises to serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest or inflows. 

So what’s changed? Anything?

Are these assumptions correct or did I miss something? What makes BABA an attractive investment to consider now, rather than a wait-and-see story which may or may not see upside in the near- to mid-term? Or should I assume this is a dead money play for the reasons stated above. 


TL:DR 

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent. Down to flat are the trends, so they’ll continue until they have reason not to. Opportunity cost says steer clear.",

mok0m1,,investing,post,1618114213,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",
mok0m1,gu4oqfr,investing,comment,1618128647,I think this is a version of a long-short alpha strategy (or whatever) but the flaw may be that those companies may be expensive to short if the market already thinks they’re losers. Also puts may not be available.,

mobt6t,,investing,post,1618084613,"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claimsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it has found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.",

The first line company itself can try to be socially conscious, but at some point their money is going to make its way back into unethical labor, environmental, and social practices. Do they need to ship products? Do they rely on paper? Do they use energy? Where are they sourcing their paper, pens, desks/furniture and other supplies? The world is just too intertwined to avoid having your money make its way back into the hands of companies with unethical practices, and anyone who thinks that they're making a difference by looking for ESG companies are kidding themselves.

I definitely think that we should all be trying to make the world a better, more ethical place, but I don't think this is a good avenue for making that change.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

mo6q8h,,investing,post,1618068257,"DD on Novartis (NVS), and their role in the treatment of opioid dependence disorderThis is my first DD post, so bear (or bull) with me 

(C+C appreciated, as I had a lot of fun researching and writing this) 

Stock Ticker: NVS

Market: NYSE 

Name: Novartis

Category; Pharmaceuticals

Why investigate this stock? 

With the opioid crisis and its ramifications coming into the media spotlight, there has been an increasing body of research into the use of suboxone for treatment of opioid dependence disorder (ODD). For those of you unfamiliar with suboxone, it is a combination of buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication acts as a partial opioid agonist, and the naloxone component helps prevent abuse. In toxicology and ""Medication Assisted Treatment"" circles, it is becoming favored over methadone due to decreased side effect profile and decreased potential for abuse. Recently, some states have significantly expanded training programs so providers can easily obtain an “X waiver”, which is a qualification required for a medical provider to prescribe suboxone. This suggests that it will be increasingly used in Emergency Departments to initiate ODD treatment, and it will see increasing use in the outpatient clinic setting. 

So why Novartis?

For those of you familiar with Suboxone’s history, it is actually made by the drug company Reckitt Benckiser. However, recently they authorized a generic version which is to be distributed by, you guessed it, Novartis (technically a subsidiary Sandoz, but all traded under the ticker NVS)

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:\~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior).

I’m not saying that generic suboxone is going to be “the next big thing”, however I think it will be mainstay of ODD treatment moving forward in the US given low cost, increasing ease of access, and low(er) side effect profile when compared to other medications for ODD. (Some of you may remember Vivitrol aka long acting Naltrexone, see the head to head vs suboxone here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext))

I like to look at the P/E ratio as a good starting point to see if the stock is over/under valued compared to its earnings. This can suggest the ability to weather downturns in a market that trends towards over-valuing stocks compared to their real world earnings. 

Next, the relative strength index (RSI). For those of you unfamiliar it is a momentum indicator (I have my own opinions on momentum investing, which I can talk about in a different post). Whether you fall on the side of a value investor or a momentum investor, I think it’s an interesting index to take a look at for any stock, and can help you “time” your purchase. **Remember, there is no end all be all market index.** Regardless, the RSI was developed in 1978 and evaluates price changes to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI is listed from 0-100, with a value < 30 suggesting that a stock is undervalued, and should be bought. A value > 70 suggests a stock is overvalued and should be sold. If you’re interested, take a look into how it is calculated to see why a higher RSI suggests overvalue. 

Anyways, the RSI of Novartis as of this post is 54.4, with a steady trend upwards since February. So what does that suggest? Basically that it is neither overbought or oversold, but has a trend towards being overbought, which doesn’t help us much. . 

Here’s a few good resources to check RSI on stocks you’re interested in: 

[https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab\_name=rsi](https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab_name=rsi)

[https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563)

Looking at the financials of NVS for Q4, they are reassuring. 

See here for financial stats, but they can easily be googled otherwise: 

[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo)

The company demonstrated strong Q4 performance, with increases in Revenue, Net Income, and Profit Margins. However, using the golden rule that **past performance is not indicative of future performance** (except when one takes advantage of specific aspects of momentum investing, again to be discussed in a later post), I would not recommend using financial performance metrics to guide purchases (especially in highly volatile markets), but they do give you a snapshot of the company’s current financial environment. 

Above I’m suggesting that generic suboxone will likely provide a value to the company overtime, as suboxone gains prominence in treatment of ODD. However, what else is NVS up to? 

COVID 19

No covid 19 therapeutics, however Novartis is assisting Pfizer and CureVac in production capacity. Specifically, they will be assisting in filling the vials. I don’t think this will contribute much financially, but it’s good PR, and lets face it good for human kind. 

Current Pharmaceuticals

Novartis is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, so I’m not going to go into an exhaustive list of their products. You can find them on the wikipedia page here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals)

However, many of their drugs have good staying power. Of note, they make Entresto, an Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibitor. For my renal nerds out there take a look at the mechanism, really awesome stuff.. There was a lot of buzz in the medical community about Entresto a few years back. This NEJM trial was huge, showing that the Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibition was superior to Enalapril in reducing risks of death and hospitalization. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor medication which has become a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077)

Digital Health

Novartis recently partnered with Science 37, who has developed an interesting system for virtual clinical trials. COVID 19 was a catalyst for digital health, and I think companies that provide telehealth platforms are going to continue to grow. Many patients love the telehealth option, and often opt for it over an in-person visit for many smaller medical issues/checkups. 

Clinical Trials 

As a large pharmaceutical company, Novartis has a well established clinical pipeline for research. I find that betting on the “next big thing” or breakthrough in therapy is typically a losing bet, especially because you have no idea what the results will be as molecular therapies and typical pharmaceuticals go through the rigorous phases of clinical trials. It is a better to bet on a company that has a lot of experience bringing products to market, with a large research pool to pull from. This article has a great table demonstrating the “success rates” of various drug classes coming to market: 

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:\~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate).

(Spoiler: It’s not good) 

Overall, NVS has demonstrated steady growth, and is a huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. They have a large pool of research and will be responsible for the generic version of Suboxone, which I believe will have a strong role in treatment of ODD moving forward in the opiate crisis. The technicals on NVS are pretty middle of the road, with a reassuring P/E ratio and a dead center RSI. I think it would be a good value investment in the long term, but short term gains may be difficult. 

Finally, what I think is appropriate for the end of all DD posts, is that this isn’t me telling you to buy or sell this stock. Rather, I’ve compiled some information about the company that should be a starting point for your own research and evaluation",['PFE']

mobmuc,,investing,post,1618084019,"Smith & Nephew (SNN) - Sports injury/hip-replacement play still over 20% discounted from CovidI don't regularly make posts about individual securities...actually this would be my first. I'm tired of daily DD posts on companies that are at ATH, so here's a mini-DD on one that is still heavily discounted from Covid. And of course...this is not investment advice, do your own due diligence.

Let's look at where they made their business in 2020:

- $1.9 billion in revenue in orthopedics: mainly knee implants, hip implants, & trauma devices.

- $1.3 billion in sports medicine

- $1.3 billion in wound management

So we have a company that makes most of their revenue in sports, injuries, and hip/knees. Literally all things that were put on halt due to Covid. As to be expected, 2020 was a terrible year for them, with revenue down 11.2% and EPS down 25%. They also under-performed all their larger peers (i.e. Striker, Zimmer Biomet) whom thanks to more diversified products were not hit as hard.

I believe most of their under-performance is due to events that are transitory:

- Decline in sports injuries due to Covid.

- Postponement of knee/hip surgeries due to Covid.

- Brexit (they are a UK company)

- Inability to effectively run their sales due to Covid & lockdowns.


Let's look at some headwinds that I think the market is not factoring in:

- They have actually increased their R&D budget by nearly 5% during Covid, while most other device companies are tightening.

- The UK is planning to increase corporate taxes to 25% in 2023, however they will have a temporary 130% super-deduction for plant/equipment through March 2023. Meanwhile, UK plans no change to their 13% credit on R&D. I believe SNN, a device manufacturer, will be an out-sized beneficent of this change in tax policy.

- Potential buyout opportunity from one of the larger device makers.

Finally, SNN's debt looks reasonable, and Price/Sales ratio is literally almost at the same spot it was in 2014/2015..a rarity in this market. And their revenue growth has slowly climbed from $3.8 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2019, only falling down to $4.5 billion in 2020. So 2020 was, other than a small drop in 2012, the only year they had a major decline in revenue.

If it's not clear by now I am long SNN. I purchased after Covid and planning for a long term hold...now I'm waiting for schools to re-open, sports to come back in full force, and for people to get injured again rather than sit at home in their bubble. It's only a matter of time before people are playing hockey, or recreational soccer.

**Wrestlemania 37** (WWE) is this weekend and returning with a live audience. One of the marquee matches: Big E vs Apollo Crews in a Nigerian Drum Fight. I don't know exactly what a Nigerian Drum Fight is, but I smell $$$ for the sports-injury device company Smith+Nephew.",['ZBH']

\-A soon to be named auto company is entering a deal with Arbe that will result in 300 million in sales for one model, and could account for 10x (3 billion) in sales for more models.

\-The auto company is likely a US company because it is described as “Western” while the OEM described next to this mystery Western company in the presentation is described as “European”(If it’s a Western and not European, it’s likely a US company) *(\*See investor presentation slide 22)*

\-Elon Musk is quoted in the Arbe investor presentation - “Lidar is doomed” (\*Agree or disagree with Musk feeling this way today, the company is making a point in their presentation about the value of their \~$100 radar on chip IP outperforming the Lidar tech that can costs $1,000’s)

\-Arbe is a “First Mover” and “Market Leader” in 4D imaging radar technology-(Slide 16). This positions them to be chosen first to take the place of traditional radars in the exact same slot that is already built in for radar use, but can now be used for 4D imaging radar chips.

# Who is Arbe Robotics / $ITAC and what do they do?

\-$ITAC recently merged with Arbe Robotics to create a publicly traded company

\-Their product is the first and only available long-range, 4D Imaging Radar (so little to no competition)

\-Their 4D Imaging Radar:

\>Is used in personal cars, trucking, delivery, industry, agriculture, mining, etc. \*(Primary / most profitable focus is the automotive industry)

\>Is needed for every level of vehicle autonomy (Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

\>Supposedly outperforms Lidar and Cameras, especially in fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and other poor conditions (see performance details below)

\>Fits in the same slot that current, old radars fit in, but their radar provides over 100x better quality, and a 4th dimension, allowing you to “see” objects in a new way

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Is Arbe’s technology a “disruptor” with a large market opportunity?

1. Qamcom’s CEO explains why Arbe’s technology is a disruptor that supersedes existing alternatives - “Choosing Arbe as a partner was an obvious choice since there is no other radar chipset solution on the market that is comparative,” said Johan Lassing, chief executive officer of Qamcom. “Traditional or contemporary radar solutions don’t solve the challenges that autonomous vehicles face. Arbe revolutionized radar by creating a sensor that provides a never-before-seen image which is close to the image that vision based sensors achieve that also has the properties of radar – Arbe’s 4D Imaging Radar Solution has the potential to be the primary sensor candidate for the sensor suite of any autonomous and semi-autonomous applications and next generation perception platforms.”
2. The CEO says their new 4D Visual Radar technology is designed to fit in the same spot as existing radars, making it immediately usable by auto companies[ ](https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/173-noam-arkind-arbe-robotics/id1353975287?i=1000501753796)
3. The 4D Imaging Radar is suitable for every level of vehicle autonomy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
4. Already has “key partnerships” with Nvidia, Valeo, Denso, and other reputable/large companies involving their radar-on-chip technology (\*See slide 9 of investor presentation)
5. The technology can be used outside of cars - e.g. mines, agriculture, trucking, delivery, more -[ ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/qamcom-will-bring-arbes-4d-imaging-radar-to-trucks-mines-and-farms/)
6. CEO claims their main competitor is Mobileye (\*Mobileye was bought out by Intel for $15 million). CEO claims Mobileye will have a chipset in 2025 that is similar to what Arbe already has today (\*See investor webcast link below)
7. Resolution and performance supersedes all existing radar technology[ ](https://www.embedded.com/imaging-radar-development-platform-offers-2k-resolution/)
8. The Arbe CEO explains their IP value “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""

# Valuation/Profitability considerations

\-Arbe CEO said “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""[ https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc\_src=social-sh&soc\_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&__twitter_impression=true)

\-The Arbe CEO says ""When Mobileye passed $300 million in revenue, the figure that we are expecting for 2025, Intel bought them for $15 billion.”

\-The Spac transaction values Arbe at a low $572 million enterprise value, implying only a 1.8x multiple on 2025 forecasted revenue and a 4.4x multiple on 2025 forecasted pro forma Adjusted EBITDA \*This presumably does not account for new or unexpected deals that may arise of the 10 auto companies they are currently in final stage talks with, or the company referred to as “one of the largest auto companies in the world”

\-ITAC/Arbe has a small, 7.7 million share public float which could move quickly when catalysts are revealed (\*Institutional elements of the non-public float include a PIPE paid for by respected “strong hand” institutional investors such as M&G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures, and Eyal Waldman-(founder and CEO of Mellanox Technologies $MLNX))

\-The institutional portion of the float is unlikely to sell - “What matters is not the price or the valuation at the time of the flotation, but in the long term; especially when the **holdings of all the existing shareholders are vested for at least a year**, so you don't sell in a hurry“[ ](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-has-more-unicorns-than-all-of-europe-1001366171)

\-The CEO recently recommended that shareholders hold shares until they reach a $15 billion dollar market cap-(This is his 3rd company and he believes this company will reach that)(\*This source is described as “Israel's largest and most popular news and content website”) -[ ](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5907598,00.html)

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Summary

Arbe developed and patented a new type of 4D radar imaging technology that negates the need for expensive lidar and vastly improves existing camera/radar performance (over 100x better than existing radar). Arbe is the “first mover” in the market, with little to no competition. The new 4D imaging radar fits in the same slot in a car that the older radar technology uses, making the transition easy for auto companies. The total market for the product includes all Tiers of vehicles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The price was designed to be virtually the same as existing radars-($100 per unit, $150 for premium), and is drastically more affordable than paying $1,000’s for lidar. Arbe’s 4D radar vastly outperforms the more expensive Lidar in many conditions such as fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and more, making it indispensable for both ADAS and autonomous applications.

\*Value will be confirmed by catalyst/deals soon, as the CEO has many quotes describing deals they are signing to be publicized shortly (see above).

mo18p6,gu1m10u,investing,comment,1618064068,"I am in my mid-thirties, been investing since my late twenties in a Roth IRA with Vanguard, doing monthly (now weekly) buys of an appropriate Target Retirement Fund. It's 90% stocks, 10% bonds. 

I feel comfortable with a 100% stocks allocation at this point (still 30 years off from retirement) and am considering exchanging all my Target Retirement shares for VTSAX shares, which will hopefully do better for me in the long run (I would continue my weekly investments in VTSAX for the future).

 I am only nervous because it would be the largest single transaction I've ever made, so I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake!

1. My personal risk appetite aside, is there any reason not to do this?
2. Is there a specific time I should aim to do this? (It seems everything is at a high right now, but does it mean anything?)
3. I'm pretty sure there are no fees associated with an exchange like this. Is that true?

SIDE NOTE: I opened a SEP-IRA so I can contribute some of my small business (sole proprietorship) income to this, since I'll be maxing out my Roth IRA. Should I aim to contribute to a different fund (i.e. not whatever my Roth is contributing to)?

Say I buy $1k of $ABC, it goes up to $10k, and I sell it all. I owe taxes on $9k. Now I turn around and buy $10k of $DEF. It tanks, and I sell at $1k to break even. Do I still owe taxes on the $9k profit? Or do I owe taxes on $6k of that $9k profit (there's a $3k max loss deduction, no)?

Similarly, take the same situation but say I change my mind about selling, and buy back in the next day for the same price and amount of what I sold it for. It then tanks and I sell it for the exact same price and amount as I originally bought in for with that $1k. Do I owe taxes on any of that?

The current valuation of $10B dwarfs the $4B it was valued at in a private funding round in 2020, and at approximately $1B more than Beyond Meat. This is despite the fact that BYND brought in 400M in FY revenue compared to Impossible Meat's 150M estimated annual revenue.

The [Pi Cycle Top Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/) (warning - terrible on mobile) has historically been effective in picking out the timing of market cycle highs to within 3 days.
It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2.

Note: The multiple is of the price values of the 350DMA not the number of days.

For the past three market cycles, when the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking.

It is also interesting to note that 350 / 111 is 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. In fact, it is the closest we can get to Pi when dividing 350 by another whole number.

It once again demonstrates the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price action over long time frames. Though in this instance it does so with a high degree of accuracy over the past 7 years.

IMO, indicators like these are likely to be only coincidental, although, it’s past accuracy warrants it’s significance. It must be taken into account as well as all previous tops have been blow off tops rather than an Elliott wave ending diagonal (if bitcoin is topping right now). This discrepancy may reduce its accuracy.

However, [my own personal amateur TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/DAn0UXkz-Bitcoin-close-to-Macro-Top/) seems to share a bearish stance. (Note- TA is from early February but trend lines have not been broken so it is still relevant) [Sentiment](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/relative-unrealized-profit--loss/) also seems to be in the ballpark of previous macro tops. 

Having said this, I am only an amateur and i wouldn’t put much stock into my opinion. It is most likely flawed and history has shown it is incredibly hard to predict the pops of bubbles. I could easily see bitcoin exploding to 100k next week. I would not be surprised at all. I am just urging cautiousness, please be sure to set stop losses.",

mn8840,,investing,post,1617937608,"JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground)

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",['JPM']

Still, despite this, Naspers for years traded at a substantial discount. Mutual fund FPA Crescent tried a long Naspers short Tencent trade for a long time (just owning Tencent would have been a better idea.) In an attempt to narrow that discount, they spun out the Tencent stake and the other tech investments into Prosus, which (last I looked) still trades at a discount.

Prosus sold 2% and still owns around 28% of Tencent. Also, ""It also promised not to sell any further Tencent shares for at least the next three years."" (https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html)

Prosus is a tech investor. Prosus sells at a discount. This is simply some inevitable profit taking to raise money to buy back shares (in hopes of narrowing the discount) and/or looking for other new investments. I don't think it's anything even slightly dramatic.",

mn9mjt,,investing,post,1617942867,"[DD] Bull or Bear: Nano X Imaging (NNOX)General disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

---

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**
---

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

I would have a price target of NNOX at $50 (for the risk adverse) - $100 (if you truly believe).","['WAT', 'GOOGL']"

mn9mjt,gtxbw14,investing,comment,1617973082,">$40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX

This seems extremely expensive in the PACS/RIS space.

edit:
So, for folks who haven't worked in this industry, here's a normal radiology workflow:

1. Your doctor orders a study be done.
1. Scheduling dept creates a work order/appointment in their RIS (radiology information system). This is usually integrated into the HIS (hospital information system) of the Hospital that the DR is affiliated to/has admitting privileges to.
1. Patient shows up for their xray, so they get checked in on the RIS. 
1. Rad tech pulls up the work order on the RIS, preps the patient, and takes photos with the ""modality"" - what people in the industry call things like XRay machines, CT scanners, Ultrasound machines, nuke med machines, and so on. This is basically the ""camera takes photos"" portion. The modality is the camera. They produce photos that can either be printed to film (in the old days) or more likely get digitally transferred into a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System). This company makes cameras, basically. They don't make the photos, they don't make the photo album.
1. The study shows up for the radiologist to read in the PACS. They read it and dictate their findings in the PACS.
1. The dictation shows up in a worklist for a transcriptionist to transcribe into the medical record in the PACS or RIS.
1. The radiologist checks and approves the transcription in the PACS.
1. The study is made available to the requesting doctor with the findings, and the patient gets appropriate treatment.

So out of this entire multistep workflow, this company only seems to make the camera portion. This portion is not usually done as an ""as a service"" since these are huge $6-$8 figure machines, that can require tens of thousands to millions to even get installed. 

Support contracts may be based off of quantity of studies performed, but they're not charging 35% of dang price of every single study. That's absurd. There'd be no incentive to move away from plate + film printing since it would cost more in fees than it would in film doing things ""the old fashioned way"".

That makes me think they're trying to bundle in PACS functionality, but that's absolutely not a good thing. PACS systems are how you store the photos, and retrieve them for viewing, dictating readings, etc.

PACS systems often charge ingestion/storage/viewing fees to access the studies. But even then the pricing is absurd. The PACS system I personally ran charged a few dollars per study, scaling depending on the type (tiny nuke med studies were cheaper than massive mammo studies or gigantic multislice CT scans). XRays are near the low end of the requirements scale. They're just singular pictures, and there's usually only a handful of them. They aren't a ""hot ticket"", which would price them above the competition. 

So, maybe they're relying on the PACS to be *""that good""* - then you've got the issue with PACS/HIS/RIS systems being extremely sticky, and hospitals likely have one already. That means a huge burden to switch.

The medical arena has made it a standard of not having standards. This means any time you attempt to change something, you have to hire specialists called HL7 Programmers to re-implement the gateway systems that translate information between all of these disparate systems and standards. Yes - they made a standard out of the translation system between the standards, rather than implementing a single standard.

The overhead is so massive that many PACS/HIS/RIS vendors will literally give away the modalities and supporting ecosystems to entice customers to switch, figuring they can make it up on support contracts. Modalities like the one this company is making.

There's a massive moat here.

&#x200B;

We all know that gaming is growing and that it will be a good market to be in for the long term.  According to Grand View Research [The Video Game Market is Projected to grow at 12.9% CAGR from 2020-2027 and the Streaming market will have a CAGR of 20.4% over the same time period](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-gaming-market-size-worth-7-24-billion-by-2027--cagr-48-2-grand-view-research-inc-301220945.html#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Market%20%E2%80%93%20The%20global,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027). also, the [Gaming Headset market is projected to have a 7.5% CAGR from 2020-2026](https://www.wboc.com/story/43596299/gaming-headset-market-2021-is-estimated-to-clock-a-modest-cagr-of-75nbspduring-the-forecast-period-2021-2026-with-top-countries-data)  I am sure that there are other projections which are more than this and that there are others that there are less. However, I would argue even if the numbers are 10% instead of 12.9%, 17% instead of 20.4% and 6% instead of 7.5% that you would want to jump into this industry as it is going to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

Now a little background on [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)

&#x200B;

Turtle Beach was originally founded in the 1970s and their main goal was making sound software/hardware for musicians. In 2005, however, they decided to use their experience in engineering sound to create headsets for gamers and that has been what they have focused on since.  If you want more info on their history you can go [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Beach_Corporation)

&#x200B;

Now Turtle beach is  known for their gaming headsets - they have nearly half the market share in gaming headsets per their last earnings call [You can see the earnings call transcript here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411642-turtle-beach-corporation-hear-ceo-juergen-stark-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) in addition to this, however, they also own [Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/) and [Neat Microphones](https://www.neatmic.com/)

&#x200B;

So now that we have a little background on Turtle beach, I will give you the reasons that I think they are set up perfectly to capture this growing market and to grow in the years to come.

&#x200B;

The Financials:

[Yahoo finance financials for HEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEAR/financials/)

&#x200B;

2 things really stick out for me for Turtle beach when you compare them to the other companies in the industry: 1. their balance sheet and 2. their cost of revenue

If you look at the balance sheet you will see the have an objectively great balance sheet.  $167 in Current assets  - $47 million of which is Cash on hand and $78 Million in Current liabilities - almost all of which is short term payable and accrued expenses. The bottom line is **the company has $47 million in cash and $0 in debt**.  They also have a great gross profit - coming in at about 37% of revenue. which when compared to companies in their industry like Corsair who has a 27% gross profit %.

&#x200B;

Now is where I think people really miss out on Turtle Beach, everyone thinks they are still just a headset company, primarily for consoles - obviously their ticker  doesn't help this image, but they are expanding their foothold into the Computer parts and microphones aggressively.  Per the last earnings call: "" We will continue to expand our PC  gaming portfolio of headsets, keyboards, and mice. The additional  ROCCAT PC products we launched in the fall last year will be followed by  another wave of really exciting new PC gaming products this year. As  I've mentioned, our near-term goal is to create an incremental $100  million business in PC accessories and our longer-term goal is to lead  those PC gaming categories."" How do we know this is really what they are doing and not just simply something said to make investors happy? well if you go to Turtle Beach's website and look at the [Careers Page](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/careers/) you will see that one of the jobs is director of brand marketing - Roccat. This along with the news today that [Roccat just snagged a deal with LCS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turtle-beachs-roccat-pc-brand-123000929.html) tells me they will continue to grow this brand.

In addition to this Turtle beach is still being valued as a gaming headset company.  Look at their PE ratio - it's only 12.19 as of closing today.  Compare that to other players in the sector - Corsair at roughly 27, Logitech at roughly 20 and razer who doesn't turn a profit last I checked.  A PE of 12 for a company with no debt in an industry that will continue to grow is an amazing prospect - however their current valuation makes sense if you think they are simply making headsets which will have moderate growth in the years to come verses PC accessories.

I do want to mention some quick risks to Turtle beach as I think there are some which could very much derail the company:

1. My whole case for Turtle beach depends on them growing Roccat and Neat Microphone - either of these could fail and if that is the case they will have trouble growing at a good pace - compare this to the branding that Corsair, logitech, and Razer already have, and you have a company that should be trading at a lower PE ratio
2. Similar to above, they are a very concentrated company and the majority of their sales do come from headsets, that industry will not grow at an alarmingly fast rate, so that will stifle their growth if it cannot be addressed.
3. While the amount of cash they have for their company size is incredibly good, it is not an amazing amount of cash compared to companies like Logitech, who , if I did my math correctly, [has 1.3 Billion in cash on hand, enough to buyout Turtle Beach at their current market value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/balance-sheet?p=LOGI).
4. Following the above, In this industry moats are hard to find, while this is a good thing for the growth of Roccat, it is a dangerous thing for the Turtle Beach headsets
5. Finally, due to the company size, one or two poor moves could really derail the company, so that is something to keep in mind.

Overall I am very bullish on the company, this is not my most in depth DD (time has been tight to do a good write up), but I think I brought up most of my bull points.

Positions: Currently 46 @ an Average cost of 25.57.  I will continue to add more shares though throughout the year as I believe this company is undervalued and in a great position to grow.

mn4cq4,,investing,post,1617924396,"Hedging the Hedgefundie (UPRO & TMF)So I've been considering using a significant amount of my portfolio towards implementing Hedgefundie's 55/45 strategy: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007

&nbsp;

Basically, it is a buy and hold strategy where 3x leveraged S&P 500 UPRO and 3x leveraged 20-year bonds TMF are held 55 to 45 percent, but if we use options to hedge, you could change this allocation to favor UPRO more than TMF (70/30, 75/25, or even 100 UPRO)

&nbsp;

Right off the bat, there's a few concerns with this strategy. First, it is very volatile and depends on the SPY continuing to move steadily up. Many folks are speculating we're in a bubble that is bound to burst somewhat soon. 

&nbsp;

By far the biggest issue with this strategy is that a large drawdown in SPY could absolutely tank UPRO given that it is 3x leveraged. Last March, the fund went from ~$80 to ~$20 in just a couple of weeks, and only reached $80 again in January of this year.

&nbsp;

The inherent hedge of this strategy is in TMF as bonds are often negatively correlated to equities. During the same crash last year, TMF shot up from ~$31 to ~$47, and stayed above $40 for a good portion of the year.

&nbsp;

However, bonds increasing when the SPY decreases isn't a guarantee, so why wouldn't we hedge further by buying some puts on UPRO and TMF ~10% OTM dated a year or so out? This is particularly compelling with Volatility at a low-point at the moment. Puts at this price range for this far out would cost quite a bit, roughly 10% of total investment, but would limit max loss in the event of a major downturn to cost of puts + how far OTM the puts are (20% total).

&nbsp;

Should such a downturn occur, there's a couple things that could happen:

1) UPRO crashes, TMF goes up: in this case the gains from TMF will partially offset the losses in UPRO and you could exercise your put on UPRO and reinvest back in when the market starts to recover.

2) UPRO and TMF both crash: In this case you could exercise the puts and reinvest during the recovery. In the worst case scenario that the market doesn't recover (bear market) you would exercise your puts  and realize a 20% loss from initial investment.

&nbsp;

Given the potential returns of UPRO, it seems likely that it would be capable of generating some impressive returns, particularly if stock market is able to continue the bull-party for the rest of the year. Given the optimism around re-opening and the Fed's dovish monetary policy, this is a definite possibility. And if the market really does break? You could certainly do worse than 20% loss.

I'm sure I'm missing something about this, so before committing to this plan I was hoping to get some opinions. 

Thanks!

EDIT: The major concern I think with this, is the high cost of buying the puts. You would need for UPRO to gain 10% to break even on the puts within the next 288 days (for a Jan 21, 2022 expiration). Of course, this could possibly be mitigated a bit by selling covered calls on UPRO.",['SPGI']

mminfh,,investing,post,1617851206,"LARK seems like a good buyThis small regional bank has some nice things going for it. They’ve consistantly grown their business over the years. They’ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which won’t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition. It was one thing that worried me and caused me to email their investor relations, but fidelity just has a bad newsfeed because the company is so small.",

1. Revenue and profit have been growing for the last 5 years. Even during a pandemic.
2. Free cash flow has been growing for the last 5 years, too. 
3. Net Margin is high, not sure if this is normal for bank industry.
4. Still paying a good % of dividends
5. They're paying down debts while positive in cashflow
6. Equity has been consistently and slowly growing
7. PE ratio at 6.40

Its 5-yr Av. FCF x 15 (conservative number) = **$186M**

And it''s currently being traded at **$124M** marketcap.

I like buying stock based on its free cash flow and this is a strong signal for me that they're undervalued, as long they have a healthy balance sheet.

The only thing that I don't like here is they keep issuing more shares, not crazy but slowly, which is normal for a micro-cap company. However, I stumbled down a post they started buying back their shares last year.

*""Landmark Bancorp Board Approves Stock Repurchase Program Of Up To An Aggregate Of 225,890 Shares Of Co""*

Based on its TTM Cashflow statement, they just bought $2,000,000 worth of shares.

I love a stock when they consider buying back their shares, imagine for a micro-cap company, because it's definitely a good sign that they value their shareholders. I love this practice from companies that are publicly traded.

I think I have enough signals to start a <1% position in my portfolio and just watch. I'll be cost-average if they're doing great. I think there's upside potential on this stock and have room to grow from acquisitions but I'm buying from its current cash flow at the moment.

Free cash flow is positive but it’s always worth paying attention to the Balance Sheet when it comes to banks (which is never that straight forward given the varying degrees of regulatory capital required), personally I like to have a decent buffer of Net Book Value v Market Cap as in a liquidation scenario the costs to collect/sell assets are going to eat into this buffer.

mminfh,gtta9d9,investing,comment,1617891696,"At first glance, this looks like a value play based on high level ratios, including P/B, but as they say, there's often more to the story than seems to be the case...

I'm just an average FP&A guy, not a superstar by any means... but what immediately stuck out to me in two seconds of looking at their financials is that the industry's Loan Loss Provision is 2.5 times that of LARK's, and on a micro cap, one small wave of defaults could put this company immediately underwater.

Consider that when BOA acquired Countrywide they discovered that a full third of Countrywide's loans were in default.  Countrywide's acquisition price was 2000 times larger than LARK's market cap.

I've got 20 years of experience in financial and data analytics, and even I don't feel confident in my valuation of banks because once you start getting into Level 2 and Level 3 assets, the valuations are so complicated that even some folks at Goldman couldn't tell you with accuracy what the bank is worth.

Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

>1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

mm65gx,gtqacmj,investing,comment,1617827158,"Really interesting passage here from Dimon w.r.t post 2008 banking regulation and it's impact on loans:

> To understand this in more specific terms, look at the chart above that shows, prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had $13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending (this is, in part, directly related to the new liquidity requirements) may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experienced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more had been lent, the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been faster. 

I haven't heard this brought up before but it's something worth considering.

Also regarding QE and deficit spending:

> If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quantitative easing (QE) and deficit spending averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period after the Great Recession did not result in higher GDP growth and possibly higher inflation. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 4%, which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%.

> And so why did all this QE not have the effect you would have thought? QE was never effectively tried prior to the Great Recession, and it is different from fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securities from security holders who tend to reinvest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset prices and creates some spending (through the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may have some inflationary effects, mostly on asset prices. But on the other hand, it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves, which is an input cost for businesses, and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement income). And finally, in this most recent round of QE, much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back as deposits at the Fed, not as loans.

But an increasing amount of systemic risk is now taking place outside of those regulations.

Take a recent topic of a lot of discussion: Coinbase. As of their December reporting, they had over 90B of customer assets, which would have put them in the top 40 banks. I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

mm9ppe,,investing,post,1617823242,"Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sourcesBy Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.","['AES', 'XOM', 'MS']"

mmg62o,,investing,post,1617842616,"$BAOS - Baosheng Media - Recent IPO Play Extremely Undervalued and Primed to Make Moves in 2021**Background:**

Baosheng Media Group is a Chinese Online Marketing solution provider. It's main business model is connecting advertisers to online media. Managing marketing activities, advertising strategies, budgets, and ad optimization services.

**Growth:**

Baosheng Media Group has been steadily growing revenues seeing year over year increases from 2018 to 2019 of 10.5% from $16.16 million to $17.85 million. Securing long term contracts with many media moguls such as: Tiktok, Amazon, Ctrip, 360 finance and Youku.

**Future Growth:**

$BAOS ipo'ed in early February 2021, offering 6 million shares at a IPO price of $5 a share. Raising $30 million in proceeds which will be used for expanding the Company's business scale and building its network of leaders/acquiring employees.

China's digital marketing spending is rapidly growing, with 2021 forecasts expected to increase 20% from 2020. With expected annual growth of above 20% as companies are looking to more short-form video ads and social media ads.

$BAOS is looking to capitalize on this growth by utilizing funds to enter into new sections such as NFT marketing and into the crypto currency field. BAOS received backing and a $10million investment from Ebang $EBON in late March to develop a blockchain-based platform/NFT and crypto currency platform.

BAOS is looking to create a platform to buy and sell NFT related work and enter an exploding market. NFT's market cap grew 1785% from 2020 in early 2021 due to the NFT craze. With China leading the market in dollar volume and spending.

**Margins and Ratios: (competitor valuations)**

BAOS is a market leader when it comes to profitability and margins.

BAOS reported 9.5m and 11.16m in pretax income in 2018 and 2019.

Those are margins of 58.7% and 62.5% respectively for their years.

Return on equity: 43.2% vs market average of 4.78%

Return on assets: 13.27% vs market average of 1.27%

Their bottom line has been steadily improving year over year through developing efficiencies and capitalizing on market trends.

**BAOS:**

Market Cap: 172M

Revenue: 17.8M

Earnings per share of 0.4

Price to earnings of: 14.72

Net profit: 10.8M

Cash on Hand: 51M

**SRAX:**

Market Cap:115M

Earnings per share of (0.69)

Price to earnings: N/A

Revenues: 8.6M

Net Loss: (14.6M)

Cash on Hand:9M

**IZEA:**

Market Cap: 270M

Revenue: 18.3M

Earnings per share of (0.248)

Net Loss: (10.2M)

Cash on hand: 33M

**Comparatives;**

As you can see BAOS is deeply undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few small cap marketing companies that are operating at a profit (62.5%) at that aswell. It also has the strongest balance sheet and cash balance among its peers.

**Cash Position:**

BAOS is flush with cash and there is no threat of any share dilutions/offerings. BAOS is sitting on over 51 million in cash. Broken out by 11Million in cash pre IPO, 30Million from IPO proceeds and another 10 million received from EBON.

BAOS is cash flow positive with cash from operations each year in excess of 9M annually, further increasing its cash position.

BAOS will be looking to utilize this cash to grow its business through acquisitions, new infrastructure such as NFT platforms and acquiring talented individuals.

**Public Float:**

Baos has one of the smaller active tradeable floats on the market. The initial offering only issued 6 million shares of BAOS with many of these shares being locked up until August.

The stock is largely unknown with volumes being very scarce. This is causing significant bid/ask spreads upwards of 3-4%. This also means there is very few walls for when this gains momentum.

**China Low Float Recent IPO Trend**

Chinese low float stocks have been getting pumped across the markets lately. Many of which have been recent IPO's due to their share lock up periods further reducing the floats.

Some prime examples include:

$EEIQ running form $3.58 to $35.20 in 2 days

$UTME running from $4 to $107 in 2 days

$WAFU running from $4 to $21 in 2 days.

$BAOS meets all the above criteria, with a small float, small market cap and in a hot sector. NFT/Crypto

**Upcoming Press Releases:**

I am expecting a press release to be issued in the next week or two regarding the demo/roll out of their NFT platform.

BAOS's first press release was issued on March 18th regarding the EBON collaboration and entry into the NFT field. This was the first day the company could release news due to its 40day quiet period after a IPO. EBON stated in early February it was looking to enter the NFT field. I expect the partnership was entered in early to mid February. Meaning a news release on the development of the platform for BAOS should be right around the corner.

NFT press releases have cause stocks to skyrocket, and was the hottest sector in March. With stocks such as TKAT, HOFV, DLPN and WKEY gaining as much as 1000%. These stocks have cooled off but most are still trading at 2.5-5x their pre press release values.

The market has cooled off since March but I do expect a large movement the day the PR comes out due to the thin walls and small public float.

**Summary/Price target**

BAOS is a unknown hidden gem. The cash obtained through IPO and Ebon investment will help it improve/expand its infrastructure and significantly grow the business. BAOS is already experiencing over 10% annual growth and these numbers will explode in 2021 thanks to China's online marketing spending growth of 20% + in 2021 combined with BAOS entering into the NFT market which grew 1785% from 2020. BAOS is sitting on over 51m in cash and there is no risk of share offerings due to its cash flow from operations exceeding 9m a year. BAOS is a market leader when it comes to cost minimization and profit margins, experiencing over 62% margins in 2019. BAOS is unknown to many and is not getting the traction is deserves, the first press release will send this flying thanks to its bid/ask spread and being in the NFT sector. BAOS is undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few profitable marketing small cap companies and is sitting on a boat load of cash.

PT Short Term (May): 10$ after the press release relating to the release of its NFT platform. This would make it the similar market cap as IZEA, while BAOS has substantially more cash and is reporting 11m in net income vs Izea's 10M losses.

PT Long Term 2022: $25

I expect revenues to climb 30% + in 2021 thanks to China market growth and entering new NFT fields combined with purchasing/acquiring new infrastructure and talent. BAOS is still being valued as a marketing company (undervalued) and has not capture any of the NFT/Crypto attention.

EDIT: This post is getting some backlash because this subreddit is anti-chinese plays. I am not advocating to toss 100% of your portfolio on this stock. Allocate a small portion and diversify your holdings. This stock is trading at its IPO price and has limited downside thanks to its cash position. Enter with a small portion and set a stop loss to test the waters. This stock is unknown due to the lack of PR's as it just got out of its quiet period. The upcoming PR about its NFT platform will attract new investors and make this rally. Feel free to sell at a gain once it does so or set a stop loss at your initial investment price and ride it out. Dismissing all Chinese investments is a awful investment strategy.

mmivok,,investing,post,1617852005,"New Position: Atlas Air WorldwideMy portfolio has a lot of technology and stocks that have performed well. As some of these stocks get near their all time highs again, I've been cutting down my exposure to some of them because some of them had grown to a large % of my portfolio (a good problem to have). As a result, I've built up some cash and have been looking for cheaper names of beaten down companies outside of technology. One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. 

\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. 

**Company Profile:**

The company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: 

ACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. 

Charter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. 

**2020 Financial Highlights:**

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith & Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. 

Right now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.","['AMZN', 'BLK']"

mlzyon,,investing,post,1617794893,"Investing: the future winners among car manufacturers and your opinionGreetings! I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

**VW** has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, [Frank Walliser](https://presskit.porsche.de/motorsport/en/mediaguide-2017/topic/gt-programs/porsche-gt-team/info/driver/dr-frank-steffen-walliser-porsche-gt-team-wec-gt-2017.html), at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

|**Toyota Motor Corp**|JPN|10|4 %|39 %|249|

* VW is a solid bet but they're probably riding higher on hype right now so I'm waiting to see if the price settles a bit lower before making a move.

* BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, etc. are luxury brands that aren't going anywhere but also aren't likely to be major movers in the transition. Their value is tied more to their brand than market share so I'm not particularly interested in them right now. Probably safe but not super exciting.

* I picked up shares of Ford because they're a major manufacturer and because of their stake in Rivian. Admittedly they're moving a bit slow on EVs compared to others but their share price is still low compared to others so it's a safer bet to see short term gains.

* One you didn't mention is GM which I like a lot because of their plans for Ultium. Building production lines for the parts and power train that they can supply for themselves and others seems like a very smart play.",['GM']

VW got a head start over most of their competition because of ""DieselGate"" scandal - when that all blew up they pulled some future ICE projects and went all-in on EV development, starting back in.  Also, some of the penalties they had to pay for DieselGate went towards developing EV charging stations (which can now help their EV sales.  Oh no, such punishment...)

Their bread and butter EV model, the Rav4-sized ID4, will be manufactured on *3 continents* and sold all over the globe.  They have a partnership with QS, with intentions to produce *solid state batteries in 4-5 years*, which could be a significant jump on the competition. 
 VW has gone all-in on this model because it simply *must* succeed for them.  They're not trying to peel away Tesla buyers, they're trying to get CR-V/Rav4 owners to make the switch to a ""normal"" feeling EV crossover.","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

Thoughts on space tech as an investment?

The Offering was made through a syndicate of underwriters led by BMO Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley Canada Limited and Scotiabank, as joint bookrunners, with Barclays Capital Canada Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Canaccord Genuity Corp., CIBC World Markets Inc., National Bank Financial Inc. and Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., as underwriters. 

With over 60 years of space innovation in Canada and a government injection of over 2 Billion dollars Canada has been making serious space news. Today MDA who is the largest benefactor of that investment finalized its initial public offer at $14 per share.

The timing bodes well for MDA as the company has also been active in creating jobs and opportunities for the growing earth observation market. It was [announced](https://techbomb.ca/aerospace/government-of-canada-launches-international-space-program-to-track-illegal-fishing/) last month that the Government of Canada intends to launch an international space program to track illegal fishing.

mm45l7,,investing,post,1617807980,"Drive Shack, the reopening play you never heard of**General Overview:**

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

**My Holdings**: 150 shares as of right now

**FINAL TLDR:** *The company has a lot of potential for growth. It's worth the effort of looking into them ahead of earnings in early May.*",['IR']

Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

The council’s launch comes as prices of many digital assets have surged, drawing in new mainstream investors and the banks and brokers that serve them. Earlier this year, the total market value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, touched $1 trillion for the first time.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

**Total Revenue of approximately $1.8 billion**  
**Net Income of approximately $730 million to $800 million**  
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

mlxyfn,gto69vo,investing,comment,1617789486," Hi there

I need advice and some serious talk.

I am currently sitting on a portfolio of

\- 45% ETF´s  
\- 40% high dividend stocks and reits and such

rest in individual stocks I picked and liked.

I want more growth as I want to reduce the time I need to get to a certain threshold.

I picked the dividend stocks mainly because of the high yield. the lowest yield I get is 4,5%. highest at 13,4%.

I know that

\- those high yields are probably not lasting forever

\- I miss out on growth of the actual securities

but also , ALL dividend securities are green since I bought them.

the lowest being +1,51% (OMF), the highest being 42,88% (OKE).  
the rest is between 8,7% 27,09% green.

what should I do ? sell at green, take the tax hit (which is about 25% of profits where I live -> germany)  
or keep those titles ?

currently I reinvest every dividend payout I get. but those also take a tax hit. so I am missing out on returns and not even benefitting from the full dividend payout...

I am open for all kinds of tips and suggestions.",['OKE']
mljfdc,,investing,post,1617736729,"S&P 500 Flirts With Record, But 'Overbought' Jitters Keep Lid on GainsThe S&P 500 continued to trade near record highs Tuesday, led by energy and consumer stocks, but some on Wall Street are calling for caution as the latest acceleration pushed stocks into ""overbought"" territory.    

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% after hitting a record high of 4,086.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14%, or 46 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.

""Watch the S&P 500 over the next few days for potential consolidation - that benchmark is now very overbought / extended on the short-term trading charts and is likely to see some profit taking ahead in our opinion,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. Initial support is touted in the 3975-to-4000 zone, the firm added.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

""Although we expect near-term volatility as 1Q earnings start on April 14, reflecting weak loan growth, margin pressure, lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonal factors, we remain positive on the bank group,"" Wedbush said.

Technology stocks, were roughly unchanged, with the fab 5 trading mixed, even as falling U.S. bond yields supported investor sentiment on longer-duration growth stocks.  

The U.S. 10-year slipped below 1.7% quote yields after trading in range of 1.67% to 1.72% in recent days. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was higher.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) struggled to get going after racking up a 6% gain on Monday, as investors digested a bearish note from Roth Capital.

Roth Capital said Tesla is only worth $150 a share and suggested the electric automaker was a ""minor player"" in the U.S. and European markets.","['APA', 'TSLA', 'BK', 'DOW', 'FANG', 'AMZN', 'DVN', 'MSFT', 'PNC', 'FB', 'AAPL', 'STT', 'SPGI', 'GOOGL', 'NDAQ']"

Skip the advertising lessons you see allover and those so called “I made millions doing this or I turned pennies into riches”... You should frown upon them.

Want to get good at stock market investing and trading? Be hands on. Learn as you go. You loose money, probably a lot of money, but you gain a lot of knowledge. You can mentally structure those loses into as a cost for “Self Taught Knowledge”.. Those loses are investments. They are not losses. Why? Well that money was destined to go somewhere. Either to daily cheeseburgers or someone rip-off instructors.. 

Instead you will be giving it to a market as a loan, knowing sooner or later, you are going to be getting it back with interest at a far higher rate than ever.

Now when you start earning profits from your mistakes, guess what, your head is going to go really up high. Why? You now have pride in achieving 2 major things:

1: Self Taught Skills

**Due Diligence:**

Low Cap Stock $35.9 mil. The companies valuation is in the 10s of millions. Last ER showed they had $22.3 mil in cash and they just did another direct offering of 3,245,977 shares for $37.3 million. In 2019, the yearly Operational Expenses were the were roughly $10 mil. Means this company is walking around with an estimated \~60 mil in cash; 6x the annual OPEX at the end of 2019. Along with $0 debt.

After the offering at $1.50 the stock price went from $2.60 to $1.18. Multiple times in this past year has the stock reach $5+. Mostly from PR pumps, but the companies tech is definitely moving in the right direction rather quickly.

ASTC has signed past government contracts and this stock has multiple lines of tech that are reaching the final stages. With the type of tech that have large government contracts written all over it. Myself having a decent idea of how businesses operate from the inside and the recent news that has been released it seems to me some big moves that require large amounts of raw cash (manufacturing on a massive scale) are already in place for this company.

**Things we know:**

**April 12th** \- Closed offering of 3,245,977 shares for $37.3 million at $1.50.

I only ask that you read this report in its entirety before drawing your conclusions because **nothing about this company is as it seems.**

\--------------------------------

**PART I - DILUTION, DEBT, DOUBT**

\--------------------------------

On its surface, KemPharm looks particularly depressing. A casual glance at the KMPH chart will show you their stock price seems to know only one direction. Down.

A deeper dive into their financial history doesn’t improve their outlook either. Dilution, debt, and doubt. The triple-Ds of woe that spell out doom for any company that dares to enter the biotech arena. Their earnings are dismal and their quarterly reports are depressing. Dreary forecasts and dreadful prospects detail a dismal decline of depleted reserves and desperate delusion.

In a word… dangerous.

So why would anyone invest in this company? Better yet, why would anyone spend a single moment of their valuable time researching this company when everything they need to know is right out there in the open? Had I looked at this company a few months ago I might have come to that exact conclusion...

But on March 3, 2021… everything changed.

[**Meet Azstarys**](https://azstarys.com)

Azstarys is KemPharm’s latest FDA-approved medication specifically formulated for the treatment of ADHD. A once daily pill of **serdexmethylphenidate** and **dexmethylphenidate**. This is undoubtably decent news but, despite the medication showing promising potential, this alone wasn’t enough to convince me to make my investment.

The first glimmer of potential that caught my eye appeared, like most things about this company, in the smallest of details. If you have ADHD as I do, you may have noticed that you’ve never heard of **SER**dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate, the more active isomer of methylphenidate, is in Focalin and Focalin XR but the **SER** is a new development.

Looking deeper into Azstarys, I noted that SERdexmethylphenidate was described as a **prodrug**.

And the only other ADHD med with that designation is **Vyvanse**.

I was familiar with Vyvanse because it was my prescription prior to Focalin XR. But I wasn’t familiar of why it was called a prodrug so I decided to dig a little deeper.

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

...until I found a thread...

A thread that led me all the way back to the year 2006. A year where a man by the name of Dr. Travis Mickle made a rather important discovery.

>“Prior to founding KemPharm, Dr. Mickle served as Director of Drug Discovery and CMC at New River Pharmaceuticals where he was the principal inventor of Vyvanse®, a prodrug of amphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Today, Vyvanse is the branded market share leader in the estimated $17 billion plus ADHD market. The success of Vyvanse along with a robust pipeline of prodrugs targeting ADHD, pain and thyroid dysfunctions, which Dr. Mickle was responsible for creating, led to New River Pharmaceuticals being acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals, PLC for $2.6 billion.”

Source: [https://kempharm.com/team/](https://kempharm.com/team/)

In 2006, after tendering his resignation to New River Pharmaceuticals, the MickleMeister founded KemPharm with the sole intention of producing a plethora of prodrugs. Shortly after his departure, New River Pharmaceuticals was purchased by Shire for the bargain price of $2.6 billion. I say bargain because Vyvanse now generates around $2 billion dollars in revenue every single year.

Subsequently, Shire was purchased by Takeda in 2019 for the slightly higher price of $62 billion but this information will come into play a little later.

**So this begs the question; how did Vyvanse, a single ADHD medication, create such eye-watering returns on an, at the time, equally eye-watering $2.6 billion dollar investment?**

The answer, once again, is hidden in the itty bitty details. Vyvanse is a **prodrug** of dextroamphetamine known as **LIS**dexamfetamine. And here is where the pattern finally begins to align (after 800 words of backstory, damn).

Basically, a prodrug is a modified version of a drug that attaches another molecule, a ligand in Azstarys’s case, that renders the active ingredient inert unless cleaved through your body's metabolic processes.

In summary, **it only work if you eat it.**

This has quite a few benefits. Not least of which is a longer duration as your body can only metabolize things so quickly due to the limitations of enzymatic action. This ""gating"" effect even has the potential to reduce side effects. **Essentially a prodrug can improve qualities of the base medication.**

But the more important distinction is that **you can patent it**.

Shire already had experience with ADHD medications. They’re flagship product Adderall XR had seen monumental success but was about to go off-patent. This would expose Shire to the profit-decimating world of generics and so they eyeballed Vyvanse, being the novel prodrug lisdexamfetamine, for its brand new patent. Considering Shire’s experienced sales team and established connections, converting Adderall users to Vyvanse would likely be as easy as informing doctor’s and pharmacies of Vyvanse’s improved qualities.

**SO WHAT?!**

“So what?” I hear you ask. Apples and oranges. That’s a different drug with a different company so what does it have to do with KemPharm and Azstarys? I promise you, all of this backstory was necessary to explain exactly why KemPharm has so much potential.

\--------------------------------

**PART II - CONTRACTS, CORIUM, CAPITAL**

\--------------------------------

Azstarys will be brought to market Summer 2021 through their partner company Corium Inc.

[**Meet Corium**](https://corium.com)

The sales contract between the companies offers up to $590M in sales and regulatory milestone guarantees in addition to tiered royalty payments ranging from \~9% to \~25%. This contract was recently renegotiated from $468M to $590M with a new higher top-level royalty tier and the addition of 4 new sales milestones guarantees in exchange for $28M less on the upfront. All in all, a decent agreement. Not earth-shattering but probably good enough to keep KemPharm afloat for the foreseeable future.

**But this still isn’t enough to warrant an investment.**

Guarantees mean nothing unless the drug can sell. Sure, Azstarys is a prodrug but the performance of Vyvanse can’t guarantee the success of Azstarys especially considering that Corium doesn’t have the sales experience of Shire.

**…but what if they did?**

>“We all know that having the product is key, but you also have to have a team that can effectively ramp up the distribution in order to be a blockbuster. More than a decade ago, Vyvanse was picked up by Shire. Shire had an ‘ace team,’ led by **Perry Sternberg,** that did a superb job in commercialization.”

Source: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera)

The current CEO of Corium is **Perry Sternberg**. The very same Perry Sternberg that spearheaded the commercialization of Vyvanse during his tenure at Shire. That alone raises an eyebrow but I invite you to go to Corium’s website and look at their “Leadership” page: [https://corium.com/leadership.html](https://corium.com/leadership.html)

Tell me if you can spot the pattern:

Robyn Lynch, Head of Corporate Strategy - **Former Chief of Staff for U.S. Commercial Business and Neuroscience Division at Shire.**

John Miller, CFO - **Former Head of Finance for Global Commercial at Shire.**

John Neeley, Head of Market Access - **Former Head of Market Access at Shire.**

Jamie Spaeth, Head of HR - **Former Head of HR at Shire.**

When I saw this I couldn't help but ask myself, ""Why the hell are all these former Shire heads now working at Corium?""

The answer… **Gurnet Point Capital.**

>Travis Mickle, CEO: ""Why are we co-hosting this event today with our partner Corium? We actually entered into a worldwide license with Gurnet Point Capital that was announced back in September of 2019. Corium is a GPC portfolio company, and they have been assigned the rights to commercialize this product for GPC and for KemPharm. \[…\] We're excited about this, because through our license process, to look for the right partner, certainly, at one point Shire would have made a lot of sense. Certainly, Takeda had their own agendas, and we are so fortunate that Perry and much of his team has landed at Corium and they've had the foresight to bring in a product like KP415. Certainly, this is the team that knows how to advance a product like this, and it's a very exciting opportunity.”

Ok... **so** **who is Gurnet Point Capital?**

[**Meet Gurnet Point Capital**](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com)

Gurnet Point Capital (GPC) is a healthcare fund founded by **Ernesto Bertarelli**, former CEO of Serono.

>“The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialization and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies. It is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole.  
>  
>Consistent with the amount of capital, time and energy that it dedicates, Gurnet Point Capital will generally seek to be, over time, the majority – or at least principal - investor in each of its companies.”

Source: [https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about)

In late 2018 Gurnet Point Capital purchased Corium for a flat fee of $500 million. The former CEO, Peter Staple, was replaced with Perry Sternberg in April of 2019. But it wasn’t just Sternyburgy that came along for the ride. GPC made a point to acquire his entire team. **Specifically the team that made Vyvanse a commercial success.** So why did they feel the need to recruit this exact team from Shire?

The answer… **Azstarys.**

Obviously this has been a lot of information so let me try to summarize everything I’ve detailed so far:

1. KemPharm looks ugly.
2. KemPharm’s drug Azstarys approved on March 3, 2021.
3. Azstarys is a prodrug.
4. The only other ADHD prodrug is Vyvanse.
5. Vyvanse was made by Travis Mickle.
6. Travis Mickle is the CEO of KemPharm.
7. Azstarys will be sold through a partnership with Corium.
8. Corium is has the Shire team that sold Vyvanse.
9. Corium is owned by Gurnet Point Capital.
10. Gurnet Point Capital is owned by Ernesto Bertarelli.

The thread is long and winding but the details are out there in the open. You can look up and verify every single piece of information so far and I encourage you to do so and come to your own conclusions. But I assure you that all of this information was needed to understand this next part.

**PART III - MARKETS, MONEY, MATH**

\--------------------------------

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE PERSONAL OPINIONS —**

What follows from this point on is my investment thesis and represents the reason why I decided to make a substantial investment into KemPharm. I want to be very clear that **this is not financial advice nor a recommendation that you should invest in this company. As always, do your own research.**

With that warning out of the way, let's talk about **the stock.**

During KemPharm’s latest Earnings Call on March 11, 2021, Travis Mickle and team detailed the various changes that have taken place just in the past few months:

1. Stock relisted on NASDAQ effective JAN 8, 2021.
2. No debt as of FEB 8, 2021.
3. $77M Cash on Hand as of MAR 10, 2021
4. 28.3M Shares Outstanding as of MAR 10, 2021
5. 38.6M Fully diluted shares as of MAR 10, 2021

Source: [https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020)

All of these events occurred in Q1 and have led to considerable confusion across the internet in regards to the accuracy of information regarding KMPH. But taking these new developments into account, a very different picture begins to form in regards to KemPharm’s future.

The current stock price as of the very moment I’m writing this is $8.70.

Assuming a full dilution of all 38.6M shares that gives a market cap of \~$340M. Accounting for Cash on Hand, that means that \~$260M of this company’s worth is attributed to Azstarys, Apadaz, their pipeline, their technology, and Dr. Mickle’s brain in a jar.

NOTE: This doesn't account for cash due from converted warrants and approval guarantees which could net an additional \~$80M and bring their CoH to \~$150M. This will be clarified in the next ER.

Taking all of this into consideration, I asked myself 2 questions:

1. What market share MUST Azstarys capture in order to sustain KemPharm’s operations for the foreseeable future?
2. Will KemPharm be able to innovate with future products?

To answer the first question, I needed to gain a better understanding of the ADHD market as a whole. The \~$18B industry currently has 21 existing treatments spread across 3 primary classes:

1. Amphetamines
2. Methylphenidates
3. Non-stimulants

The current largest player in the field is Vyvanse at a whopping **13%** of the TOTAL market and **18%** of the stimulant category (class 1 & 2). Competitors like Focalin XR & Concerta comprise about **1%** each.

So we have some comparatives for market performance but I still prefer to take the pessimistic approach. My question is, what is the bare minimum performance required to simply **NOT GO BANKRUPT**.

According to KemPharm they have a projected **Annual** **Cash Burn of \~$4M** [**(source)**](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call)

Considering this and assuming a low-ball **10% royalty rate** (\~8-25% potential) with only **5% of the potential $550M** in milestone guarantees received over a 10 year period, how much market size would Azstarys have to capture in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt in a **worst case scenario?**

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE NAPKIN MATH —**

(operating expenses) = (total annual market)(required market share)(royalty rate) + ((milestone payments)(percent received))/(10 year period)

x = required market share

($4,000,000) = ($18,000,000,000)(x)(0.1) + (($550,000,000)(0.05))/(10)

4,000,000 = 1,800,000,000x + 2,750,000

1,250,000 = 1,800,000,000x

x = 0.00069 = **0.069% required market share**

This obviously relies on guesswork and doesn’t account for things like CAGR, taxes, manufacturing costs, or inflation, so let’s make it even harder for KemPharm and **double the required market share.**

So in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt, assuming they sit on their ass and do nothing until the end of time, Azstarys needs just **0.14%** of the market or **$25.2M** in average annual sales over a 10 year period to earn an income of $4M. Obviously this ignores the scaling royalty rate and any further sales milestones but I prefer err on the side of caution when making wild, speculative assumptions. Helps to keep things in perspective.

So that's the bare minimum amount that Azstarys is allowed to suck before KemPharm implodes. Should Azstarys manage to perform on the same level as the lower competitors at around **1%**  you would certainly see a rise in KemPharm's stock price even with a below-average P/E ratio. And given their partner Corium's experience with the commercialization of Vyvanse there's very little reason to believe that this goal couldn't be achieved.

**Furthermore,** **I believe that Azstarys will exceed it.**

\--------------------------------

**PART IV - ALL AHEAD AZSTARYS**

\--------------------------------

**It is my personal belief** that KemPharm has crossed the threshold of uncertainty and has secured the financial stability necessary to confidently pursue the development of exponentially more prodrugs.

**I believe** that KemPharm's partner Corium has the ideal combination of experience and financial backing to optimize Azstarys's success.

**I believe** that Azstarys offers unique benefits that will improve the quality of care for patients with ADHD, myself included.

**I believe that KemPharm is** **extremely undervalued**.

To view KemPharm as a company in peril is simply a matter of outdated information. It seems to me that their value is hidden beneath layers of historical uncertainty and investor pessimism which makes it an excellent buying opportunity for those capable and willing to see its potential.

The arguments that Azstarys will fail to be competitive against its competitors or generics doesn’t hold water considering the fact that Azstarys **has** **no therapeutic equivalents** [**(source)**](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process) and is patented until 2037.

An additional point is that Azstarys was approved for all ages 6 and up [**(source)**](https://www.azstarys.com) instead of just 6-17 which was a surprise inclusion upon approval and serves to further expand the potential market.

The FDA also included a section in the label with clinical data suggesting that Azstarys has **reduced impedance of childhood growth and development** [**(Section 6.1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf). This particular issue is often cited as the primary complaint from parents of children with ADHD.

Critics of Azstarys focus heavily on the obscurity of it’s potential duration **(the often referenced 30/13)** and consider the inclusion of a chart without this specific language on the label as sufficient cause for dismissal. To me, this argument comes from a place of ignorance and a severe lack of perspective. Yes, certain terms of the sales agreement are contingent on this specific language but this point has yet to be confirmed or denied.

Furthermore this language's effect on actual sales is largely overestimated. All extended release products are long lasting by design but the key differentiating factor between Azstarys and its competitors is that it is, in fact, a prodrug. And as a prodrug its primary differentiation between it and other medications is the **smooth downward efficacy ramp** as the body metabolizes the medication at a consistent rate. [**(Section 12.3 Figure 1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf)

To put it plainly, other extended release products are equivalent to a **caffeine crash**. I know this because I experience it every single day.

The more interesting takeaway is that this medication’s formula and prodrug status allows it to differentiate from not just Methylphenidate products, **but from Vyvanse itself.**

The primary criticism for Vyvanse is its slow onset [**(Up to 1.5 Hours)**](https://www.psycom.net/vyvanse-lisdexamfetamine) but Azstarys is formulated with instant release dexmethylphenidate alongside serdexmethylphenidate for faster onset. **This opens up the possibility that Azstarys won’t just be competing for market share on the Methylphenidate side but may be able to cross over to the Amphetamine side and capture market share directly from Vyvanse.**

And while I don’t assume that its performance will be equivalent to Vyvanse, it is impossible to ignore the potent combination of product and people at play. **Corium’s recruitment of the former Shire team has given Azstarys the best possible chance to succeed. Who better to have on your product's side than the very same people that made Vyvanse the leading ADHD medication in the business.**

And as a final anecdote, I have already spoken to my doctor about Azstarys and we both agree that it will be my next medication. Not because I believe in the company or want to help with sales. But because I've tried just about every medication on the market and want the best treatment possible. **And Azstarys just seems better.**

So that just leaves one last question: can KemPharm continue to innovate?

The answer… **Travis Mickle.**

While there is no data in the world that can anticipate the future actions of any one person, I have a gut feeling that there might just be some magic left in the old Mickster. I’ll end this overly long DD with a simple quote and leave it to you to decide for yourself:

>“It is akin to the Golden Goose that will just keep laying golden egg after golden egg. Dr. Mickle has stated that ‘given sufficient funds, he doesn’t have enough life left, to develop all of the possibilities.’ This is perhaps the most valuable asset that KemPharm possesses.”

1. Why invest so early? I don't see any reason to get in now, unless I missed something. I'd wait closer to a catalyst, no?
2. Azstarys's chemical make-up looks interesting but as somebody who did not like Ritalin myself, I am curious how big of an impact it will make. EDIT: to clarify, Azstarys's chemical makeup is extremely similar to Ritalin's: it may be indistinguishable to some folks (I don't know whether it will or not, I am just basing this off my limited knowledge of pharmacology).
3. Drug companies seem less hot than they used to be, if it goes up it will probably go up to $15 or so, not back to $300?

mr8wrs,,StockMarket,post,1618467351,"A deep dive into Coinbase’s stock In light of Coinbase’s ($COIN) direct listing, I wanted to share a deep dive post on the company

 [A deep dive into Coinbase's stock - DecentraNews ](https://decentra.news/a-deep-dive-into-coinbases-stock/)

To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general. I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile. Since 2010, there were 4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years. Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and now there seems to be some correlation.

Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices. This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility. Since 2016, 7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time.

This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices. For example, you can see that volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020 but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically.

Then I went 81 at $338. If anything has taught us from yesterday, it is that this stock is volatile. Here's my tip for day traders, swing traders, and long term investors.

It really depends on how the market will react to the stock on the morning of Apr. 15th. That way, we can get a better glimpse of the fixed price of the stock. But whatever happens on the 15th, we know that the stock is going to go up no matter what. For day traders: buy the stock around 10:00am or before the market closes and sell during pre-market. Granted, we don't know how the market will move. However, we do know that as of right now, Coinbase is valued around 20\~30 billion over what it is actually worth. Day traders should be looking at the pre market boost over the next few days. However, since the stock is so expensive, I recommend going long term for this one. The return in one day won't be that high. 6% at best.

Swing traders should look long term as well. For those that bought under $350, you need to play close attention to where the market is taking this stock. The way I see it, in the upcoming week, the highest it will ever go is like $420. There is still a lot of variables like the fact that this stock is just simply not worth the value the market is setting it at. So instead, swing traders should look monthly, which i still estimate is going to be around 12% profit.

Long term traders, just forget about the stock! Like buying a Bugatti, this is a relatively expensive investment. The next time you should really care is when it hits the news, saying that it is valued more than S.P. 500 or GS. As of right now, the market continues to correct the price so that won't happen for quite sometime. I saw give it two years then sell and get in again and hold for a decade. Crypto currencies operate in cycles, and I don't think this is an exception. We should be expecting a 'crypto-winter'. But within a decade, this stock could really go to the moon if all the concerns addressing the stock are put at ease.

Here's what I think. I think the stock will continue to correct its price until the end of the week. And by that time, I estimate it will be around $280\~$330. A big gap, but with little info on how the market will react yet, that's the best I can give. I say even in the month, the highest it will go is $420. So go LONG is my takeaway. Again, this is just what I think so investors should still hold true to their instincts and keep watching the news.","['GPS', 'GS']"

MDU Resources Group, Inc.’s MDU two-platform business model, strategic acquisitions, capital investments in the electric and natural gas utility plus improving backlog are its key tailwinds. Also, the company boasts enough liquidity to meet its near-term obligations.

Some key highlights on why I think it might be a good pick up for your portfolio

**Consistent long-term growth at 9.3% EBITDA CAGR and 16.7% EPS CAGR**

* Stocks with higher earnings-per-share growth rates are generally more desired by investors than those with slower earnings-per-share growth rates. This is a good sign for MDU and has a decent shot at beating earnings upcoming in early May
* Balance of cyclical and counter cyclical business with almost a 50/50 split between construction and regulated energy. this bodes well for the long run and will likely be a stable performer in the market

**Runway of attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities**

* Organic Growth: We are all familiar with the infrastructure spending bill that was passed in the UIS and MDU stand to benefit from this.
* Inorganic Growth: **MDU Resources (MDU) Arm Buys Mt. Hood Rock, Expands in Portland (**[**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdu-resources-mdu-arm-buys-163304894.html)**)** These investments will be aimed at enhancing the reliability of the company’s services, thus enabling it to serve an increasing customer base, effectively. MDU Resources anticipates its electric and natural gas utility segment to see a CAGR of 5% and expects its customer base to expand 1-2%, annually.

**Improving ROIC driven by rigorous capital allocation process**

* Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.
* A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%. MDU Resources Group's ROIC % is 6.29% (calculated using TTM income statement data).
* MDU Resources Group generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.

**Valuation**

I find MDU to be attractively priced at $31.29, with a blended PE of 15.9. This sits below MDU's historical PE of 19.4 over the past decade,

Analysts also express a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $34.33, implying a 10% upside potential from the current share price.

**Earnings**

Earnings are forecast to grow 6.74% per year and Earnings grew by 16.6% over the past year. If this trend continues, we will likely see a rise in the share price

**Insider Trading**

Significant insider buying over the last year with a majority of shares purchased in May 2020. This would make sense considering the price dropped off a cliff just a month prior. The management team knew it was a bargain and acted on the low share price

# Risks

**Biden’s Infrastructure Plan** \- While I see potential tailwinds for MDU's construction business from Biden's proposed infrastructure plan, there's no guarantee that such a proposal will pass. The construction business is more cyclical than the regulated utility business, and adds complexity risk to MDU's business model.

**Mild Dilution** \- MDU relies on both equity and debt to fund capital projects. This includes $100M in expected equity issuances this year, which will be mildly dilutive to shareholders

# TLDR

I'm encouraged by the impressive earnings it generated amidst a challenging economy. Based o some of the key factors and management guidance I see continued growth for MDU for the foreseeable future. I continue to find the valuation to be attractive and the dividend to be well-covered and safe. Consider looking at MDU and potentially adding it to your portfolio.

mqzw25,,StockMarket,post,1618433935,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 14, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC)blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

 [Should you invest in IPO's on day one? - DecentraNews -](https://decentra.news/should-you-invest-in-ipos-on-day-one/)

After the IPO of Coinbase ($COIN) yesterday, you might be left wondering if you should’ve bought it? (Well probably not, since it had a [rather underwhelming first day of trading](https://decentra.news/coinbases-rocket-runs-out-of-fuel-at-launch/)). Or maybe you bought at yesterday’s top and you are wondering if you should’ve waited a little longer before going in balls deep.

If you are in the stock for the long term and believe the company has fundamental value, then the early volatility and the risk of price drops are of less concern. But for most of us, an IPO investment is just too risky. Especially on day one. Either way, if you still consider buying an IPO, you should do your own research and due diligence.

Either way, most of the time, it's better to wait at least one day before buying a stock after an IPO.

Happy trading or holding!",

***ImgAssist AI Software Achieves 0.94 AUC After Utilizing Extensive Dataset of Images Collected During Stage 1 of ATLAS AI Project***

TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Perimeter Medical Imaging AI, Inc. (TSX-V:PINK)(OTC:PYNKF) (FSE:4PC) (“Perimeter” or the “Company”), a medical technology company driven to transform cancer surgery with ultra-high-resolution, real-time, advanced imaging tools to address high unmet medical needs, today announced significant progress within its ATLAS AI Project, an initiative aimed at advancing Perimeter’s next-gen artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools through clinical development. Perimeter’s proprietary “ImgAssist” AI technology has now been trained with more than 400 volumes of images of excised breast tissue collected during the first stage of its ATLAS AI project.

Importantly, Perimeter’s proprietary algorithm has achieved key sensitivity and specificity benchmarks, including an AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.94, which is a measure of how well the algorithm can differentiate between suspicious and non-suspicious breast tissue areas. This significant milestone supports the advancement of the ATLAS AI Project to the next stage, which involves a “reader study” to conduct an evaluation of clinician performance when using ImgAssist offline (not during a surgery) to interpret images from breast conserving surgeries. It is anticipated that the data from the reader study will support development plans to advance Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System with ImgAssist into a larger, randomized pivotal study later this year to evaluate its safety and effectiveness.

Jeremy Sobotta, Perimeter’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are pleased to reach this important milestone within our ATLAS AI project, having achieved these exciting results with our proprietary AI algorithm. We are driven by our belief that Perimeter’s novel imaging platform with AI has the potential to transform cancer surgery and reduce costs in the healthcare system.”

**About the ATLAS AI Project**

Perimeter is advancing its proprietary, next-gen artificial intelligence technology and machine learning tools through clinical development under its ATLAS AI project, which is made possible, in part, by a $7.4 million grant awarded by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), a leading state body funding cancer research. The first stage of the ATLAS AI Project involves collecting images of breast tissue samples from patients at leading pathology centers in Texas. These images are precisely labeled and signed off by a board-certified pathologist. In the second stage of the project, the Perimeter team is using this labeled dataset of breast tissue images to train and test Perimeter’s AI algorithm, and further test its efficacy in a reader study. In the final stage of the project, Perimeter intends to conduct a randomized, multi-site, pivotal study to evaluate the Perimeter OCT Imaging System with ImgAssist AI against the current standard of care and assess the impact on re-operation rates for patients undergoing breast conservation surgery.

**About Perimeter Medical Imaging AI, Inc.**

[Perimeter Medical Imaging AI](http://www.perimetermed.com/) (TSX-V:PINK)(OTC:PYNKF)(FSE:4PC) is a Toronto-based company with U.S. headquarters in Dallas, Texas that is developing and commercializing advanced imaging tools that allow surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists to visualize microscopic tissue structures during a clinical procedure. Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System provides clinicians with real-time, ultra-high-resolution, sub-surface image volumes of the margin (1-2 mm below the surface) of an excised tissue specimen. The ability to visualize microscopic tissue structures during a clinical procedure in addition to standard of care tissue assessment for decision making during the procedure has the potential to result in better long-term outcomes for patients and lower costs to the healthcare system. Perimeter’s OCT Imaging System is cleared by the FDA as an imaging tool in the evaluation of excised human tissue microstructure by providing two-dimensional, cross-sectional, real-time depth visualization, with image review manipulation software for identifying and annotating regions of interest. In addition, Perimeter is advancing its proprietary, next-gen artificial intelligence technology and machine learning tools through clinical development under its ATLAS AI project, which is made possible, in part, by a $7.4 million grant awarded by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). Perimeter’s ticker symbol “PINK” is a reference to the pink ribbons used during Breast Cancer Awareness Month by the Canadian Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society, driving home the company’s dedication to helping surgeons, radiologists and pathologists use Perimeter’s imaging technology and AI in the fight against breast cancer, which is estimated to [account for 30%](https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics) of all female cancer diagnoses this year.

Anyway could someone explain to me what happens now: I bought 1 contract of NFLX $700 Call 5/15 buy (or it says it’s pending as of now). So does this mean if the stock price is over $700 on May 15th (which is obviously highly unlikely: NFLX is $412 rn) that I would make a bunch of money?

If NFLX becomes $701. You will make $100 ( $1 x100). 
But since it cost you $18 already. Your profit is actually only $82. 

So, as you said, your chance of making a bunch of money doesn’t look good.  But hey, if Netflix becomes $800.  You will make $100 per share. You make $10k!

So good luck with that.  


Now if NFLX really goes your way and climb up $20 dollars per day. you will most likely make money before may 15th. 

Because let’s say by may 1st. NFLX is already at $600. Your contract will suddenly becomes quite possible.  Same contract could cost $400 instead of $18.  You can sell it to someone at that time and you make $400 - $18 = $382.",['NFLX']

mr2vzs,gukpmf6,StockMarket,comment,1618464231,"Buying a call gives you the option to buy the stock

Buying a put gives you the option to sell the stock

Options have their own value based on a shitload of factors. They're able to be traded seperate from stocks. That's important bc they're derivatives and that's what reality makes them valuable.

You don't have to wait until expiration to sell the option or exercise it. (It's called an option bc you've got the option)

The more rapidly (volatility) a stock moves in price relative to it's ""normal"" movement the more valuable the option becomes. If that volatility slows down the option will likely lose value depending on which strike price you picked, when you bought it and at what price.

IMO doing something is the best way to learn but I really suggest watching some videos and learning the basic greeks. It'll save you money.

In the case of this particular NFLX option my advice would be to sell if you see any profit and have a limit your willing to lose it it doesn't go your way. Keep learning and asking questions nothing wrong with that at all. Only a fool wouldn't ask questions.",['NFLX']

mrbk3c,,StockMarket,post,1618480510,"CryptoSwap Finance - Bullish DeFi ICO of 2021 – Everything you need to know - Features Overview - Products launch in May. Gain 50x short-term.CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange that runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and enables uses to SWAP BEP-20 tokens in a trustless and permissionless manner. The platform is fast, cheap, and user-friendly. CryptoSwap Finance has many features such as farming, staking, and trading exchange that enable users to earn and win tokens. 
That is CryptoSwap in summary. In this article, we will look at the features of CryptoSwap and the problems it solves.

Blockchain and smart chain technology have opened a floodgate of innovation. With BSC, it is now possible to develop decentralized finance projects (daaps) with unique features such as decentralized exchanges (DEX), firming, staking, liquid pools, and lottery, which enable users to earn and win tokens in various ways. CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that offers these features, among others that that enable users to earn higher with the least transaction fee and high transaction speed.

Products:

1. Exchange/Trade Platform
CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that utilizes automated market-making (AMM) instead of the conventional order book. Users can trade various tokens on the platforms against a liquidity pool (LP). LP providers, who are exchange users, add funds to the liquidity pool and receives LP tokens in return. The tokens can be used to reclaim shares of funds, with a portion of the trading fees. The exchange has an intuitive user interface that even novice traders can use.  

2. Yield Farming and Staking
CryptoSwap Finance enables users to deposit and lock their funds in processes that earn rewards in CryptoSwap Finance Token (CSF), the native token. There are many pools where you can stake your funds. You can earn up to 20 times in reward with the main CSF/BNB pool. You can also stake your CSF tokens to earn a reward in other tokens. You can cash out the rewards or reinvest them. 

3. Lottery
Users can participate in the CSF lottery and earn rewards. To participate, use your CSF tokens to buy the tickets. Each ticket goes for 5 CSF. You can participate with a single ticket or buy more tickets to increase your chances of winning. The jackpot winner, whose ticket digits matches all the lottery number, earns 50% of the entire lottery pool. There is a reward for those whose tickets match 3 or 2 numbers. 

4. Voting
The decision-making in CryptoSwap is done through the voting process. The community members are allowed to propose ideas and vote on them. The cryptocurrency team reviews the proposals, move the ones with strong community support to the core level where the team determines the results, and announce it to the CryptoSwap community.

5. Initial Farm Offering
Users can buy tokens offered by other startup projects in a new sale model – IFO. You can use your CSF-BNB LP tokens to acquire new tokens. After the sales, the project gets BNB tokens, while you get project tokens. CSF tokens equivalent to half the total funds raised are burned.

Final Thought  

The above core features of CryptoSwap enable the users to earn and win more tokens. The users can also directly take part in the voting process to suggest ways of improving the project. CryptoSwap is designed to ensure that the users obtain optimal benefits.

mqxtu2,,StockMarket,post,1618427955,"Tesla: The Sustainable Energy Technology Company Accelerating the World's Transition to Sustainable EnergyMany view Tesla as just an electric vehicle automotive company, but I believe they are much more.  They are developing sustainable energy technology that will enable all of humanity to live on Earth sustainably long-term.  This is all because Tesla has designed a trifecta of sustainable energy products: products for energy consumption, energy production, and energy storage.  Despite Tesla's incredible run in its stock price from less than $100 two years ago to over $700 now, I still believe Tesla is incredibly undervalued on a long-term basis, as I believe Tesla will be the world's most valuable company by 2030 with an eventual market cap of at least $5 Trillion.  The world NEEDS sustainable energy technology, and Tesla is the leader in providing this technology.  The value of such technology is unfathomable, and demand for all their products will only increase exponentially with time as the climate change crisis worsens.  

If you want to learn more about Tesla, how they make money, and what I believe their future will be, listen in to my latest podcast will I break all of this down.  If you're not a shareholder I recommend you become one, as Tesla's story is just beginning.

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with SBE late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum, + ESG and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

(IT guy views):

Maybe, I don't have the full picture but it seems their products are only ""put a cool UI and automate some data tasks"".

All  the things I saw in their presentation are perfectly manageable if you  hire proper IT people. We don't need UI to prepare data from different  sources, link the data, run IA models etc. We can do it in days or weeks  not years like they are trying to sell you.

Maybe they will faciliate some tasks for companies without good sized or skilled IT teams, I dont' know...

Their  UI seems very interesting and well designed, I can give that. But I m  sure we will be quicker with a simple linux terminal (joke) :)

I  see their products like ""Channable"" for data flow management but with  all the IA Hype (\*\*Channable is a small tool to prepare data to be sent  to shopping marketplaces).

Like I  said, maybe I don't have the full picture based on their presentation  and I don't know any figures related to their valuation etc. But for a  pure technical point, I don't see anything in the core plateform that is  a big whaooo effect (except their UI).

If  I need to think about a road : they maybe will be a 3d engine like  Unreal Engine or Unity but for data linking, preparation, and IA models  (the tool that groups up the techs in a simpler way).. but I have a  doubt.

mqs127,,StockMarket,post,1618411417,"ZKIN 15m OutlookSince the last outlook the price of ZKIN has gained almost 7% in value as it's being traded back above $7 per share.

A first bull signs start to show up as volume has increased sharply today. We've already had the same amount of trades today by now, that we had yesterday!

A volume spike led to a price spike to $8 per share. A strong buying demand has arrived as the price broke above $7.00 and change the overall trend to uptrend. 

The price failed to hold at $8 which would be expected from such sharp move from a downtrend, but it has managed to find a support at 20 and 50 EMA's, which means that the 15m uptrend is likely to begin!

This will lead the long almost 6 days long 15 minute downtrend which made the price of ZKIN very oversold. Same as before.

This is no more any early optimism, but it seems like another uptrend as we've expected is forming.

The key support is located at $7.00, where the EMA's are located. A break below this support would lead to a prolonged downtrend, which ZKIN's price can't really handle in order to remain in overall uptrend. Maybe one more dip, but it's unlikely.

RSI continues to see some bullish pressure as it's in a trend of higher highs and lows. A break above 60 as you may know by now, will bring bullish momentum, pushing the price back to $8 area possibly.

MACD is in a buying wave with no further plans, that she would like to tell us on this time frame.

Overall trend has changed into an uptrend!

mqjkxa,,StockMarket,post,1618376387,"My insights on why Hyliion's approach is brilliant! HYLNHyliion is approaching the electrification of trucks in a very innovative and elegant way.

Problem statement:
1. A typical truck is driven about 500-600 miles a day, carrying about 80,000 pounds of payload. If the truck has to be completely electrified, the battery size required would be huge (probably more than half the payload). Which would be an immense waste as to transport the same amount of goods, the number of fully electric trucks required would be double than the diesel ones.

2. For a fully electrified truck, the charging times would be pretty high as well. That means the trucks would have to be idle for a long time, thus losing more money. 

3. The electricity required to charge the batteries in an EV comes from the grid, which is primarily produced using natural gas in a powerplant. That means there are transmission losses to account for to transport the electricity from the powerplant to the charging stations.


Hyliion's Solution:
1. They want to use a smaller battery pack so that they can still allow the truck to carry most of it's original payload.

2. Having an onboard electricity generator from natural gas is another benefit to cut down on transmission losses.

3. Faster charging times would allow the truck to travel long distances before it needs to refuel, which means almost no idle time. Also, if they use multiple battery modules, they can use half of them to drive the truck and charging the remaining half to be used afterwards, thus making it a continuous cycle.

4. They plan to use RNG, which makes their trucks net carbon negative, as it is produced by decaying organic matter in the landfills.

5. Eventually they also want to replace RNG with Hydrogen fuel, which would make it even more environment friendly.


Technical Analysis:

Energy density of
Li ion battery: 100-265 Wh/kg

RNG: 14,888.9 Wh/kg

Even after assuming only 10% (very conservative estimate) of the energy from RNG is being converted to the energy stored in the batteries, a truck with RNG would still be 5-6 times more energy efficient.


Conclusion:
Unless we find a way to make batteries more energy dense, it doesn't make any sense to have a fully electrified 18 wheeler. And that's why Hyliion's approach to solving this problem is absolutely brilliant!!

Also, a fully electrified truck is no more greener or environment friendly, if that electricity is ultimately coming from the natural gas powered plant. In comparison, Hyliion's trucks would be much better.",

Stocks traded mixed on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) gaining while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly. Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season. 

In a joint statement posted to Twitter [(check out the thread here](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778)), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.”

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

Hit my exit on Medtronic at open today, that one I picked up when Cramer talked about it. I'm sure somebody will be mad that Cramer was right about something.🤣

Oshkosh is looking good, but how certain is their USPS contract? Does anybody know the details on that,  and the rumored review of the award?

It's easy to imagine Square doing really well in the reopening and making a lot of money, but a glance at the chart... they were already a popular choice with small business, their valuation seems a bit silly already to me.👼",

It’s for the future kids of the world to have good shit to watch that won’t subconsciously turn them into racists, sexists, or violent retards. It’ll turn them into little Elons and Warren Buffets. Face it we need this cause the past few generations have fucked things up. Probably cause we watched Ren and Stimpy and rotted our brains.

2. Keep Stan Lee alive through future shows created by the man who made Marvel and X-Men. The guy has almost 100 unreleased characters that could turn into another great franchise like the Avengers. We need to support them into making it big!

3. Future of Kartoons!!! We’re not just taking children’s Kartoons. If GNUS makes it big enough then they’ll start to roll out live action movies, and more teen/mature rated content just like good ole Disney is starting to do. It’s be awesome if Kartoon Channel became the place for Anime (DBZ, Naruto, One Piece), adult cartoons (Rick & Morty, South Park, Family Guy, and EXCLUSIVE Cartoon/Anime Movies. You know how Netflix and Disney have blockbuster high budget movies/shows? We’ll think of that but with cartoons/Anime!!!!

4. Getting rich. Face it we all buy a stock to get rich. This one has SO much potential I wish people would actually go research how much potential this stock has! They’ve got NO DEBT, 150 Million in cash, and making power moves all over the chess board with acquiring companies and people!

mqc9b9,guf2wlm,StockMarket,comment,1618350112,"Coinbase, the American cryptocurrency trading giant, has set a reference price for its direct listing at $250 per share. According to the company’s most recent SEC filing, it has a fully-diluted share count of 261.3 million, giving the company a valuation of $65.3 billion. Using a simple share count of 196,760,122 provided in its most recent S-1/A filing, Coinbase would be worth a slimmer $49.2 billion.
Regardless of which share count is used to calculate the company’s valuation, it’s new worth is miles above its final private price set in 2018 when the company was worth $8 billion.
Immediate chatter following the company’s direct listing reference price was that the price could be low. While Coinbase will not suffer usual venture capital censure if its shares quickly appreciate as it is not selling stock in its flotation, it would still be slightly humorous if its set reference price was merely a reference to an overly conservative estimate of its worth.
Its private backers are in for a bonanza either way. Around four years ago in 2017 Coinbase was worth just $1.6 billion, according to Crunchbase data. For investors in that round, let alone its earlier fundraises, the valuation implied by a $250 per-share price represents a multiple of around 40x from the price that they paid.
The Coinbase direct listing was turbocharged recently when the company provided a first-look at its Q1 2021 performance. As TechCrunch reported at the time, the company’s recent growth was impressive, with revenue scaling from $585.1 million in Q4 2020, to $1.8 billion in the first three months of this year. The new numbers set an already-hot company’s public debut on fire.
Place your bets now concerning where Coinbase might open, and how high its value may rise. It’s going to be quite the show.",

As we all know crypto swings wildly, so now imagine being a hedge fund and getting a margin call that you can't meet because your portfolio is mostly made up of crypto. 

Crypto's volatility likely will lead to margin calls, which will trigger fire sales, panic selling won't be far behind and then crash. How many Archegos' are we going to see this year, and how many more in the next? What happens when the fed changes monetary policy, raises interest rates and adds more f.u.d. to the already stewing pot of uncertainty? 

Crypto doesn't have to be the catalyst that brings it all down, but typical stocks don't fluctuate as wildly which means there is less risk.

mr1rrv,gujnrpn,StockMarket,comment,1618442640,"Okay there are a few points here that I'm going to address.

1.) Big banks and large hedge funds have been over leveraging for a long time. It's not great that they're doing it with Crypto but they're probably only doing it with Bitcoin and Ethereum which don't swing nearly as much as other coins.

&#x200B;

2.) No large hedge fund or big bank is going to have their portfolio mostly made up of Crypto. 1%-5% maybe. Some of the smaller hedge funds might have like 20% in but even that seems like its reaching pretty hard.

&#x200B;

3.) Crypto's volatility won't lead to margin calling of big banks or hedge funds because of point #2.  If a smaller hedge fund gets margin called then we would see something like the Archegos situation but the market has already recovered almost entirely from that. The larger institutions are the ones that could cause a crash and since they wont have all of their portfolio in crypto, they won't get margin called.

&#x200B;

4.) The fed said it wasn't going to look at changing the monetary policy until around 2022 or 2023, maybe even later. One can argue the poor effects that this could have on inflation and other things but the market can basically count on ""easy money"" policies for a long time.

Source global news wire:
Nokia’s Nuage Networks Virtualized Cloud Services (VCS) solution will provide advanced network automation across networks and clouds of all sizes — allowing customers to build fully isolated and secure virtual private clouds (VPCs) that connect to other VPCs, the internet and enterprise data centers.

Nokia has worked closely with China Mobile Cloud since 2015 — with both China Mobile Cloud’s public and private cloud services running on Nuage’s SDN solution — continuously developing features and improving system architecture for the growing demand of cloud service.

Nokia’s Nuage Networks VCS can support a massive number of virtual machines (VM) and bare metal services (BM) in the same network with full policy control. The flexible architecture also allows direct connectivity between the end points without going through gateways, which can quickly become bottlenecks in a cloud environment.

Markus Bochert, President of Nokia Greater China, said: “As China Mobile Cloud’s strategic partner, we’re very honored to be part of China Mobile Cloud’s public cloud deployment. With Nokia’s Nuage SDN portfolio and our customized service, we’re confident to support China Mobile Cloud to pursue its goal in the cloud era.”

Sunil Khandekar, CEO of Nokia’s Nuage Networks, said: “Contributing to this service for the region presents immense opportunity for Nokia with the rapid growth of China Mobile Cloud. We developed the network solution together with customers to ensure it was suitable for China Mobile Cloud’s expansion of its public cloud application. By deploying our SDN solution, China Mobile Cloud’s customers will have the ability to create highly secure and dynamic virtual networks.”

Nokia’s Nuage Networks Virtualized Cloud Services (VCS) solution includes an SDN controller, software switch, SDN gateway, firewall, load balancer and VPN, and will provide:

Inter-virtual private cloud (VPC) connectivity in different data centers for fault tolerance and to locate applications closer to the end users

Data Center Interconnection (DCI) that is fully automated by the Nuage platform

Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) to secure the critical cloud workloads

Bare Metal as a Service (BMaaS) for non-virtualized workloads and workloads needing access to physical hardware



From market watch I believe?
Nokia’s technology and strategy chief Nishant Batra said the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a fast-paced evolution toward digitalization, with evolutions in cloud and wireless access as two key enablers.


“We were all going toward a digital society at a rapid pace, but this is exponentially gaining traction now,” said Batra, chief strategy and technology officer at Nokia, during a virtual media round table Tuesday.

He pointed to a 30% increase in overall network traffic in the U.S., businesses shifting work from home policies, and behavioral changes with digital tools in focus and enabled by 5G.

The take up of 5G technology has been one of the fastest compared to earlier generations, and is expected to sustain, Batra noted. For example, he said almost 150,000 sites are being deployed between North and Latin America, with 13 operator 5G rollouts in the regions, and a shift toward standalone 5G.  In the U.S., it’s expected four out of five people will be covered by 5G by year’s end.

In addition to take up of 5G wireless access, as well as early-stage research on 6G for consumer and enterprise use, the other critical enabler from Nokia’s standpoint is the cloud and relates to the role of the edge for enterprise.

Batra expects to see “a very exciting value chain come up,” citing opportunities for workloads, security, infrastructure and real estate – all to get the enterprise connected.

RELATED: Nokia’s mobile network head ready to face open RAN competition

“I firmly believe this decade will be about really putting the cloud out there in the far edge and possibly the micro edge to enable the cyber-physical landscape coming together,” he said. “It is also important that not just we as suppliers, but the entire industry is coming to the realization that the future is in software.”  

It's also about ensuring that software can deployed in a fast-paced way, focused on the use cases enterprises care about, he added. Part of this involves Network as a Service (NaaS), and a future shift Batra pegged in the next 5 to 7 years, from thinking about the network as delivering service level agreements (SLAs) to providing business outcomes.

Operators are currently building out coverage and capacity with 5G networks, but ahead Batra sees critical networks, hyper local private networks for enterprise and industrial adoption. Those won’t take off until software agility is developed, alongside adoption of as-a-service business models, he said during prepared remarks at Nokia’s virtual event on digitalization in the Americas.

Batra also pointed to continued changes in network architecture.

“As 5G evolves towards 6G, disaggregated networks will become the norm, not an exception and we need to be prepared for that.”

RELATED: 6G doesn’t mean ditching 5G but ‘evolving’ to next G

Three-fourths of enterprise traffic by 2025 will happen on the edge, he said, citing a Gartner study, with compute moving closer to the use case at the edge, far edge and micro edge. Major cloud webscalers have joined the party and use cases will need to flow end-to-end, which is where Batra said network slicing comes into play.

Network slicing business models

Batra called network slicing “a fundamental requirement” for monetizing the network.

He firmly believes it will start as a capability-driven business model – where slices are segmented and represented to potential buyers based on capabilities applicable for their use cases, be it security or SLAs – but very soon evolve to as-a-service.

“As a service model, it will then become network slice-as-a-service, essentially.”

That business model can then go further, he said, with network slice-as-a-service complemented with exposure to cloud webscalers-as-a-service APIs (with NaaS from operators) to build what Batra said will be outcome-as-a-service, where applications and developers have come to utilize the full marketplace.

RELATED: Nokia partners with AWS, Microsoft, Google for 5G and cloud

“For a developer to use the capabilities of the network, then they will have to think about network-as-a-service exposure of the telecoms, and then they would complement that with webscale, possibly a far edge in the enterprise,” Batra said. “That’s how I believe these use cases will really take off.”

Before any of that gets going though, there needs to be a focus on orchestration for the network slices themselves. Network slicing may present new business models, but operators and suppliers are still working to establish the technology, though Batra said community is coming around and getting there.

“These slices have to be dynamically cleared and destroyed as needed,” he noted. “So the orchestration [engine] is a key technology for the marketplace to exist.”

When will business models for network slicing come into play?

“I believe this will become real in about six to 18 months,” Batra said.

RELATED: Dish looks to serve up secure 5G slicing with Nokia software

Nokia just expanded its work with Dish, providing security software for end-to-end network slicing – with automation and orchestration a key component. It has also inked 5G and cloud partnerships with AWS, Google, and Microsoft.

Private networks are another major focus for Nokia, which promise their own levels of security and reliability for enterprise customers. The Finnish vendor works both through service provider partners as well as direct to enterprise for private networks.

This month Verizon secured its first European private 5G network customer in a deal with Associated British Ports (ABP) that involves Nokia. The operator launched its private 5G managed service for international customers leveraging Nokia’s Digital Automation Cloud application platform, which also offers local edge computing.

RELATED: Will private wireless kill network slicing before it even gets started?

When it comes to Nokia’s focus on private networks versus CSP interest in network slicing, Batra doesn’t view them as in conflict.

“I see both going together for us, not just one,” he said, noting Nokia’s strong enterprise connections and portfolio, as well as operator’s systems integration expertise in some cases.","['AMZN', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'DISH']"

1. Company Insiders are selling. 

True 

Yup, they are. And they will continue for the rest of this company's life. They will also eventually buy some as well. It gets scheduled quarterly. It's how companies work. Even Apple. Even Telsa. 

But, something you need to understand was this has been planned since the beginning of February. Its common. 

Here is that form from Feburary... 

https://investors.zomedica.com/node/8536/html 

Here is the website to look at all the Form 4's from today. Note the bottom green wording about Rule 10b5. 

https://investors.zomedica.com/sec-filings 

Here is that rule.. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp 

To conclude, this was just coincidence that they planned to sell their shares while we are in the middle of pretty ruthless selloff . They planned this months ago. I'm sure they were hoping for more but weren't we all. If they really were scammy, I'm sure Cohen could have put out some PR right before today to jump the price of his employees, but they didn't. 

2. Cartridges were sold out? 

Maybe. 

We can't confirm as to why they were off the Miller website yesterday. But, as of this afternoon, they are back. Would be very Bullish if they sold out though. Although maybe someone can confirm, wasn't there 5 of them? Now I only see 3 back so far. 

https://millervet.shop/catalogsearch/result/?q=Truforma+


3. Institutions are selling. 

False. 

Don't get me wrong, Institutions buy and sell all the time but from the discrepancy from the Fintel and Nasdaq, it seems like institutional buying is increasing especially at these prices. Somewhat hard to tell though because they only are required to report quarterly. 

https://fintel.io/so/us/zom 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/zom/institutional-holdings


4. A reverse split is imminent. 

False. 

A bear favorite. It would need to get approved by shareholders, and for which it has been voted against twice. However, a share buyback was approved and will likely happen at some point. The details are not completely clear as to when, but the cheaper the share the more likely the buyback. 



At the end of the day, this period can suck. That said, everyone was begging for these prices again a month ago. Well here we are. Don't get twisted, no one knows where this is headed, it clearly seems manipulated by something stronger than retail buyers. Dropping 5-10% and barcoding for the rest of the day is not normal stock behavior. Because of that, I dont really think this has a floor anywhere in particular. It will be whenever the shorts change their narrative. 


This isn't some post to convince you to buy Zom. I just think there is alot of negative sentiment and misleading information out there. For now, make your own decisions about Zomedica. Nothing about this company has changed other than they are guaranteed revenue for the first time.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

mribxl,,wallstreetbets,post,1618504157,"GME: For all you new people, and even many of you veterans, let me explain how you win this fight.I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

I have a significant position in GME.  I bought in around $100, have been constantly buying more over time, and have held from $350 to today's price (currently $156).  I will continue to buy/hold.  I'm not here to give you a floor, but I can sure as hell guarantee you that I'm not selling my shares anywhere near 1k.

I won't lie to y'all, I originally bought in solely for the squeeze potential, but that's not why I'm here anymore.  We don't know if the squeeze will squooze, but what we do know is that we will profit handsomely if we're patient.  Let's go over a few things:

**(1) No one knows the short interest (SI).  There are zero reliable sources for SI data.  Everything that you see is entirely speculation.  Therefore, no one knows if shorts have covered or fucking quintupled down or worse.**

**(2) If we are truly a part of one of the most heinous financial conspiracies that the world has even seen, I guarantee you the MOASS will NOT occur until the proper safeguards are in place, i.e. NSCC/DTCC/OCC regulations.  If the market can be manipulated to fuck retail, it can be manipulated to delay a MOASS until certain measures are in place.  These regulations may not be fully approved for 2-3 months.**

**(3) Gamestop, led by Ryan Cohen, is beginning a fundamental transformation.   They paid off their debt.  They're replacing nearly all of their top level execs.  They're forming an e-commerce company with people who were part of building some of the most successful e-commerce companies in existence. If/when this transformation is successful, it could result in GME's price reaching more than $1000 in the next 1-3 years or so.  This is completely independent of any squeeze.**

*I believe that illegal market manipulation is taking place, there's a ridiculous amount of short interest, the MOASS will eventually occur, and on top of that the Gamestop transformation will be wildly successful.  I don't know when the MOASS could happen.  I can't possibly estimate a floor since I don't know the real short interest.  What I do know is that this is the best investment opportunity that I've ever seen and here's the best way to think about this play:*

&#x200B;

1. If you believe in the transformation thesis, this should be the easiest investment play of your life.  Some of us bought in a $4, $40, or even $400.  Let's assume most people's average share price is $200.  So if the price were to get to $1000, then you've made 5x your initial investment.  That's fucking insane.  You can't go anywhere in the world and find a (legal and cheap buy in) investment opportunity that has a pretty damn good chance of giving you a 5x return and all you have to do is wait a few years.
2. If the MOASS occurs, and the majority of people believe in (1), then one would assume that those people will hold to far beyond low $XXXX.  Why wouldn't you?  You believe that the price is going to get near there relatively soon anyway.  Again, I'm not here to set a floor, but if GME squeezes, I will say that I won't sell below $XXXXX, and I'd hope that even the most paper handed of apes wouldn't either.

So to reiterate: even if there is no squeeze, even if all the shorts have covered, even if some demonic intervention takes place and fucks over retail letting the shorters escape, if you hold, there's a very good chance that you're going to get make a ridiculous return.  I'd love to be a part of this transformation, and I'm more than happy to wait for my tendies.

mre3bi,,wallstreetbets,post,1618491419,"AMC filed with the SEC its promise not to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized in 2021 - but what does this really mean?TLDR at the bottom. 

The CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC that AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by shareholders in May. 

Happy to report that as of this morning AMC filed [Statement 14A](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e5d2e721-c60b-4f74-9f90-7e970a8fc426.html) reiterating exactly what AA said in the interview: 

 
>**Adam Aron**: We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can’t announce intentions and then not carry through it, we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.
 
>. . .
 
>**Adam Aron**: If we need to raise some cash in the short term, remember we already have 43 million shares that are out there that were authorized in the year 2013 that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.

This is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise. 

But, the emphasis is on cautious. First rule of sound investing - read the fine print. That’s how they screw you. 


>Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or facts [listed above] materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained herein. **Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.** Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.

Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen  they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can’t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don’t want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares. 

**STAY DILIGENT AND DO WHATS BEST FOR YOUR WALLET**

Seen many people switch to an automatic “yes” on their vote. I won’t be one of those people. 

I’m not an advisor or your advisor, financial or otherwise. I’m just a guy with thousands of AMC shares who likes to read the fine print and make weighted decisions based on facts. 

Full disclosure - I sold a third of my April 2019 shares in January to recoup basis and take profits. The rest is in for the ride as it’s all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible.

TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise. Bad news they can still issue more shares if the situation gets worse this year. My “no” vote stands.",

For nearly 20 years my wife and I have been investing passively (first in mutual funds then in index funds). After the GME thing our family became more interested in active investing (with just a small amount of money that we don’t mind losing, sorry no YOLO here but maybe loss/gain porn someday). 

Anyways, the impact you have had is we now have 5 active traders in our household ages 5 to 45 (exact ages withheld for privacy).

The kids are all interested in investing. One has done really well +20%, another +10% and another -10% not bad for total beginners and 8 weeks of action. They use small money and understand that they can lose money and gain money. I’m ok with whatever their individual outcome is as I feel their cumulative experience and conversations with each other and my wife and I will help them to build a better understanding of financial topics than they would get otherwise.

I have to believe I am not the only parent that is thrilled to see their kids interested in markets and learning lessons that are cheap now but will serve them well for the rest of their lives. I wish I had this type of opportunity when I was a kid as it would have limited more expensive mistakes in my 20s and probably left me with better finances today (longer time in the market and more experience). 

With that said thanks to all you apes and may the odds be ever in your favor!",

mr6hl9,,wallstreetbets,post,1618456654,"""Victory Has Defeated You"" - A quote to remember and live by...A long time ago, back in 2013, I started out with a very small sum on money and subsequently hit the jackpot with my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th option trade. Hitting those consecutive wins really jacked me up (cash-wise and ego-wise). I was just out of college and really began to think I had everything all figured out. Well, as it turned out, I really didn't. I started to lose everything I had gained and clearly I was 'the' fool in the equation.

At around that time one of my favorite movies was The Dark Knight Rises. I would watch it alllll the time when it was on TV. And one day, on a bad-bad-bad market day, I was watching the movie and arrived at this scene:

you(remove-me)tube.com/watch?v=mdM46G984vw

I had an epiphany when I heard the line...I had let victory defeat me. I let those wins cloud my judgement and it made me think I was more than I was. The lucky series of events got to my head and it was clear that I had fallen into this trap of weakness-by-winning.

Over the years I never really forget that phrase. I started to live that phrase in the market - never letting my guard down during the best of times, never letting myself feel like I won...no matter how high the portfolio went. And over time I was able to correct those mistakes I made by ending my option addiction and simply buying stock (cough Tesla cough). And through all the ups and downs over the years, I always kept that phrase in my mind. For awhile it was even my alarm message, so that every morning when the market opened, I ALWAYS remembered how foolish I was in the past.

Ultimately keeping my guard up and never declaring victory led me to the promised land. I now have more cash than I'll ever need. But never again did I let victory defeat me. And eventually not only had I surpassed every financial goal I had set out to achieve, I did it in 7 years instead of 17 years...way earlier than I expected. And now, in a weird way, victory can never defeat me - because I'm not even sitting at the table. Yes I still own stock, a lot of stock, but there's no expiration date and my life no longer revolves around the drama of the day.

Many folks will tell you to ""extend your goals"". Yeah no...that doesn't apply to everything. Sometimes enough money is enough money. Sure, $2 million would be nice...and maybe I'll hit that mark someday soon...but you don't risk everything for more. The first $500k is life-changing, the 2nd $500k not-so-much...so don't risk life-changing money if you have it. There's no harm in hitting 10 home-runs in a row sometimes...you don't need an 11th. And if you keep chasing that dragon, sometimes the dragon chases you back.

And so I leave you all with the quote - Victory Has Defeated You - live it, love it, learn it. Don't let your guard down. Remember, Wall Street is no one friend...if you want a friend on Wall Street, get a dog. And remember to never let your wins make you a loser.

Have a good night :)

P.S. - I'm not Bane.","['TSLA', 'UPS']"

mqvqjb,gujd4ts,wallstreetbets,comment,1618437229,"Since 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission has required brokerage firms to file a quarterly report showing where they are routing their stock trades for execution. The filing is known as a 606 report after Rule 606 of Regulation NMS (National Market System). Because so many traders at Reddit’s WallStreetBets’ message board have focused on the fact that billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was executing the majority of trades for Robinhood, the trading app where a lot of the Redditors directed their GameStop trades, we decided to take a look at what other online brokers might have also been directing GameStop trades to Citadel Securities.

According to the 606 reports for the fourth quarter of 2020 for the following nine online brokers, Citadel was providing payment-for-order-flow (giving a cash rebate for trade orders directed to it) to each of the following: Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Ally Invest Securities, First Trade and TradeStation. At Fidelity Brokerage Services, it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment-for-order-flow on the option orders, according to its 606 report.

According to these 606 reports, Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities. Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E-Trade while ranking lower for stock trades. At First Trade and TradeStation, Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks (trades with no stated price limit) and number one for options.

The bottom line here: there was a high probability that no matter what online brokerage firm Redditors sent their GameStop orders to initially, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was getting a piece of the action in the end. According to the website of Citadel Securities, “To maximize trading opportunities for clients, our automated trading platform sources liquidity from all U.S. exchanges and more than 18 alternative liquidity venues.”

That last sentence is what investigators want to look at. That is, what is the final destination of all of these Citadel Securities trades. “Alternative liquidity venues” may include Dark Pools which are in desperate need of some sunshine. (See GameStop Shares: Dark Pools Owned by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, UBS, et al, Have Made Tens of Thousands of Trades.)

Pay to play in the trading world has worked out very well for Griffin. According to Forbes, as of today, Griffin’s net worth is $15 billion. Forbes reported Griffin’s wealth at just $7.6 billion less than five years ago.

All that dough sloshing around in Griffin’s bank accounts has found some interesting destinations. Just ask U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Citadel paid Yellen $992,500 for speaking gigs since she stepped down as Fed Chair in February of 2018. Two of those events, on October 17, 2019 and December 3, 2019, commanded $292,500 each. Then, at the height of the pandemic in October 2020, Citadel paid Yellen $337,500 in total to speak at unspecified events on October 9; October 20; October 26; and October 27. Yellen’s disclosure form also lists a liability to Citadel of “$50,001 to $100,000,” owed as a refund for a cancelled event. Why she hasn’t paid that back yet is curious. [See updated information at end of this article.]

All of this comes from the jaw-dropping financial disclosure form that Yellen filed with the (try to contain your laughter) Office of Government Ethics in advance of her Senate Finance Committee Confirmation Hearing to become the U.S. Treasury Secretary.

Yellen’s cash haul for speaking gigs in 2019 and 2020 came to more than $7 million, with most of that coming from Wall Street firms and hedge funds. Yellen did not disclose her speaking fees in 2018.

Yellen is now rumored to be hauling together the SEC, the Fed, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission this week to look into the trading in GameStop. In a rational world, Yellen would have to recuse herself from any matter involving Citadel. But when it comes to matters involving Wall Street, we left that rational world in 1999 with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which allowed giant federally-insured banks to merge with Wall Street’s casino trading firms for the first time since 1933. It’s been downhill ever since.",['SCHW']

mrhzgr,,wallstreetbets,post,1618503183,"Rocket Companies (RKT) Due Diligence**TLDR:** RKT appears to be fairly valued based off a fundamental analysis and a strong bull case could be made if they can continue to take market share in the loan origination market even with rates increasing and refinancing decreasing. My biggest concern is Dan Gilbert controls 99% of the vote, you are really buying Dan Gilbert's ability to continue to grow this company, which he has done well recently. 

**Disclaimer:** I own 0 shares of RKT, just enjoy doing valuations on companies and found the loan origination market very interesting. This is not investing advice, just my thoughts. 

You can download my model here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/17GQA6qSLKfPrkgfKmvNR55oo3ddbnegT/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17GQA6qSLKfPrkgfKmvNR55oo3ddbnegT/view?usp=sharing)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a disclaimer I tend to give more conservative valuations when looking at companies, but was surprised by Rocket Companies. 

Anyways, my analysis below of the stock:

I've made an attempt at projecting each of their lines of revenue in my DCF, I will cover each of these one by one:

**Loan Production Data (Gain on Sale of Loans):**

* I've made the assumption that refinancing will drop by 50% in 2021 and continue to decline back to 2018 levels in total volume by 2030.
* I've made the assumption that New Purchase volume will grow pretty slowly at around 5%
* The market share that Rocket Companies will control I've held constant at 2020 level
* The last big assumption here is that their margin on loan originations will be around 3.7% which is an average of their previous 3 years
* All of this has their Sale of Loan Revenue going from $15Bn in 2020 to $9.4Bn in 2030

https://preview.redd.it/w8ub9ubi2dt61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6da42da69dc0499f22254df1197eecb4db7156

**Servicing Portfolio Data (Servicing Portfolio Revenue)**

* Assumed their loan servicing portfolio will grow at the same rate as new loan originations
* Assumed average loan size will grow 5% which seemed to be a relatively safe assumption based off annual increase in housing prices (Thinking now this might be a bit high as old loans in the portfolio won't be growing, so this would be a bit lower, but is not super material to the overall valuation)
* Servicing fee will stay flat at roughly .3%, this is conservative, if rates go up this will increase as there will be more room for them to take a cut
* Net client retention rate is held flat at 91%, this could really go either way
* All of this has their Servicing Portfolio Revenue going from $1.1Bn in 2020 to $2.9Bn in 2030

https://preview.redd.it/myvch5jk2dt61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a89d1d764a252126f12119d2689f15fd014182d

**Change in Fair Value of MSRs**

* This is the one part I don't fully understand and am not confident in
* I've assumed they will return to 2018 levels and held constant
* This has revenue going from a ($2.3bn) loss in 2020 to a ($0.2bn) loss in 2030
* My understanding is this is mark to market of their servicing portfolio and an update estimate of future cash flows and is not an actual impact to cash flow. It's value is based off pre-payment speed mostly which is mostly tied to interest rates. Pre-payment speeds drop has rates increase which is good for this portfolio, and vice versa
* Also my understanding is that when rates increase the loss is less and when rates drop losses increase, hence why I have it losing less going forward. I believe rates will slowly rise over the next decade.

**Other Income**

* AmRock Title Insurance is the main driver here and I've tied it to loans originated and held that rate constant
* Revenue goes from $1.8bn in 2020 to $1.2bn in 2030

https://preview.redd.it/4t5fo3lp2dt61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3485c6f0d57b3c8e4e09f98674cc4c040f2b47

**Total Revenue**

* All of these projections have revenue going from $15.6Bn in 2020 to $13.3bn in 2030
* You can see I don't have them sustaining their current revenue levels for the next decade, yet my DCF still gets us a fairly valued company in the range of $37-49bn when you sensitive for WACC and Terminal Growth

mrfyuh,,wallstreetbets,post,1618497335,"AMC DiscussionRecently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:

1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down
2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.
3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.

Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.

P.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.

Edit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things:

1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now.
2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger  and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff)
3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal. (unlike at the start where is was just total confusion.)",['SPGI']

mrjo7k,,wallstreetbets,post,1618507957,"I switched from a short term bull strategy to a long term diversified portfolio.Now instead of seeing my money go away overnight I get to watch it slowing slip away over months.

I don't know if anyone will get anything from this story or if really I just needed one place to put everything I thought I was learning. I'm not that old yet, but over the years I've gone through a lot of different understandings/strategy when it comes to investment. I always knew the way to get ahead was to make money on having money but I've never known how (spoiler alert: I still don't). First I tried listening to respectable sources, I thought if someone educated wrote an article recommending one stock or industry that chances are it would go up. This of course was short sighted, humans are weird and do not always say something just for the befit of others.  


With it all too obvious that investment advice from established sources could not just be taken at face value, I had to start drawing my own conclusions. I started trying to research companies and technologies directly to understand both where the industries are and what is possible with our level of technology in various fields. I also have a little experience with business so I tried to evaluate business models, although I'll admit some of these publicly traded companies make money in a lot of different ways that is hard for me to wrap my head completely around. This strategy I think can work but what I came to understand is how much speculation is really in a stock compared to it's value. I know this is kind of ""duh"" looking back but for a young person it seems all to logical a stock would reflect the value of the company. What this massive amount of speculation did for a stock was to immediately calculate any verifiable speculation into the stock (plus a little). This essentially meant my strategy of trying to know enough about a stock was invalid because as soon as I was ever sure of something about a company it was already priced into the stock months or even years before it would even happen. Take PLUG or SPCE for instance, each had a huge spike in the last few years and neither are profitable. They each provide almost just a hope for these worlds full of clean hydrogen and space tourism while discounting the struggle these companies will have to go through to bring about this. Essentially they are just marketing companies for a different way the world could be, the reality would have to be a massive ecosystem.  


Throughout those failures I noticed one thing seemed to hold true for myself, stock of a solid company will eventually go up. The problem I saw was that I kept getting out of my positions after my short term assumptions seemed false. This is when I decided it would be a good plan to pick a list of a few companies I felt were solid, I looked at the amount of employees vs market cap to try and pick companies that were actually doing something. Then for a while I would sell a little if any of them went up a decent amount and buy a little if any of them when down, but always keeping the majority in. As an algorithm, the idea has merit. If the stock market is just a random curve then you should be able to come up with a simple strategy of buying and selling to have an average curve up. The problem then comes that I am not extraordinarily wealthy. The stocks would just keep going down sometimes and I just didn't have money at the bottom to keep buying. I guess this is a failure in planning by not having enough cash to keep buying but to make the math work then I would have had to invest so little that the whole strategy would net me a latte.

&#x200B;

Now here I am again, with plenty of failures to learn from and only a few fleeting successes that are hard to attribute to much of anything but luck. I seem so sometimes have a brainwave, when I'm not even thinking about stocks, about some obvious trend that was about to happen. When I act on that, I can sometimes do alright (assuming I have the money at the time to invest). For instance it was an obvious trend in February that if Biden won the election in America than green energy stocks would go up as the us would re-enter the Paris Agreement. Granted I'm not a financial advisor and you should not take financial advice from me.  


At this point the best thing for me to do is to take a step back from all of it, cash in, and spend some time just thinking more. I feel horrible though since that means liquidating my long term positions that I kept buying more into and kept losing more and more of. I guess maybe that is why I'm writing this, to give some value to my money lost. To hopefully through this process learn the next thing I should know. I'm not looking for advice, sympathy or praise, but if anyone has a similar experience I would love to hear it. If there is anything I've learned from this subreddit it is that something even more valuable than money is the wisdom and understanding needed to make it.",

I tried posting this new discussion on both WSB and WSBOG right after market open, but it seems that my account has some issue with posting new threads -- none of my posts ever go through without mod approval, despite being added as a [contributor to the sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7l0p0/gme_disinfo_exposed_1_why_the_gme_moass_post_that/grburu2/).

Anyway, this time I'm posting about why you should be **wary** about short-term hype surrounding HYLN. I know that may shock you after yesterday's post, but read on -- you'll probably feel like I'm preaching to the choir, here.

# ...What?

Let me start by saying that I believe in the potential of this company -- its *long-term potential*. This isn't a short squeeze, this isn't a quick turn around, this isn't a few dollars you throw at some FDs. This is a stock with a **real** chance of going gangbusters in the next few years.

I've noticed [posts celebrating](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrdeqb/hyliion_moon_time/) HYLN's premarket rise. HYLN is *often* green premarket and then descends into the fiery red depths of hell slightly after 9:30am. This is a common market manipulation technique: it's ***easy*** and ***cheap*** to buy stocks up during premarket/after hours because the float is so low, so it doesn't take much to push a stock up. Then, once the stock starts off high, and retail FOMO in, that's when the big boys dump the bags on you. **Premarket and AH mean jack shit.**

So why am I warning you? Because I've noticed some really suspicious activity since posting yesterday. I feel I owe it to you to let you know what I've noticed. Also, my parents raised me to be incredibly honest. Not gonna lie, it's a bit of a drawback sometimes, but like George ""Motherfucking"" Washington, I cannot tell a lie.

Also, this isn't entirely selfless -- paper hands sink stocks. I want you guys to know what you're getting into. I want you to know what we're up against. I want you to know why it's important to be in it for the long haul (haha trucking joke, get it?)

First, let's talk about APU.

# High APU Rating

This is something I wrote about in a previous post about [GME disinformation](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbh9xe/disinfo_exposed_2_how_hedge_funds_and_useful_apes/) that wasn't permitted on WSB: the APU ratio (Awards Per Upvote ratio).

I ran some numbers for the typical amount of awards for every upvote for randomly-selected posts from different categories of posts:

* Posts by DFV
* Pro-GME posts (during the period when it topped out the second time -- 1 month ago)
* Pro-silver posts
* Pre-GME DD posts

[You can see the results here.](https://i.postimg.cc/8zqqPrHx/Awards-Per-Upvote.png) I chose these categories, because I figured DFV's posts were a decent representation of organic posting in WSB -- they're easy to digest and impressive enough to merit awards. They're probably on the higher end of what an authentic post could expect to receive in terms of awards on WSB. When compared to pre-GME DD posts, you'll see that my theory stands correct: DFV's have an APU ratio almost 10x higher than pre-GME DD posts. DFV's post had an average APU of 0.0323.

I also looked at pro-silver posts, because there was a consensus that silver sentiment was being manipulated in WSB. It's no coincidence that silver died immediately the day after after media started pushing a misleading narrative that ""Silver had become the next GME"" ([Source](https://i.ibb.co/8bpLNv0/slvscam.png)). I noticed that silver posting had an APU higher than DFV's posts. The most upvoted pro-silver post had an APU **more than 3x DFV's average APU, and much higher than even his highest APU ratio.** Pro-GME posts were similarly high.

I ran some numbers on my own post yesterday, after someone raised this same suspicion.

The APU for [my post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqrfzf/hyln_how_we_got_here_where_were_going_aka_the_moon/) was abnormally high. It's 0.0664, which is...:

* twice that of DFV's average
* higher than a random selection of 10/11 of DFV's higher-upvoted posts
* almost twice that of pro-GME posts (during a time of what I believe was ongoing astroturfing and positive sentiment manipulation)
* much higher than that of silver (though admittedly I used a small sample size)
* over 10x that of pre-GME WSB

Now, it's important to qualify this: taken alone, this data could just be merely coincidental. There's a lot that can explain it: gracious HYLN owners finally seeing their stock get its dues, random weirdness, etc. Taken alone, this data might not mean much. So let's contextualize it.

Let's look at...

# Suspicious social media activity

The [exact same user](https://i.ibb.co/KGRGKjt/censored.png) kept rewarding my post -- 9 awards over 7 hours. How often would you stick around 7 hours to award the exact same post?

Okay, not enough to be conclusive, but...

[Look at his account page](https://i.ibb.co/mTDBWYp/shillbot.png). Lots of warning flags:

* Extremely low karma
* Posts exclusively in WSB
* Has an award for gilding so many goddamn people
* Formed Jan 27th (which corresponds to a lot of pro-hedgie activity, based on my observations)

Okay, now in context the picture is starting to become a bit more clear...

Here's [one even better](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png) \-- this is what these guys like to do. They give a stock pick, give an extremely specific date. ""BUY TOMORROW IT'S GONNA EXPLODE"" and then the next two days the stock craters 10%.

I feel a bit like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat when I say shit like this, but do you think I'm making this up? [Think again](https://i.ibb.co/56LJp04/shortbot.png). If you (weak, puny, individual investor) buy, it's easier for them (hedge funds, billionaires, shorters, shitillionaires) to sell into your buys. They get a better price to short at, *and* they get to shake your paper hands.

In all honesty, I made some pretty good money finding these shills and inversing them. Even still, I tried to warn about them before, but my post was censored. This level of disgusting control and manipulation just does NOT sit right with me. If this thread is what helps expose this manipulative bullshit, I don't really care that it sacrifices a money-making strategy that I've used to 100% success up until now. Fuck hedge funds, basically. Fuck billionaires trying to shake a few cents from the little guy.

For the record, any time a poster whose name starts with ""**Ad**Something####"" (for, y'know, ***advertisement***) starts getting bullish on a stock, that  freaks me the fuck out. Especially if they only have a 2 month old account. Look around with a critical eye and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Oh, and remember yesterday in my posts when I talked about an account on Stocktwits that shitposts about HYLN literally all day every day? Well, [he's back](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty7200), and I can confirm that, based on his posting style and patterns, that's definitely him. Curious he came back the exact same day I made the HYLN bullish post, no?

**tl;dr:**

**HYLN is still being manipulated. Wouldn't be surprised if it continues trending down for the short-term as it shakes out weak paper hands. Think about why. I'm holding this stock until something FUNDAMENTAL changes about the company. Day-to-day red and green doesn't change my thesis. Paper hands get shook.**",

mrhlsn,gumf5uw,wallstreetbets,comment,1618505108,"No need to compare to GME or assume there will be a short squeeze. The fact is, the new release from 2 weeks ago, directly contradicts a large chunk of what is asserted in the short report. I have little reason to think both VW and QS lied about testing the battery in the lab in Germany (two weeks before the short report and the short report does not address that at all!) so I have to conclude the short report is clearly misinformed. 

I suspect, Scorpion Capital, probably spent a lot of time putting this together and they realized two weeks ago that it would all fall apart due to the news release, so they rushed to finish the short report in the hope they can drop the price and cash out on their work.",

This will close several loopholes that market makers and HF have over retail investors for all trades routed to IEX.

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf)

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange’s Retail Price Improvement Program for the **benefit of retail investors.** Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.190(b)(15) to **apply only to the trading interest of a natural person that does not place more than 390 equity orders per day** on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s);7 (ii) **provide Order Book8 priority to Retail Liquidity Provider (“RLP”) orders9 at the Midpoint Price10 ahead of other non-displayed orders priced to execute at the Midpoint Price;** (iii) disseminate a “Retail Liquidity Identifier” through the Exchange’s proprietary market data feeds and the appropriate securities information processor (“SIP”) when RLP order interest aggregated to form at least one round lot for a particular security is available in the System,11 provided that the RLP order interest is resting at the Midpoint Price and is **priced at least $0.001 better than the NBB12 or NBO13**; and (iv) amend the definition of RLP orders so **such orders can only be midpoint peg orders**,14 cannot be Discretionary Peg orders,15 and cannot include a minimum quantity restriction.16 The proposed changes are designed to further support and enhance the ability of non-professional retail investors to obtain meaningful price improvement by incentivizing market participants to compete to provide such price improvement.

Retail Liquidity Provider means a broker that routes retail orders through the IEX. You can call your broker and see if they are an RLP for IEX.

Read some of the DD to learn a bit on how **non displayed orders** are likely being used by citadel and friends to manipulate the price.

Overall, it seems like a major step in the right direction to help level the playing field. It looks like it has to go through the traditional comment period before approval. (Not an advance notice).

TL;DR: This completely negates the ability for other firms to see retail orders before execution and then act accordingly to manipulate the price. This would give retail orders **Priority over other non-displayed orders. It would also force the broker to enter the trade at the midpoint price (Ie between ask and bid). Previously, this could be manipulated to decrease the price by consistently filling orders at lower and lower prices so that even though people are buying, the price drops.**

Still reading will add more as needed.

Edit: moved some things around and added TL;DR","['PEG', 'IEX']"

mr1za6,,wallstreetbets,post,1618440361,"$COIN: $150B ($570/share) Price TargetTLDR:

* $COIN collects revenue on trading USD VOLUME not asset prices. More trading, buying, *and* selling = more revenue
* Each cycle has introduced a new volume range
* Paypal's and Square's (and Affirm's) valuation indicate the markets are willing to price fintech at large multiples

We can readily compare $COIN against Paypal and Square: they all offer peer-to-peer payment solutions, are involved in the currency space, and offer exchange services. While, PYPL and SQ both offer more established merchant solutions that's not to discredit $COIN's efforts in enabling businesses to accept currency via its 'commerce' service, which could become popular as opinions and usage continue to increase favorably.

$COIN's [Q1 Numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/coinbase-reports-estimated-q1-revenue-of-1point8-billion-up-nine-fold.html)

* $1.8 Billion Revenue
* $800 Million Profit
* 56 Million users

Using these numbers, we can approximate the annual numbers:

* $7.2 Billion Annual Revenue
* $3.2 Billion Annual Profit

**This is making 2 quite large assumptions:**

1. Quarterly revenue is not seasonal -- revenues from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 are approximately equivalent
2. Revenue is *sustained* \-- revenue is not dependent on asset prices, but rather trading volume. More on this later

^(2) While a 20.8 PS ratio may seem rich, this would be within reason of Affirm's [25.7 PS Ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/AFRM/ps_ratio)

# ^ Assuming that revenue streams are sustainable and continue to grow, there's no reason why $COIN can't trade at $150B, when compared to Paypal and Square multiples

# 

# Argument for Sustained Revenue

* **$COIN** collects fees on buying *and* selling. If the assets were to suddenly correct, $COIN will still collect fees on the sell side. **We can make a strong claim that $COIN's revenues are primarily dependent on volume, not asset prices**

That means that even when the share price was higher than US$41.53 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.

mr49vv,,wallstreetbets,post,1618448405,"$GME -- comparison of the gains/losses within the open market and after-hoursI was looking at the [history of $GME prices,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history) and I noticed that most of the gains in price were made in after hours trading, and most of the losses occurred while the market was open.  Often, when there was a gain in the market, then after hours trading would jump on and even bigger gains would be seen.  When the price went down, it generally happened much more in the market than in after hours.  Lately, however, after-hours trading has been less prominent to achieving gains.

Here are three graphs from the numbers at the aforementioned [site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history):

&#x200B;

[Day's Close minus the Day's Open](https://preview.redd.it/fk467ji6v7t61.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=f81f5fdc69c08d8b8d249fef23efcc57f2db9004)

&#x200B;

[Gains from after hours](https://preview.redd.it/sel54mr6w7t61.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a62dc8bc75076ff9379ab6b642fb3acc9b12173)

&#x200B;

[combined gains graph](https://preview.redd.it/0wmxphkcw7t61.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b8274b3fddd8bef7533b4b2bde9951adb8b743d)

This last graph is the first two combined.  Notice that the after-hours trading provided most of the price gain in the first spike and second spike (Jan 26 and Feb 24).  It's interesting to note that the third spike on March 25 was mostly the open market, but it was not echoed by after hours trading as the previous two had been.

On 22-Jan-2021, the volume reached its highest level so far.  The market opened at $42.59, and closed at $65.01, meaning there was a 22.42 gain.  After hours trading increased it another 31.72 points, so on 25-Jan-2021, it opened at $96.73.  This was seen again on the 26th, where a large gain happened during the market, and then a huge gain of 206.85 points (!) was realized in after hours trading, which led to a huge opening of $354.83 on the 27th.  The 27th (the highest peak day) actually saw a small loss during the open market, but still closed with the highest closing ever of $347.51.  The 28th is a slight anomaly due to Robinhood shenanigans, where a large loss was seen during the market, but after hours did not reflect this, and posted the second highest gain ever of 186.11 points, leading to the opening of $379.71 on the 29th.

On February 24, the market opened at $44.70, and it gained 47.01 points to close at $91.71.  After hours increased this by 77.85 points, and so the market opened on 25-Feb-2021 at $169.56.  Then a large loss of 60.83 points in the market happened leading to a close of $108.73.  After hours did not reflect the loss, instead gained 8.73 points. 

The trend of after hours trading leading to bigger gains began to change.  On March 8, the market had a gain of 39.61 points, and the after hours had a lesser gain of 23.21.  A similar pattern happened the next day.  On the 10th, the loss in after hours was greater than the loss had been for that day's trading. The 11th showed a rebound, with a gain bigger in the market than in after hours.  On March 25, there was a gain in the market of 60.26 points, and the after hours had a lesser gain of 13.93 points.  It was similar on the 30th.

Today (April 14th) we saw a gain of 22.93 points.  On 05-Apr-2021, there was a similar gain of 15.95 points in the market, but after-hours did not reflect this, and instead resulted in a small decline of 1.74 points.  

So, even though increases such as these had previously been accompanied by increases in the after market, I anticipate that, for now anyway, we won't wake up to a significantly better opening price tomorrow than our closing price of today.  I'm not sure why that is, though.",
mr49vv,guk2xio,wallstreetbets,comment,1618450508,"Really weird graphs. Not statistically significant IMO. Also if the 2 lines have been separated I assume you lose date continuity i.e. market activity -> after market -> pre-market -> market and so on. So what is a spike in after hours, is a continuation in price activity from the market hours. Unless the pricing is pure movement (% or absolute $ change from market open and market ""afterhours open"")

mrj8si,,wallstreetbets,post,1618506774,"Cattle Futures - buy the dip?Don't know what to buy? Buy SPX/SPY/ES and don't look back. Jeez how many times do we have to teach you, old man? 

Have a bit of spare change left? Consider buying some cattle, whose drop in the last few days does not make sense in light of faster economic growth and higher feed prices. 

[June 2021 Futures](https://preview.redd.it/6e9ns0kpbdt61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7e8427c27f04cc3e75c42e700a162fcf97aa08)

1. For cattle, the most important factor quite honestly is the supply. More cattle than what is demanded (domestically or internationally) means subdued prices. Right now, this is the primary driver, as [young calves raised in late 2020](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/market-outlook/) in anticipation of economic recovery in early 2021 are showing up on the lots. As of right now, demand is OK - just OK with Americans coming back to restaurants, even though the rest of the world isn't. Like what was driving oil prices (up to yesterday when the IEA upgraded all forecasts), the rest of the world is significantly lagging the US in recovery. 
2. Feed prices are critical to cattle as well (namely corn and soybeans). These have been on a tear in the past few weeks due to fewer than expected planted acres, and the current cold front across the midwest. If the feed becomes too expensive, it becomes more costly to fatten cattle, making less available to market, especially for the June contract as the time to fatten is now. 
3. The backlog is about to end. The massive oversupply has been in play for about 6 months already - from October to April. Every commodity has seen the same cycle post-pandemic - a massive depressing of prices, only for the entire market to realize they've been too pessimistic, and then sudden rally. 

&#x200B;

It seems like cattle is one of the last agri laggard - corn, soy, hogs and lumber have already punched through the roof. I'm heavily in corn gang, but overall I'm bullish all soft commodities. Buy a few contracts and see what happens, and I'll be sure to report back when I find 18 metric tons of beef on my front porch.",['ES']

mr0knr,,wallstreetbets,post,1618435996,"What happened today with PLTR is completely normal 

I know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.

However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.

Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.

mr1kyk,,wallstreetbets,post,1618439111,"$APHA discount, $TLRY merger soonHey ladies and gents, consider this post your friendly reminder that the thing we've all been waiting for (the APHA/TLRY merger) is just weeks away. Of course, this is a wendy's, not a financial consultancy, so this is not advice, but APHA's slide as of late is quite contrary to future market expectations with NY legalization and VA speeding things along. Schumer and the Dems have indicated legalization is a priority. Biden will probably(?) sign it.

APHA is at a large discount following this week's slide. (Roughly a 14% discount to be exact.) Consider that an APHA share = .83 TLRY shares and you have a pretty substantial gain to be made if you buy APHA at this price and it converts to TLRY at the current price of $17.40. My crayon-napkin math indicates a gain of about 2-3% using current prices.

On top of that, the combined entity TLRY (following the merger) will be the largest weed company by revenue, meaning they'll likely be able to swallow a lot of market share in the US and EU following U.S. legalization, the EU thing is already ongoing.

APHA as a discounted TLRY share is pretty good right now, especially because they move in parallel with TLRY always being more valuable. From there, seems like a hold on TLRY, which most actual advisors seem to agree with.",

Enough about me. Let’s talk stock. Let's talk Hyliion.

*Note: This is an interactive post. That means you're expected to click the links before you leave a dumbass comment.*

# HYLIION (HYLN): The fuck???

Hyliion is a company that develops and sells electric powertrain systems for transport trucks involved in long-distance trucking. Their drivetrain -- the Hypertruck ERX -- is fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and/or renewable natural gas (RNG), which are MUCH more green than diesel, which is used by most trucking companies. RNG can even achieve **negative emissions**. You know when you turn loose an earth-shaking fart in a very public setting, and you just wish you could suck that noxious gas back up inside you to avoid further humiliation from that flower-wilting smell? Well, this is almost identical to that. Kind of.

I know what you're thinking: *""So what? This dinosaur can un-fart gas. Aren't we moving away from gas and towards fully electric, hydrogen-powered, and nuclear fusion-powered vehicles anyway?""*

There's a few things to keep in mind:

* Stuff needs to get shipped TODAY
* There **aren't** enough plug-in refueling stations for **transport trucks** in the US
* There **aren't** enough hydrogen refueling stations in the US (only 39 currently)
* There **are** currently enough CNG and RNG refueling stations for the trucking industry
* CNG/RNG is currently 1/12 the price of hydrogen and 1/7 the price of electric refueling
* In the future, CNG/RNG will be 1/3 the price of hydrogen, and 1/2 the price of electric refueling
* HYLN's powertrain is designed specifically to be able to be used with hydrogen in the future, anyway
* Trucking companies aren't going to want to wait around [30 minutes](https://www.businessinsider.com/this-expert-says-tesla-semi-is-economically-and-ecologically-pointless-2019-2) for their trucks to get an 80% charge every [500 miles](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34774933/musk-now-says-621-miles-of-range-for-tesla-semi/) (source: latest max range \* 80%) using a theoretical megacharger station which [doesn't even exist](https://www.torquenews.com/11663/tesla-looking-develop-so-called-megachargers-tesla-semi-trucks) currently, and also lose 1 ton in carrying capacity due to the weight of the battery

HYLN's powertrain also offers other advantages:

* Increases efficiency and reduces cost of gas for truckers by up to 35% (one of the biggest costs for trucking companies)
* Drastically increases pulling power up hills (time is money, dongus)
* Software uses machine learning that optimizes driving patterns, introducing further savings
* Eliminates need for idling vehicle when truckers are staying overnight in the cabin with a couple of ""friends of the road""

I can hear you now: ""*But I like Tesla because that's what the attractive people on CNBC told me to like!""*

Tesla is pretty cool. But you know what else is cool?

*A* [*fucking battery*](https://i.ibb.co/NY8xcTT/hylnbattery.png) *that can recharge in 8 minutes, lasts 5x as long as conventional EV batteries, and is so safe that you can* ***shoot a fucking bullet and not worry about it exploding***\*.\*

You hear that sound?

*RING... RING...*

""Hello, who's there?""

""Yes, this is the US Military, and we would like to take your fucking stonk to $100 a share, please.""

**Key takeaway:**

Hyliion's powertrains will be an extremely important bridge for the transition from dirty diesel to hydrogen/electric powered vehicles. Hyliion's product will be able to run on hydrogen in the future. Hyliion has the most badass battery out there, and can be used for military and commercial purposes. HYLN's got ya bases covered, boy.

# Financials: Green Giant (Dick)

Hyliion is currently valued at 1.65b. It currently has 650m in the fucking *cash*. This means that the company is valued at less than 3x its current cash holdings. It's a sneeze away from being priced at bankruptcy value. So why is it valued so low? High debt? Burning through cash? Insiders selling? Bad news?

Fucking **nah**. None of those.

For starters, HYLN used some of its cash reserves to extinguish all of its debt last quarter. It currently has **no fucking debt**. That must be why Wall St hates the stock so much: Wall St really likes stocks that take out a shitton of debt so that they can help the company issue additional shares and dilute the stock and fuck over shareholders and allow bankers to pocket tidy sums. **No debt is good for the company**. **It's great for shareholders.** **Bankers hate this one simple trick**.

Now, it's true Hyliion had a negative earnings last quarter of -0.13. So, for every share, HYLN lost 13 cents over the quarter. Know what else had a negative EPS? Fucking *Amazon* in 2014. This shit doesn't matter to HYLN. They only lost 32m last year. They would have to lose that same amount every single year for 20 years -- and then not qualify for any loans -- before they want bankrupt. Not to mention that this 32m they lost last year factors in the debt that they paid off, so future losses should be even smaller! That shit is just unfathomable. They're a **growth** company. This year is when they're **supposed to** lose money. So when do they start making money? They're projecting 2b in revenue in 2024 -- y'know, *more than the entire market cap of the company currently.* Can you say ""undervalued""? I know it's a lot of syllables, so maybe ask your wife's private male yoga instructor to coach you through it.

# Hyliion and The News -- Why Good is Bad and Why Bad is Nonexistant:

Hyliion recently released two extremely positive pieces of news for the company:

1. The revolutionary EV battery
2. Formation of the Hypertruck Council

I already talked about the battery. The stock popped 70% after this press release and has since drastically sold off.

The formation of the Hypertruck Council is goddamn massive. Basically, HYLN assembled a group of industry leaders in logistics and trucking to help inform them of the best way to move the ERX towards mass commercialization. They'll be providing feedback, suggesting changes, conducting testing, and, presumably, eventually purchase their vehicles if they like what they see. And I'm not talking about some rinky-dink companies. I'm talking real Big Dick Boys with over a hundred thousand trucks that could potentially use HYLN's hypertruck. To name just a few: Agility Logistics, American Natural Gas, Wegmans Food Markets, Anheuser-Busch. You know that last one! They make the shitty beer your cool friend Dave used to open with his forehead and drink foamy beer from when you were still a virgin in college. The stock popped 11% the morning it was announced, and closed the day at 0%. What the fuck.

Hyliion hasn't released any new negative news. Their path to profitability is the same as it has always been.

# Recent Insider Sales (Simple English: These are bad!)

None.

# Recent Insider Buys (Simple English: These are good!)

[300,000 shares over the past 3 months](https://preview.redd.it/fedm83x61us61.jpg?width=789&auto=webp&s=c3fc1c8aacc7a2987e91c9eb05bfc151fd2b275a)

Insiders must believe in the company, otherwise they wouldn't be buying shares for MUCH higher than HYLN's current trading price.

&#x200B;

So, given all of this good shit, why is the stock red? Let's finally get to the meat and plums of this thing:

# HYLN Stock: redder than your crush's boyfriend's bed sheets on prom night

HYLN is down 83% from its all-time highs. By any metric, it was overvalued at ATHs. However, it's down 34% in the past month alone, and 63% in the past 6 months, when it was trading at a not unreasonable valuation for a growth stock. It's currently [oversold](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hyliion-holdings-is-now-oversold-hyln-2021-04-12), and trading below its long-term floor of $10. It's actually below the price that initial investors paid for the company when SHLL completed its acquisition of HYLN.

In fact, **every single person who has ever bought the stock (before today) is currently in the red.** And yet, the stock only has a daily [short volume of around 20%](https://i.ibb.co/C2XNDzR/hylnshortvol.png). How is this even *possible*? I think even you chimp-brains know the answer:

**Manipulation.**

[This article from GripRoom](https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-stock-is-being-manipulated) lists 10 different signs that a stock is being manipulated. HYLN fulfills 9/10. The only one it doesn't fulfill is #5: ""Bad news shaves off more market cap than it should"" -- because there wasn't *been* any bad news lately. Replace ""Bad news"" with ""Good news"" and we have a perfect score of 10/10.

# How HYLN is being manipulated

Mark Delaney, an analyst for Goldman Sachs with a commendable rating of 1000 out of 7000 analysts, and an average annual return of Roughly The Market Average Over The Past Ten Years % (according to [TipRankings](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/mark-delaney)), recently downgraded that stock to $9 a share. This was after downgrading the stock to $11 a share just two months prior. Once again, I must reiterate that there has been **no negative news for HYLN** during these past two months, and only very positive news. The same day he issued a Sell rating for HYLN, he issued a Buy target for Lordstown Motors (RIDE) with a price target 100% higher than its current trading price. He issued this Buy rating despite RIDE currently being [under investigation by the SEC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43555603/lordstown-motors-knew-of-sec-investigation-month-before-public-announcement) for fraud by misleading investors about [preorders, and other material information](https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/firm-exposed-nikola-calls-lordstown-motors-mirage).

So why is GS downgrading HYLN, and upgrading a company under investigation for fraud? It could have something to do with this:

>Lordstown CEO Steve Burns and DiamondPeak CEO David Hamamoto will sit on the combined company's board.  
>  
>Goldman Sachs is the exclusive financial adviser and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is the legal adviser to DiamondPeak, while Goldman Sachs is serving as exclusive placement agent on the PIPE offering.

In other words, Goldman Sachs:

* helped RIDE list on the major exchanges
* got paid to provide ""financial advice"" to the blank check company that acquired RIDE
* **has it in their financial interest to pump the stock in spite of fundamentals**

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs continues to downgrade HYLN while acquiring shares:

How credible is GS? I mean, they downgraded NIO to ""Sell"" July 17, 2020:

>Due to Goldman Sachs's downgrade on July 17, NIO stock gave up 14 percent of its gains

This was the lowest the stock has been since that day. The stock has risen over 240% since then. [Just read this article.](https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/goldman-sachs-downgrades-nio-stock/) It's fucking hilarious. Another choice quote:

>On June 2, Goldman Sachs upgraded NIO from neutral to buy. Then, 22 days later, the analyst downgraded the stock from buy to neutral based on its valuation. He downgraded NIO again 25 days later.

You could fucking right a book on this shit:

*From Neutral to Buy, and Back Again: How to Cuck Retail Traders in Just 50 Days!*

**These guys are fucking crooks.**

Another example. GS issued a [Buy rating for TSLA](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/goldman-sachs-upgrades-tesla-and-says-the-stock-has-massive-upside-of-over-30percent.html) on Dec 2, 2020. Six days later, they announced [an additional share offering with TSLA](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html). In other words, they pumped the stock so they could make more cocaine money from the share issuance.

So if you still haven't figured out why GS downgraded HYLN, let me spell it out for you: it's the same game that Wall Street always plays:

1. Rate the stock a ""Sell""
2. Watch price go down
3. Buy a bunch of shares
4. Wait for stock to rise drastically
5. Go back to step 1

I mean really, who are you going to trust -- some suit-wearing chud who's only up 16% YoY in a market that's up 50% YoY, and whose only experience with heavy-duty batteries is replacing the ones in his wife's overused vibrator -- or an [actual trucker](https://shorturl.at/dqDF9) who knows the ins and outs of the trucking industry?

I quote:

>“I know about truck driving. I know what trucking companies are looking for. I know what this type of product needs to be able to provide in order to be viable to the market. I know how truck drivers think. I know a lot about this industry. I’ve been doing this for a long time.”

Yeah, I think when I want to know about trucking, I'll probably go with the guy who pisses in bottles and collects VDs from all over the country, rather than the guy whose only experience with 18-wheelers was holding his wife's hand and telling her how pretty she looked while she filmed a scene for [TitsNTruckers.com](https://TitsNTruckers.com)

# Other sus sentiment manipulation

AKA how to turn rocket emojis into fear emojis:

1. [Brand new account made only to trash HYLN](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/mpqsce/no_insider_sold/gucn1pz/?context=3)
2. [This account is dead now](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty720), but the guy used to post 8 hours a day, every single day, exclusively Bearish posts about HYLN, using entirely and only emotional language. That's... that's not someone who's doing that for free.

Plenty of examples of this if you spend enough time on Stocktwits.

I wouldn't be surprised if the stock dropped below $10 to take out some stop losses and encourage selling in people promoting the ""If it breaks $10, there really is no floor!!!"" narrative, before bouncing summarily back above $10 and trending upwards again. But this part is pure speculation.

# Competent Management Team

These are some of management's heavy hitters:

Thomas Healy -- Founder and CEO -- made Forbes' ""30 under 30"" 2 years ago. Healy's a no-nonsense engineer. He's not a pump man, and he knows his stock is a longterm investment. HYLN is his third start-up, and he's been working on it since 2015.

Patrick Sexton -- Chief Technology Officer -- Served as Director of Engineering in Powertrain Innovations at Dana Incorporated for 6 years. This guy fucking *knows shit, and stuff*. AND he even has *Sex* in his name. He has a *ton* of *Sex* in his name. If that doesn't make you Bullish, I don't know what will.

Andy Card --  on the Board of Directors -- Former transportation secretary and WH Chief of Staff under George W. Bush. This is kinda, yknow, *the exact sort of guy you want working as a corporate director for your company*.

Sherri Baker -- CFO -- Worked with Dean Foods for 8 years and Frito Lay for 10 years.

# Finishing statements

I know a lot of y'all got burned by HYLN before, probably buying in at $50 a share like a bunch of retards. However, you have to ask yourself: do you like the *stock*, or do you like the *hype?* If it's the latter, then I recommend waiting until the stock is at $70 and buy in right before Mark Delaney downgrades the stock to $20 or something retarded. If it's the former, do your research, ask questions, and then throw your hands in the air and say ""Fuck it! It's too complicated!"" and go ask your fucking fortune teller what you should do.

Before I reading, I just want to express that predictions and dates should not be taken as absolute and that these are just my opinions on what COULD be coming. I am also well aware that correlation does not equal causation and that these correlations could be coincidences, so please don't comment that, these are just my thoughts based on research that I've done. I've done many posts on GME and these are all my personal opinions based on my research, so do not take them as fact. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

There's been an onslaught of news regarding GME in the past few weeks and days, and I believe that there is more to come and that because of that the squeeze is inevitable and in the near future.

**The news:**

\- Amazon + Chewey Execs being appointed

\- RC being named god of the board

\- GME announcing the search for new C.E.O.

\- GME paying off senior notes (today)

\- The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3.5M shares or $1B in value (this may not seem important but I'll explain why it's crucial later)

\- The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting (6/9 lmao)

**Why it matters:**

The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME, and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation. I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional. The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares. When GME made this announcement, the stock was at $190. GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens, the market would react negatively to the stock, and, because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting, that negative reaction could've been huge. Despite knowing this, they decided not to sell at that moment. I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190, they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so. With that being said, I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190. If this wasn't their plan, then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock, which it did. Finally, when almost every analyst (boomers) says that GME is grossly overvalued, it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless.... you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher. Therefore, I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock.

To add to this, GME has repeatedly warned in their S.E.C. filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze (they have said this twice since the original squeeze). This, to me, seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze. What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought (again just a theory).

**Catalyst**

But what could the next announcement be? It's very difficult to actually know. The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere. I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C.E.O. position or the digital transformation. GME could very well announce Cohen as the C.E.O., which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere. They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e-commerce. Again, this is simply conjecture, but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price. However, the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall. First, I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares, only individual investors can do that. If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears... oh wait. If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall, that could be the ultimate catalyst for us. Or, if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote, an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares (see my previous DD on that).

Personally, I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon, but I guess not. Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep. 

**Timing**

The timing on the possible above-mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect. First, our lord and savior Mr. Gill's calls expire this Friday. At the same time, GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume (pictured below). The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways. As many of you know, the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are. What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think ""wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap... time for some chaos."" Finally, we have the 4/20 (lmao) deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting. I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because, as I said previously, they have a vested interest in getting this above $190.

Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles (yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch):

&#x200B;

Finally, I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX. Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY, which seems to be true, but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX. This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad, but GME moves when the market is volatile (which usually happens when the market is bad). And, oh would you look at that, SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 (pre-pandemic levels). Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility. For more on this, I encourage you to read ""the everything short"" post, which provides a much more in-depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that.

Here are the charts. The first one is VIX and the second is SPY (both are the purple lines), as you can see, the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME. This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions. As stated previously, the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility, so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change. The thing to get from this is that, based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX, this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low:

https://preview.redd.it/92blf0gxm0t61.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9bd5bff8b3b6656ff1fda7c1a5336e59a596509

**Quick Note on Short interest**  

Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest. As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest. Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19%-50% which is still extremely high. Most apes say that it's over 100% at minimum. I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting, naked shorting, and synthetic longs (see other posts for more on this). Therefore, I believe that the true short interest is over 100%. It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2% with short interest being able 20% and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today. Also, based purely on logic, it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it, so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50%. Therefore, I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious. 

**Conclusion**

So, we have technicals lining up very nicely, a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now, a plethora of potential catalysts, a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled, abusive shorting, a failure to deliver cycle, an insanely volatile stock that loves good news, a market that is thirsty for some volatility, and oh year one more thing.... some damn primates that refuse to sell.

mr5spq,,wallstreetbets,post,1618454005,"$COIN = MOON POTENTIALHave been seeing a lot of negativity around Coinbase so wanted to provide an echo chamber for us bulls who FOMO'd in near the open.

First off, Coinbase should not be valued as an exchange, it makes no sense to compare it to Nasdaq or NYSE. COIN is rapidly growing, has a vastly different transaction structure, and is beginning to expand into the services market.

Now let's get into some numbers. 2020 Revenue was 1.28 B which is 140% growth over 2019, that is ridiculous. The really crazy number, 1.8 B in revenue for Q1 2021. They had 50% more revenue in Q1 2021 than the entirety of 2020. Let that sink in for a minute. Net Income for Q1 2021 was also around 750 M. If they were to sustain this net income for the rest of the year, that would put them at a 28 P/E ratio... for a company growing this quick? It's important to keep in mind that this was a record quarter for COIN and likely not sustainable near term but it still shows what they are capable of. 

Additionally, they announced that they are up to 56 million users with 6.1 of those being Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Q1 2021. This is a massive jump over the previous quarter and COIN explains that the rise in MTUs is largely due to the increase in price and volatility around virtual currencies. For some reference, Robinhood has 13 million monthly users but get nowhere near the revenue per user that COIN does. These ""virtual currencies"" have continued increasing so far in Q2 2021 so I am expecting another knockout quarter in both revenue and MTUs. Expect the Q2 earnings report to blow past expectations (think massive tendie spike).

Speaking of those beefy transaction fees that COIN gets, there's no way that's sustainable right? It's going to be a race to the bottom, just like the stock trading fees? Well, not exactly. Investors love how simple Coinbase makes trading and are willing to pay a small premium for this ease of use. Currently, fees are massive percentagewise for small trades but become pretty reasonable at a large scale. I could see them lowering rates significantly for these small trades once they build up some more consistent institutional trading revenue and service revenue. 

There's probably some reason to worry about declining margins in the transaction side of the business, however, that's not why COIN deserves to hit $500+. Coinbase's services platform is massively undervalued and is something the mainstream media largely ignores. This segment of the business is growing very quickly and should not be overlooked. If you look at what Cathie Wood says about digital wallets, it should be clear how much potential Coinbase has to monetize it's users. It's creating an entire financial ecosystem built around Coinbase that's designed to keep users around.

So I would like to start by saying that this thread was born as a reply to a user but, since it has become quite long and I think that some users might like to read it, I thought to post it directly. The discussion comes from a user who sends me 2 links, respectively

Well now let's read the comment that disputes my thread:

1 - ""You directly linked to a position of BR-FA ownership in GME, and now it is useless? Come on dude, do better""

The reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors. There are no updates since 2017!

2- ""That 13F-HR is the most recent holdings report. Can you show me where BR-FA sold?""

This is where it gets interesting. You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions. You can check it out for yourself:

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001006249&entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&startdt=2016-02-01&enddt=2020-02-01](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001006249&entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&startdt=2016-02-01&enddt=2020-02-01)

In lieu of submitting the 13F-HR, Black Rock Fund Advisor has begun submitting a 13F-NT form. What's different? Just open the Form to find out:

You can tell right away what is written there:

13F NOTICE. (Check here if no holdings reported are in this report, and all holdings are reported by other reporting manager(s).)

and

List of Other Managers Reporting for this Manager:

If there are no entries in this list, omit this section.

    	Form 13F File Number Name
    
    028-12019 BlackRock Inc.

&#x200B;

Look who is taking all the trouble to post the positions of their subsidiaries, but it is BLACK ROCK INC!!!!!!!

With this 13F- NT Black Rock Fund Advisor is basically saying: from today on, my daddy Black Rock Inc will take charge of everything I have!

From here on Black Rock Fund Advisor presented only 13F-NT form (and bought only 4-5 stocks to date).

But let's see what was happening to Black Rock Inc in the meantime....

These are the positions of BlackRock Inc on 2017-02-10 taken from 13F-HR:

What do you notice? Black Rock Inc had very few GME shares.

&#x200B;

But let's analyze the next 13F-HR submitted by Black Rock Inc on 2017-05-12:

But it's magic!!!! Black Rock Inc owns as many as 14 positions!!! But how is that possible!!!! Oh my god!!! Burn the witch!!!!

But let's analyze the front page of this Form 13F-HR from 2017-05-12:

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F\_X01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

&#x200B;

Let's analyze the most important passages:

13F COMBINATION REPORT. (Check here if a portion of the holdings for this reporting manager are reported in this report and a portion are reported by other reporting manager(s).)

and

Provide a numbered list of the name(s) and Form 13F file number(s) of all institutional investment managers with respect to which this report is filed, other than the manager filing this report.

If there are no entries in this list, state ""NONE"" and omit the column headings and list entries.

[Look who is on the list, but it is indeed BLACK ROCK FUND ADVISOR!!!](https://preview.redd.it/4a8h3z6nx7t61.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c29fb4eb43a2117bd7732eed42c953b2f764285)

&#x200B;

With that I have shown you how from 2017-05-12 onwards Black Rock Inc has taken over the position of all their subsidiaries. The evolutions of those GME positions over time you can check for yourself.

&#x200B;

Let's come to the other point made by the user

""Also, in your Fidelity sale filing, pay attention to section 7. They moved the securities to another company.

""Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.

See attached Exhibit A.""

Here he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the Fidelity GME sale posted on the GME forum. I have already replied to this kind of comment and I paste one of my answers:

I've already been shown the thread you mean ( you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k ). The author of the post is simply wrong because:

&#x200B;

1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares

2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards?

3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C    I      K's.

&#x200B;

I would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares.

&#x200B;

I want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: since so many people ask for it here is a TLDR

TLDR: Fidelity does not own any GME stock, all the positions you see on the finra site ie: Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, FMR Inc and Fidelity Management and Research Company are an error. Fidelity sold in January.  Instead the position of Black Rock Inc which owns 9,217,335 is confirmed. The other Black Rock Fund Advisors which owns 10m shares is wrong. 

&#x200B;

TLDR's TLDR: The finra data are completely wrong and are not to be taken into account","['BR', 'BLK', 'EL']"
