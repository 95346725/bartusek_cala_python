lv5dlb,gpbcy3e,stocks,comment,1614617395,"Swedish investor here. Been investing for about four years now. I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The main fuel supply line to the U.S. East Coast has shut down indefinitely after the pipeline's operator suffered what is believed to be the largest successful cyberattack on oil infrastructure in the country's history — presenting a danger of spiking gasoline prices and a fresh challenge to President Joe Biden's pledges to secure the nation against threats.

A shutdown that lasts more than a few days could send gasoline prices in the Southeastern U.S. spiking above $3 a gallon, market analysts said. That could deepen the political risks the incident poses for Biden, stealing momentum from his efforts to center the nation's energy agenda on promoting cleaner sources and confronting climate change.

This could be the most serious successful attack the U.S. has faced yet.

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
> The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&P technology sector.
*****
> The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
> The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
> “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
> Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
> The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
> Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
> The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
> Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
> “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
> # Tech battleground
> The S&P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
> In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
> Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
> The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
> Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
> “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
> “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
> Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
> “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
> Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
> “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
> Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

> # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

> After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

> As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

> While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

> While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

> # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

> As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

> Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

> To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

> # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

> Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

> Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

> “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

> Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

> # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

> One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

> With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

> Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

> “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&P 500 Index earnings growth.

> So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

> # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

> The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

The FED and numerous others have said multiple times they think elevated inflation is temporary and significantly related to supply problems from COVID rather than QE. We've had lower than expected inflation for a few years (<2%), and they're predicting an elevated level that might even some of that out (2.4-2.6%). I get interest rates will go up, but they've been so incredibly low for awhile and like Yellen said we've had them much higher before and it's not like the economy stopped.

n8dhxx,,stocks,post,1620564198,"Stocks to hold forever?Hi I’m turning 19 soon and I have invested 90% of my savings since last year to have a combined net worth of little more than 13k. I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.

My main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I’ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don’t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:

- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

  My stock is Kaleyra (KLR). Its an Italian company, a competitor of Twilio but in its infant stage. Its a very undervalued tech play as well: its valuation is only  $380 million, compared to Twilio's massive $52 billion. Why do I pick Kaleyra, instead of Twilio, or any other competitor? It operates as a bridge in the communication process of  App-Cloud-Message-Customer. A simple SMS from your bank app or Uber happens thanks to a company like Kaleyra.  Also provides communications involving chatbots, verification process, voice messages, Whatsapp messages, you name it.   Its a sector that keeps growing more and more and has significant barriers of entry. Here some points: 

\-It has a prices-to-sales ratio of 2, yes, only 2!. 

\-Kaleyra operates mainly in Europe, India, and its gaining ground in the US thanks to a very recent acquisition. It has a lot of know-how in the financial industry.

\-It is cash-flow positive. 

\-It has among its clients Twilio. Yeah, its main competitor has been its client. Plus other 3500 enterprise customers. 

\-It got its debut last year in Wall Street. With the acquisition of Mgage, its projected to double its revenue in a year or less. The stock price has suffered lately, no bad news whatsoever, just affected by the market in general and shorters: 15% of its stocks are shorted. 

\-Twilio is the absolute leader of this sector, with a better growth rate and better margins. However, a company like Kaleyra, with such a small valuation and great growth prospects, offers a potential multi-bagger possibility in a shorter time. Next earning report is next Monday.

It’s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF’s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden. I own a couple shares and so does my spouse. 
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report. I am long a handful of shares here. 


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I’m good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car! (I own both tickers)

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you’re bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.(I own some shares and thinking of selling short term cash secured puts depending on the premium)

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. (Own a handful)

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.(have about a grand in here so one of my small mid positions)

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I’m sure you’ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that’s why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that’s some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn’t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery’s and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he’s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html (I am
Long Amazon)

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.( I am long)

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216. (I am long)

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you’re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don’t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.

I realize that higher risk is involved with  stocks going through high growth but I am willing to take my chances. What factors or stats do you look at when wanting to know how a stock is performing and how rapidly it’s growing?,
n8i1z4,gxijijj,stocks,comment,1620579958,"Just be aware that maximum growth also means maximum loss. If you're investing in a high growth company, you're betting heavily on future revenue and trying to pull forward the future value of a company to today.

I like to personally look at how fast revenue is growing QoQ and YoY. If revenue is growing at 50%+ YoY, companies can start seeing nose bleed valuations as investors will buy the stock today with the expectation that it will grow into its valuation in the future.

The other factor that matters a lot is P/S. When looking at revenue, if every stock was just mapped 1:1 to its current revenue, it would be an uninteresting game. P/S multiplier allow for different industries to have different mkt cap valuations despite pulling in the same revenue.


Overall, when you invest in growth companies, things can start getting out of your normal comfort zone as you'll have to justify why a company deserves to have traditional metrics that fall outside the mean.  For example: P/S multiples, willing to forgive debt ratio, focusing on subscribers/customers without focusing on profits, etc.

Also a huge factor is market sentiment. A company growing revenues 50% YoY in an uninteresting market may never see the stock price growth it deserves. Human psychology and the investing ""mob"" can move against you even if you picked a winner.


If you're looking for maximum growth, you need to first identify what markets will see the largest inflow of customers and revenue. Through 2020, the biggest growth industries were green energy, cloud stocks and EVs. All three had tailwinds of COVID WFH, huge revenue growth and speculation of political policies. But most of that hype has died down in the past 3 months.

Another high growth industry right now is genetics and bioengineering. Its a market in its infancy, and with that comes lots of risks of regulation, consumer acceptance and marketization. Investing in companies like EDIT, CRSP, ILMN, NVTA, etc could yield huge returns in the next 10 years if those things go in your favour.

In the next 12 months, the biggest growth may be in housing, construction and industrials. We're seeing price inflation in raw inputs and a rotation into manufacturing due to COVID reduction. Investing in more speculative businesses in this market (ie. 3D printing, commodities, etc) may yield good returns. Maybe look at the holdings in NAIL and identify which ones have the highest revenue growth potential.

Cybersecurity is also very hot right now. Investors may be willing to accept very high P/S multiples to buy cybersecurity firms because of the secular tailwinds with the transition of nation state proxy wars moving from the battlefield to cyberspace. Companies like FEYE, CRWD, ZS, NET, QLYS may work for your favour.",['ILMN']

If all is accurate this is what I found.

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They  just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led  by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of  his own money
3. Completed  the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the  company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

Doordash is in a similar boat. The little money they make comes through bullying and exploiting the restaurants they work with, to take some of the margins, and even that is no where near close to covering expenses.

n8i6vl,,stocks,post,1620579058,"BIGC earnings on May 11, could see a recovery from recent slideBIGC is an e-commerce company that competes with SHOP. The difference between BIGC and SHOP is that BIGC targets large companies and is more focused on customization of their shop front.

BIGC has recently been clobbered by the tech company bear market, seeing a price slide to ATL, well below its IPO opening price. The IPO was priced at $25, BIGC started trading at $80, and after some peaks to $120, its been on a slide consistently down where it has now settled at $48. So really, $25 --> $48 in the ultra-realitic case.

BIGC saw a small jump in its price after releasing its earnings on February 26, but returned back to its slide since then. https://investors.bigcommerce.com/node/7361/html#ITEM_8_FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS_SUPPLEMENTAR

In 2020, they saw 45% profit growth over 2019, which is a big jump from 2018-->2019.

At their current price point, they have a P/S of 21, which is on the low end for a tech e-comm company, especially since the comparisons to SHOP are direct. SHOP comparatively is at a PS of 40.

Now, here's the interesting risk/reward part. BIGC is trading at a level where a strong revenue beat, and projections of 50% revenue growth YoY could drive up the stock price with a 50% upside potential. Here's my logic:

Current P/S is 21 with a current revenue of $152M in 2020. Growth from 2019 to 2020 was 50%. So right now, it seems that revenue growth has not been factored into the price yet, and BIGC is in undervalued territory. If BIGC sees revenue in Q1 of $55M, that means they're on track to hit $220M for 2021, which is 50% revenue growth from 2020 to 2021. If that happens, BIGC now enters a trajectory to justify BOTH a higher multiplier (like SHOP) and a price increase based on the current multiplier.

BUT, here's the risk part. If BIGC misses revenue, and only gets revenue of $40M, I expect its stock to crash all the way to $25. BIGC is at ATL, and the only support below its current price is at $25 which was the IPO price. So the downside right now is 50% loss vs 50% gain. It almost feels like a blackjack hand.

Its also important to note that BIGC missed revenue in Q4 by 10%, coming in at $32M instead of $38M estimate. So maybe the dreams of a $55M quarter may be aspirational.",

n80bmo,,stocks,post,1620513573,"Alibaba: A Short Analysis**What does Alibaba do?**

First and foremost, they are an online commerce platform. They sell retail, they sell wholesale, they sell single items, they sell container loads of items. This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network, Cainiao Network, and an on-demand delivery and services platform, Ele.me. Then, they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment, gaming and other business units, but in this analysis I'll mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibaba's business strategy.

So, let's look at the online commerce. Is it doing well? Well? It's doing fantastic! The last year, it grew by 35% YoY! Over the last 5 years, online commerce sales increased by almost 500% from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020. To give you an idea, 1 US dollar was roughly 7.08 RMB then so Alibaba's online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly $61.5 Billion. Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing! In fact, this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is. Then, the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22% to 165 billion RMB or $23.4 billion. So, how are they doing THAT well? Simple! They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic, but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020. They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users. Essentially, they've got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINED!

So, Alibaba's online marketplaces include several websites, but not just any websites. In fact, the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN. THE. WORLD. Tmall and Taobao. Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place. The company presence is just mindboggling. And, to top it all off, the business model is much lighter than Amazon's, for example. Why? Well, Alibaba does not sell its own products, it doesn't have any inventory, doesn't have any warehouses, which results in less expenses and a higher net profit. How much higher? Well, Amazon's latest net profit margin is 5.53%. Alibaba's? 24.71%!

So, the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibaba's amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings. In fact, the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money, although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable, but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform. Now, the cloud computing is different. In the 4th quarter of 2020, it finally broke even! It is an important part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it. In 2020, cloud revenues grew by almost 62%! Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that way.

Overall, the company is growing fast, roughly 38% increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70% in the last year! We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well. How are its financials though? Well, it has a lot of cash, roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy. In fact, they've got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares. In the final quarter of 2020, they repurchased roughly $110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly, but they've approved a share repurchase plan of between $6 and $10 Billion. If we see them acting on that plan, investors could get very excited! So, the business is growing fast, the financials look solid, they're starting to return money to the shareholders. What about their price?

Well, the company is relatively cheap right now. Their PE ratio is 25.5 with a forward PE of 20.6. Historically, they have a PE average of 34.5 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now. Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so there's that. Compared to their direct Chinese competitors, Alibaba's PE isn't actually that low, but I'd say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Also, if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments, we can see that Amazon's PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 137.2, way higher than Alibaba! Amazon's PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibaba's! Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020.

But, they've also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them. Basically, we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal, at least in my opinion. It's no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY (Yahoo finance screenshot). Also, most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them. It's got better sales, better net profit margin, better brand presence, better long-term strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo, Vipshop, JD. Clearly, it's the better deal, at least in my opinion, but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well. Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20% of his Daily Journal portfolio.

Now, this stock just looks to good to be true, right? Sort of. Alibaba does have some issues, but they're of slightly different nature. The main risks involved with the company are more... political. First of all, you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military, that don't provide proper financial statements and reporting, that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government. Now, technically speaking, just because a company is delisted doesn't mean that you cannot trade it, but chances are that its stock price will be hurt... A LOT. You'd still be able to trade it over-the-counter, but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers won't support it. I know that my broker, eToro, does not. Still, you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibaba's stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The ticker is 9988, but it's essentially the same stock. Personally, I don't think that's going to happen, but don't take my word for it. Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delisting.

That isn't all though. Currently, there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies. Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma, its founder, made criticised the Chinese government's approach to financial regulations. As a result, the IPO for Ant Group, which is essentially Alibaba's spin-off that deals with consumer financing and lending, was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered. More recently, more regulations and restructuring was ordered. While this has affected Alibaba's business model to an extent, the regulations have also affected Alibaba's direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage. The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of $2.8 BILLION US dollars, the biggest one ever handed... so far. They also ordered the company to stop its anti-competitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms. So, are the regulators finished with Alibaba? Well, we can only speculate. The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses, which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies. They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies, but as I said this is not something that you can know for certain.

So, what's the verdict? Is Alibaba a good investment right now? Personally, I think so. It is undoubtedly risky, but the company offers such amazing prospects that it's just crazy to miss out on. I mean, if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price, wouldn't you? I'd recommend doing your own research into it, but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and that's why it is my second largest holding and almost 10% of my total portfolio. 

Finally, Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen. There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it, hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectory.

That's my analysis on Alibaba. There's a lot more to talk about, but I wanted to keep it on the short side. What do you think?

In this case (let's ignore any deductions for simplicity and single filer) ur total income is 180k + 39k

Ur taxable income is the same (since we keeping this simple and ignoring deductions) 

Ur ordinary income is 39k. Ur long term gains is 180k.


Ur taxes are now as followed

* 10% on first 9950 = 995
* 12% on 9951 - 39k = 3486

Now long term gains.

* 0 - 40400 is 0% so ur first 1400 of ur 180k is taxed at 0%
* leftover 178600 is 15% = 26790

Total taxed just add them up.

Easiest analogy i was told is to think of tax bracket as buckets. And income as water of different colors.

U first fill up the bucket with regular water (ordinary income. Ie most commonly from ur job) and next fill it up with red water (LTCG).

n8ieiz,,stocks,post,1620579659,"How to value stocks as a non-professional?Hey, I have been investing in the stock market now for a couple of years. Started out as a very passive index ETF investor, but during the last year have transitioned my portfolio to be more stock heavy.  Due to this I have started to do my own research into individual companies. I find it somewhat easy with my value investing goals to identify good companies. The part I find extremely difficult (and I understand that I am not alone and that this is a multi-trillion dollar question) is to identify what is the ""fair"" value of a company?

I have tried to create my own DCF models and understand all the variables that go in to evaluating a company, but I have very quickly realized that I am way way out of my depth.

I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company.  Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

So my question is to the non-pro veterans of the stock market (or to anyone who has had success in getting a good value for their picks), how should an investor know when to buy when they think they have found a wonderful company?

English is not my first language so sorry for any spelling errors or otherwise weird sentences!",['MSFT']

The past year has taught me there is no one answer. You're asking a fundamental question about consumer psychology. Why is TSLA valued at 600x PE ratio while GM and F are at 10 and 11 respectively?

Fair value is very subjective and you'll find detractors and zealots on both sides of the argument.

I primarily look at projected future revenue and industry comparative P/S multipliers. This is myopic though as there are lots of other factors that matter including debt levels, P/B ratio, etc. I'm aware of this, but since I have a day job, I can't spend all my extra time doing complicated FA for every company I want to invest.

> I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company. Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

What you're talking about is not ""fair value"" but market sentiment. I think you'll never be able to reconcile the two. For every stock you buy thats further way from rational P/S, P/E, P/B and DCF levels, the higher risk you're taking that your investment will get blown out. But those companies are also the ones that return the highest returns if you got in early.

The short answer: You can't.

The most important answer: Invest in companies you're 100% committed and convicted. Only invest in companies that you'll defend to your dying breath. That people get annoyed when you bring them up because you talk about them so much. Anything else will create doubt and give you paper hands when the stock turns the other way.

n82716,,stocks,post,1620519632,"Buying overvalued stocks.Just want to get some experience and opinions here.  Obviously we should avoid overvalued stocks, because best case scenario there's not so much room to run, and worst case scenario they can actually plummet.  By overvalued I mean when the market value of the stock exceeds its intrinsic value, which can be calculated in different ways.  I find both [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) and [macroaxis.com](https://macroaxis.com) useful for a quick, automated reading.  I also understand that you can calculate it by hand, which I don't thanks to the wide variety of resources and analysts out there.

Anyway, I think most people would agree that the market is pretty high right now.  Are there deals to be had?  For sure!  And I think if you can find them, then that's obviously the best option.

But what do you guys think about buying a company that is slightly overvalued according to traditional metrics?  I'm not talking about Tesla here.  I'm talking about a blue-chip stock that may be trading 5-15% over what's considered fair.

Arguments against: it's a bad deal.

Arguments for: it may have more room to run, and time in the market beats timing the market.  If it's a good company you'll eventually recoup the initial investment and make gains even if it takes a bit longer.

Also keep in mind that I'm a small-time retail investor, as I'm sure many of us are.  Let's imagine I want to invest $1000 and I find a company with a fair value of $90, but it's trading at $100 currently.  I decide to go ahead and buy it, which would mean I'm paying a $100 premium for 10 shares of that company.

Is $100 really a big deal?  Again, as long as it's a good company with realistic prospects for growth, then sooner or later the stock's intrinsic value will surpass the market value.  You're out $100 that you could have invested in better value, but at the same time you've locked yourself in to a good company with good long-term growth prospects.

If it were a $100,000 investment, of course, you have a bigger issue.  Percentage wise it's the same, but I think you could argue that an extra $100 isn't really worth splitting hairs about.  $10,000 might be.

I also considered that you could balance out overvalued companies with undervalued ones.  Instead of buying 10 overvalued companies, which start to add up, you could lock yourself into 5 high-conviction overvalued companies, and balance them out with 5 undervalued plays to net a fair purchase value.

What do you guys think?  Do you buy overvalued companies, or do you do all that you can to avoid them?",['TSLA']

Your 'argument for' doesn't really make sense. The only argument for buying an overvalued company's stock is that your valuation, and anyone else who thinks it is overvalued, could be wrong.

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM).

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021.

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+.

This is largely due to COVID restrictions being lifted as well as Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Now let’s focus a little on the infrastructure bill aspect. There’s a lot of speculation which companies will benefit the most from this. Though trying to pinpoint who’ll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let’s focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains.

if you buy a stock at 10$, sell it at 13$. that’s 13-10=3, and then 3/10 x 100 = 30%",

n7mz6p,,stocks,post,1620472158,"LMND - an over valued insurance stock pretending to be a tech stock?I got caught up in LMND during the January hype and I now I'm a bag holder. It's made me look at LMND in more detail and really dissect their financials. Below is a short DD on LMND looking at their 10K annual report in preparation for their Q1 report coming out on Monday.

https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001691421/7d400e55-689a-4fc1-9a55-28ce9601dc6e.pdf

To begin, LMND is an insurance provider that is looking to disrupt the insurance marketplace using AI to handle claims and drive high customer support.

LMND is currently trading at MktCap of 5B with a P/S multiple of 52. Compared to other incumbents in the pure insurance industry:

ALL: P/S - 0.89, MC - 40B

PGR: P/S - 1.39, MC - 62B

TRV: P/S - 1.26, MC - 40B

So obviously LMND is trading at a multiple that treats it more like a tech company than an insurance company. But lots of companies want to be valued at a multiple of a tech company vs insurance company, so lets dig deeper.

LMND made 94BM in revenue in 2020 with a YoY growth of 40%. In their earnings call in March, they stated that they expect greater growth slowdown in 2021...so there's definitely reason to be cautious here given that their mkt cap multiplier is totally based on growth projections.

Here's the troubling part of LMND. Even though their revenue is growing aggressively, their net losses are stacking up too. In 2019 they had net loss of 108M on 67M of revenue, and in 2020 they had net loss of 120M in 94M of revenue. So though their net losses aren't growing at the same rate as their revenue, they're definitely not closing the gap at a great rate. The biggest contribution to their net losses is G&A and technology development. G&A can't be helped as I assume they went on a hiring blitz in 2020. But their investment in ""technology development"" increased 98% from 9.8B to 19.4B. 

While G&A is straight forward as employee compensation, Technology Development is listed as follows:

Technology development - Technology development consists of employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and benefits, and expenses related to vendors engaged in product management, design, development and testing of the Company's websites and products. Technology development also includes allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount.

Pretty abstract stuff...

Okay, so lets make some projections. The simplest projections is that we're seeing a big shift in the tech market place as a bear market has taken hold the past 3 months. May doesn't look any better, but many of these high flying ""tech stocks"" are now seeing a reduction in multiple. Even if LMND could grow their revenue by 200% this year, if the market starts valuing them like an insurance company and not a tech company (a la RKT), we'll see LMND's price tank into the mid 20's and maybe even lower.

The second projection is if we look at growth of revenue. In their Q4, Lemonade said they are seeing slowdown in a key growth metric:

https://news.futunn.com/en/post/8971338?level=1&data_ticket=1620471675650956

The stock tanked to $113 from $132, and has been on a slide since then, influenced by general tech stock malaise. Even at its current price of $79 it seems over valued in some regards.

Here are the key metrics to look for. LMND is projecting revenue in Q1 to be 22M. That would set it on base to make about $100M in CY2021. Which isn't spectacular growth to justify its valuation, as it slows the growth rate down to 10% YoY.

Overall, LMND stock looks really dicey at the moment. Given this information, I'm probably going to unload half my bags before earnings and see what the news is. If the news is good, then I'll hold the other half and hope to reduce my losses. Otherwise, I plan to immediately unload the remaining half if the growth numbers look bad since this will ensure another 3 month slide in price. If growth numbers are bad, expect LMND to fall below their IPO price.

LMND did an offering at $165/share in January. I feel real bad for anyone who has their cost average that high, because looking at their financial statements and projections, LMND doesn't look like they'll get back up there in 2021.



Last note, I think LMND is aiming for an AI holy grail to do their real disruption. They're hoping that if they can handle all claims using AI (of which, currently AI Jim, their claims AI, handles 95% of all claims), they may be able to drive down their costs of doing business so aggressively that their margins become industry leading. Company's like ALL, TRV and PGR have demonstrated that they are too large and bureaucratic to offer solutions like this. So right now, this is the only saving grace of LMND imho.

Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

n7ngj5,,stocks,post,1620474099,"Rebalancing? Long-term strategyHi all,

I hope I will get some critical feedback on my question on rebalancing:

I don´t wanna write an essay here so I will try to make this quick:

1) I am a super long-term investor 

2) I have around 95% of my money in stocks/crypto

3) I automatically put a lot of money in stocks every month and will continue to do so. Most of the money goes into Tesla, Nasdaq100 and additionally into the individual big tech firms, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook & Co and some broader, more global ETFs 

Right now I have quite a lot of money (also from one-time investments) in Nasdaq100 and individual stocks like Apple, Amazon & Co. I pretty much see them as my cash equivalent, but I also see them getting bigger and bigger. That´s why I invest into them on a monthly basis.

However, since right now in the current market, high growth potential stocks are getting hammered I see a lot of potential in investing into them, since I see a lot more potential, since fundamentally I think almost nothing has changed but only becuase of markoeconomical reasons, they are getting slaughtered.

Since I don´t have any cash, my idea was to rebalance a little bit.

E.g. Sell Amazon/Apple and buy Teladoc 

I don´t want to argue about Teladoc here, it´s just an example.

In my opinion, Teladoc has a very bright future, it has really good fundamentals, high growth curve and will (again in my opinion) exponentially grow in the next years/decades.

Since e.g. Teladoc is down by 50% from ATH, what do you think about that?

I know, that evaluations in generall with these high growth companies were pretty high (also because of all the FED money pumped into the markets), but a decrease by 50% in that short of a time just seems crazy to me, especially because I think its only happening because of the overall market and not because of fundamentals of that individual company.","['TSLA', 'FB', 'NDAQ', 'AAPL', 'AMZN']"

Or they had tons of hype dumped into them, they shot up which attracted more people, and now we’re seeing them fall down to reasonable levels. 


> Since I don´t have any cash, my idea was to rebalance a little bit.


If it’s done correctly then it can pay off. However the point of rebalancing is to reduce volatility/risk, not to increase gains. You’re in individual stocks and crypto...that’s about as risky as it gets and now you’re wanting to add speculative high growth stocks? Yikes. I’d step back and figure out why you’re doing what you’re doing. 


> E.g. Sell Amazon/Apple and buy Teladoc 


This entire comment isn’t financial advice....I think it would be better to sell Tesla and buy VTI or VOO.


> I don´t want to argue about Teladoc here, it´s just an example......In my opinion, Teladoc has a very bright future, it has really good fundamentals, high growth curve and will (again in my opinion) exponentially grow in the next years/decades. Since e.g. Teladoc is down by 50% from ATH, what do you think about that?


You don’t want to argue about teladoc...but then give bad reasons on why you should buy it. 


IMO. There’s typically reasons why stocks fall 50%. That isn’t normal for stocks to fall 50% for no reason. You’re missing information and I think it would be wise to avoid such stocks you don’t understand. 


> I know, that evaluations in generall with these high growth companies were pretty high (also because of all the FED money pumped into the markets), **but a decrease by 50% in that short of a time just seems crazy to me, especially because I think its only happening because of the overall market and not because of fundamentals of that individual company.**


This right here shows your lack of knowledge. TDOC is not profitable, management has said growth in the company will be very little in 2021, and by some analysts they might experience negative growth. I think it was their Q1 results, analysts set a target of -$0.50 a share and TDOC ended up with -$1.30 something. In other words they lost a lot of money. You’re also forgetting that TDOC operates in a space with no business moat, what’s stopping a competitor from doing the same thing they’re doing? I’ll give you a hint, there are bigger competitors starting to enter the telehealth space. Also what’s stopping doctor’s offices from providing their own teladoc like services for cheaper?


Edit: Honestly. To me it seems like you’re wanting to trim your flowers to plant weeds. You’re better off “rebalancing” to VTI or VOO imo.","['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']"

Please help me understand,['PPL']
n7j2lr,gxd6xby,stocks,comment,1620459260,"I mean, this is probably of no use because it's obvious, but when someone says a stock is undervalued, it means **they think** that the market price of a company is lower than the company is really worth. If someone says they think Apple is undervalued, it is tantamount to saying that Apple is actually worth more than the $2.17 trillion that the market says its worth (for the record, **I** think such a claim would be patently ridiculous). 

It's up to you to figure out how you determine a company's value. A long time ago people relied on tangible assets and cash equivalents against debts to form the base value of a company (sort of like book value), the idea being that the company is worth at least what its owners would get if they decided to close shop and liquidate everything. But this isn't really a great way to value most companies, at least because no company exists with the intention to close shop and liquidate its assets---it would presumably only do so to end an unprofitable enterprise or by force of insolvency. 

The hot-button issue in valuation is obviously how much a company has earned in the past and, especially, **how much you think it will earn in the future**---this is where the most divergence of opinion on value happens, and unfortunately it's also the point where we're the least confident (or, at least, we should be). If a company earns $1 million this year, the market says it's worth $10 million, and you're confident it will earn $100 million a year in 5 years, then you might say that the market is severely undervaluing the company because it's not thinking about the company's potential appropriately. But this is down to what **you** think, and the result comes down to whether or not you were right. Hint: You'll be wrong almost all of the time, because no one can predict the future, and you're no exception to the rule.",['AAPL']

n6yu2y,,stocks,post,1620395093,"Tesla Saw New Registrations Drop 25% In Germany In April, While Volkswagen Saw 108% RiseThis popped up on my TD Ameritrade app this morning:

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”

The below 11 holdings (of 43) constitute 52% of my portfolio. They are my current main plays, and I do detailed DD at 4% or if I see myself increasing my holding to 4%, and are long term hold.

&#x200B;

Feedback / questions / comments welcome. Happy to go into more detail, but for now have just done a very brief rationale for my positions:

&#x200B;

**£ Hollywood Bowl:** 8.35%. Love this company, branding, numbers (pre-Covid), great management, solid track record and steady growth (also pre-Covid).

**$ Microsoft:** 6.00%. It's just a great company doing well. Diverse, growing, and hungry. It's a growth and divi growth play.

**$ BMY:** 5.36%. Obviously disappointing results, but the treatments they have I believe will recover, plus solid looking pipeline at fairly advanced stages.

**$ AT&T:** 4.67%. I'm bullish and like what I see, from wireless to HBO. I work in backend telco systems and I delved into the Jan QTR end figures for their wireless division and loved what I saw, so increased my holding materially before the latest very impressive results.

**$ EPD:** 4.56%. Defensive and divi, feels undervalued, I like that it has a significant pipeline network built, port and storage infrastructure, significant LNG exposure, and had pretty robust results consider 2020 (commodity prices, Texan weather and Covid dampening demand.

**£ Games Workshop:** 4.52%. Crazy margins, great CEO / management, expansion possibilities, lore on point. It's up 23x over 5 years with divi reinvested, 18x without, it's a beast that'll be in the FTSE100 end of 2023, likely sooner.

**£ Sage Group:** 4.23%. Bit un-noticed but does HR / payroll / finance and is geographically well diversified and under loved. Legacy tech but I like it, divi and buybacks. I generally feel CRM systems (Salesforce most notable) get all the attention because obviously they're meant to drive sales, but other internal systems matter and are in desperate need of modernisation. (If you want a sexier but higher risk play if you accept this logic, consider Workday).

**£ Fevertree Drinks:** 3.8%. Convinced this company will be a monster, and maybe the next Monster. Originally a tonic specialist for Gin, it's targeting both international and other mixers for expansion. Market hugely over-reacted to decent results considering Covid, and I opened a sizeable position.

**$ CACI International:** 3.77%. Also a bit unnoticed, it's a software meets military intelligence and Gov IT company. No divi, and they are quite clear they have no intention of it (literally a Buffett approach, we can use the money better than you.. :)), but winning contracts and very deeply ingrained with US Gov / military.

**$ HBAN**: 3.76%. Regional US bank digesting an acquisition. I like the direction. Recent numbers were so-so and dipped to $14.50, which is was a chance for me to add 80% to my previous holding.

**$ HUN:** 3.2%. Funny story here, I found this by accident when HBAN dipped to $14.50 as was looking for data to understand that drop and put in ""Hunt"" for Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and accidently went to Huntsman Corporation (HUN). Lucky for me I guess, as I was curious and liked what I saw. I was frantically buying under $28, and although the shares shot up following good results and a 15% divi increase, I still like it. I see nobody talking about them,  but they have made significant changes to their business over the last couple of years, so although revenue is falling, earnings are looking great. It's become a leaner business with a war chest for suitable acquisitions, seems undervalued and has a respectable and now fast growing divi.","['CRM', 'BMY', 'HBAN', 'MSFT']"

n7l8u3,,stocks,post,1620464855,"QQQ Research + QuestionsI am very new to investing. I would like to try ETFs and am looking at the pros/cons of different ones starting with QQQ. Any advice or answers to questions is very much appreciated.

**What is QQQ?**

Invesco QQQ is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Index includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq based on market cap.

QQQ is the most direct way to “invest” into the Nasdaq-100 index as it tracks it and is passively managed. It is heavily based on technology. This seems like it can be a con as it is “less diverse” or a pro if you are bullish in tech.

**Top 10 Allocation: (**[**https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html**](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html)**)**

**AAPL: 10.95%**

**MSFT: 9.50%**

**AMZN: 8.32%**

**TSLA: 4.24%**

**FB: 3.78%**

**GOOG: 3.62%**

**GOOGL: 3.31%**

**NVDA: 2.69%**

**PYPL: 2.31%**

**INTC: 2.11%**

**48.11% of total stocks are in the information technology sector.**

[https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html)

It consistently outperforms it’s common comparison being the S&P 500 Index.

A 10,000 dollar investment in QQQ on March 31st 2011 would become 61,493 dollars today, compared to 36,756 dollars from the S&P 500 index.

QQQ is considered a riskier ETF than the S&P because of how technology based it is, meaning more of a capital gains ETF where S&P involves more mature companies.

Many people worry about a crash similar to the dot come crash where it took several years for QQQ to recover. If a crash like this happened, is that not a market wide thing? I don’t see why QQQ would be affected any worse than other stocks that crash.

Personally, I am looking to put extra monthly income in ETFs such as, ARKK, ARKG, VTI, and VXUS along with QQQ and see what that gets me in the next 3-5 years. I just don’t know at what % to balance each to have a well diversified portfolio. I would like to have QQQ be the largest percentage among these, is there a reason why that is a bad idea? Are there risks involved with QQQ that I have not found? Is now a bad time to get into ETFs and QQQ specifically?

n7oknc,,stocks,post,1620478206,"What's the sentiment on Facebook ($FB)I'm curious to see what the overal sentiment on Facebook is as a stock among younger investors here on reddit. Personally I despise Facebook and everything they stand for/do. I would never put my money in it eventhough the company will most likely remain to see significant growth for the foreseeable future. Plenty of big tech companies have questionable ethics to put it lightly but for most of them I can see their value to the world and society. Facebook however adds nothing, everything it touches seems to turn to shit.

Are you invested? Do you care about the practices of the company or do prioritize growth?

I'm trying to form an idea of how this stock will perform over the next 20 years when the old garde of investors starts to disappear and be replaced by the new.

Edit: it doesn't matter to me if you have your money in FB and I judge no one for their decision. We are (mostly) regular people trying to make money, if you see an opportunity you should take it. We will have little to no effect on a company be it positive or negative. So if you want to ride the wave, ride the wave.",['FB']

I still use FB as it’s a great tool for networking, especially in the music community where people post and obtain info about upcoming performances. Additionally, the video chat aspect of FB is really good too as well as the marketplace. My friends and I hardly post anything on the platform anymore because it’s become such a garbage heap of human communication. Additionally, I personally don’t use FB on my mobile devices anymore. I log in on my PC once a day, check to see what’s up, and peace out. Additionally, with the limitations being placed on tracking by Apple, I think we are going to see a further shift in the way the platform is used. If a less volatile social networking platform were to come to the forefront, I would expect that to amplify this shift.

This is especially essential as big companies have benefited the most through covid, while small and medium businesses have been wiped out.

Playing devils advocate, facebook financially supports to some degree free internet for over 500m people. Why do you hate that? Facebook also uses their profits to build new cables to create a more robust Internet, is this also despicable? 

In many countries that still don’t have unlimited Messaging or there’s a WiFi but no cell phone service, applications like fb messenger and WhatsApp can hold together communities. Especially in the developing world.

n78n3g,,stocks,post,1620420658,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

Keep your head high, stay invested, let your investments compound, just don't be saddened when your returns are at or slightly below average moving forward. You're still doing better than those that don't invest at all.",

n70krq,,stocks,post,1620399812,"Is Beyond Meat (BYND) a buy after the recent dip?**Company Description:**

Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in the United States and offers consumers a range of various plant-based meats. This company’s mission is to build meat directly from plants and have their final product consist of the same attributes as actual meat products. Beyond Meat’s products are designed to be more nutritional than that of regular meat, although the nutritional aspects of plant-based meats have been questioned. While plant-based meats may or may not be more nutritional than regular meat, by shifting to plant-based meats people can positively affect growing global issues. The issues which this company is trying to address include human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare. Their products consist of the Beyond Burger, meatballs, sausage, beef, and more. Besides certain Beyond Crumbles, all of their products are certified Kosher and Halal. As of December 2021, you can find Beyond Products available at approximately 122,000 retailer and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries. In addition, Beyond Meat has an e-commerce site which offers consumers bulk packs, mixed product bundles, and trial packs. This company is constantly innovating and their R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of the biggest food companies (Nestle, Kroger, etc.) at 7.8%. Their state-of-the-art innovation center is a 30,000 sq. foot building located in El Segundo California. This company’s mission is simple to understand, through a unique and innovative approach make the best product that gets as close as possible to real meat all while benefiting the planet.

**Total Addressable Market** (TAM)

In 2020 the plant-based meat market was estimated to be valued at $4.3 billion and is projected to reach $8.3 billion by 2025. All that growth registers a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. Much of the growth that we are witnessing is due to the growing vegan, vegetarian, and health conscious trends people are adopting. Also, many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products. All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy, but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems. While the plant-based market may not be the largest, Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry. The global meat industry is valued at $1.2 trillion and had a CAGR of 2.4% between 2015 and 2019. Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price. Beyond Meat’s Beyond Sausage sells for $10.30 a pound, that is about 70% more than regular pork sausage. One pound of factory-farmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around $3/pound, while one pound of Beyond Meat’s Beef Burger will run you around $6.25/pound. While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot, that doesn’t mean that people don’t buy Beyond Meat products. Going forward we’ll have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat market.

**Recent Developments/Acquisitions**

**The new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide (April 27, 2021) –** Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35% less fat and saturated fat, and fewer calories than 80/20 beef. This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd. It will be available in a 2-pack, the brand’s first ever value 4-pack, and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack. Dariush Ajami, the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat, said ” We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plant-based beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience. The new Beyond Burger’s rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef, and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring on-par with 80/20 ground beef burgers.” According to the University of Michigan’s 2018 Life Cycle Assessment, when compared to traditional 80/20 beef burgers, the Beyond Burger has 99% less impact on water scarcity, 93% less impact on land use, requires 46% less energy, and generates 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

**Beyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe (April 12, 2021) –** Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations. The plant-based foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49% over the last two years. In the U.K, Sainsbury’s said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide. Also, Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage. The retailers together increased Beyond Meat’s presence in 445 stores. In Germany, Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1,000 German retail stores through Kaufland, Tegut, Famila, and Real. In Austria, the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1,500 retail stores. Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores. Nearly 1,000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince. Chuck Muth, the Chief Growth Officer at the company, said “These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europe’s appetite for plant-based meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise.” Moreso, in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first co-manufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen World’s Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude Netherland.

**Beyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation (April 7, 2021) –** Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai. Ethan Brown, CEO, said “The opening of our dedicated plant-based meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meat’s ability to effectively compete in one of the world’s largest meat markets. We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth, and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.” Just a little over a year ago, Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks. In addition to Starbucks, Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Jindingxuan, GangLi Beijing, Slow Boat Brewery, Hema, METRO China and more. Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that they’ve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market, Beyond Pork.

**What could go wrong**

**Foodservice doesn’t pick up –** Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries. In the past we’ve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically, only to fall back to where it was before a few days after. Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, KFC, and a number of other restaurants. Looking at the foodservice side of their business, they’ve seen tremendous YoY growth. While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales, many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back. While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward, I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out. Impossible foods is their main competitor and they’ve partnered with the likes of Burger King, White Castle, Red Robin, and others. These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue. The questions that remain to be asked are, in the long-run, how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat? Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plant-based protein products and how many others will follow? Furthermore, Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales. There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then? Nonetheless, I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years.","['EL', 'WMT', 'KR', 'SBUX']"

In short, it seems like the entire tech sector went out of favor for the last quarter. But... if there's a turnaround in the segment, they have some good lights ahead of them. 

TL;DR - Why I'm invested in them. I really do like the company. I'm big into these guys. Maybe with GME's PC Sales push, that'll shine some light on CRSR. Maybe they'll get bought out by MSFT or AMZN who wants a more substantial play into the gaming and streaming market. Not sure, but I'm long on the stock with XXXX shares. 

**Positions**:

*  XXXX shares
* Dec 17 2021 $35C

# Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy. 

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)). 

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR. 

# Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.  

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing. Grassroots matters, but more is needed to go from early adopters to mainstream market.","['AMZN', 'PPL', 'MSFT']"

- I am bullish as fuck on Corsair but let's leave aside the financials and their recent earnings report, even though it was impressive on itself. As an avid gamer myself i can say that All pc gaming related subs are worshipping them. PCMR, one of the biggest subs in general, is filled with Corsair products. The edgy 15 year olds that frequent these subs and can't build PCs on their own or have very restrictive budget, will build computers and buy peripherals in a few years. They will also recommend parts and peripherals to less tech savvy friends and relatives. Corsair is set to thrive, they have built a cult following with the upcoming generation of gamers, something that no financial analysis can say to you unless you spend yourself many hours in gaming subs.

Also, they have shown over the years the will to expand. Remember that they started as just a memory company and they now put their name on many products. They will probably not stop here",

Consider this something of a vent and me sharing my thoughts.  I think it's a good read but hey I'm biased.*

Hey guys,

I want to share about one of the emotional issues of investing that I'm sure many of you can relate to, even if it's not talked about much around here.  I wasn't sure about sharing this, but I figured I would because I think it's important, important for me, and like I said, I imagine for others, too, even if we don't usually talk about it.

I've been investing in a Roth IRA for a few years now, but this February marked my first foray into more extensive investing.  I was sitting on a lot of cash thanks to stimulus, less consumption thanks to Covid, and other reasons, and decided now was the time to put it to work.  I got into individual stocks because of GME.  Sometimes I'm kind of ashamed to say it, because there seems to be a negative stigma attached to that, and you know what? I understand why: the meme stock thing can be anywhere from facepalm to totally cringeworthy.  I share that opinion in some ways.  But at the same time I think that moment brought a lot of young folks into the market who actually have taken the time to learn about it and get serious, and I think that's wonderful.

February 2021 was a bad time for a lot of us to get into the market, because a lot of us tried chasing performance in things like ARK funds.  I understand a lot of people got nailed.  Luckily, I was cautious about getting in tech after such a crazy bull run, and I started out quite defensively.  I haven't lost money yet.  I'm slightly up.

But man, I've rebalanced... twice now.  I mean, the initial portfolio, then a complete overhaul, followed by another complete overhaul today. There's been innumerable minor tweaks and adjustments along the way, too.  In theory, my allocations have gotten better as I've gone along.  My second portfolio definitely made more sense than my first, but after this last readjustment I'm left thinking ""what the hell did I even bother to change for?""   What I have now isn't bad, I think, but I'm not sure it's really better than what I had before.  It might even be worse.  I'll have to chew it over a bit.

That's the thing.  Honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I could just make a rule ""alright, what's done is done"", but that's not the best idea, either.  Sometimes things do change.  Sometimes there are better plays.  We learn and what not.  So I don't feel comfortable making a rule about not making any changes, and if I did make a rule, I'd probably break it anyway.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Totally clueless.  Go back to the old allocation?  Keep things as they are?  Wait and see?  I'm leaning towards wait and see.  Just get this stuff of my chest.  Ride the market a little more and keep an open mind.

It's the uncertainty that kills me, man.  Can I afford to bet a good portion of my money on the entire market (ie: VTI?)  Would it be better to hold cash right now?  What about inflation?  How about individual stocks? What if my pick underperforms or goes bankrupt?  There's always black swan events.  And what about my future?  Where will I be in 10 years?  I wish I had all the answers, but I don't.  Nobody knows.  And that can be frustrating.

One last note.  I know people are going to say ""just do index funds and be done with it"".   I already do them - that's all I have in my Roth IRA.  They're a wonderful idea; I get why people love them.  That said, the portfolio I'm talking about here is in a taxable account and it's money I may need in the mid-term.  I'm young, and my future is uncertain.  I don't know if I'm going to need to buy a house soon, or a car, or go back to school.  I have a job but the pay isn't anything to write home about, and it's not necessarily something that I'll be able to do until I retire.  I think a lot of young people can relate.

Yes, I've got my 6-12 months in cash, and I've even got a tier 2 savings fund in series I bonds (inflation protected, check 'em out).  But still.

I don't want to just sit on cash, especially since cash sucks right now.  I want to put that extra money to work, and make some returns, even if they're modest. But at the same time I don't want my whole portfolio to go crashing down 50% suddenly.  I lost the link, if someone has it please let us know, but there's this great website that shows you how your portfolio (in dollar value, not actual allocations) would have been affected in different crashes (dot com bubble, 2008, etc.)  In 2008 a portfolio would decline over 50%, IIRC, and it would take 5 years and 5 months to recover.   Great, right?  Buy and hold.  Long-term time horizon.

Yeah, that's acceptable if you're 30 years old and saving for retirement.  But for me, it's absolutely unacceptable if I need that money to put a down payment on a house in the next 3-5 years.  You see?

I wish people would be a bit more open-minded when it comes to constantly recommending index funds.  Like I said, I think they're a wonderful idea - probably the best for retirement.  But at the same time every case is different, and every market is different.  Totally wonderful to recommend them, but maybe the downvoting and criticism needs to be cut back a bit.  Dialogue would be nice.  Comprehension. Not everyone has the same goals, needs, or time horizons.  We're all learning here, and nobody has the definitive answer for anyone's financial situation, especially not for yours.

Anyway, that's all guys.  Love to hear your thoughts, feelings, and feedback.  All the best and good luck to everyone.",
n7bqw5,gxbyms9,stocks,comment,1620430347,">I don't know what to do anymore. Totally clueless.

you don't need to figure it all out today. just take a break. go read a novel or walk the dog. leave the portfolio alone for a few weeks. clear your head.

IMO investors should have a core position of something low-feethat covers the entire market or a cross section of the market. there's nothing wrong with augmenting that with some speciality/sector funds or active management or other strategies. there are many roads to heaven, to paraphrase Warren Buffett. there's research showing the most important thing is just saving money into whatever options are a available. 

In a taxable account, ETFs can have an edge over index funds/mutual funds. ETFs are usually structured to minimize capital gains. 

as a general rule, investing is for money you can leave alone for several years. 5 years is the usual guideline, because ~90% of any 5 year periods have a gain. if you'll need this money in as little as 3 years I would not invest all of it. part of it? sure. but the rest is fine in a CD, savings account. don't obsess over every last dollar needing to aggressively earn more money for you. nothing wrong with a big fat savings account. most people have $1000 or less in the bank. 

might want to look at a low-volatility ETF for the taxable account. they will have a ""beta"" lower than 1. VTI has a beta of about 1, meaning it moves exactly with the market because it IS the market. ARK funds will have beta of about 1.5 to 1.7, or 50-70% more volatile than the market. In contrast, a low-volatility ETF will have a beta of maybe .6 ... so it's LESS volatile than the market, the ups and downs will probably be less intense.  low volatility will be less prone to sharp drops in a crisis. here's one, for example, look under ""portfolio characteristics"".

With how the charts on many of the tech/growth stocks look like. It is looking like I bought all my tech stocks at their ATH many of them are now down at least 50%.  

How do I ride this out? It feels like things are going to worse. And it also isn't the easy mode my friends were talking about  they had in 2020.

The correct mentality (but it obviously doesn't sell/appeal as much) is thinking in YEARS not MONTHS. You got in February 2021, congrats. There is so much for you to learn. So many industries. So many financial instruments. Learn, learn, learn. But the truth is you've been in the stock market for only 2 months. That's nothing in stock market time. You have to start thinking in years.

Invest in companies that will be good in 3, 5, 10 years. If an investment goes down -10% in 2 months, think to yourself, does the reason I bought this stock still hold up in the long term? If yes, buy the dip or chill out because you've got confidence in the stock. If not, just sell it.

Shares outstanding decreasing!

Current assets cover current liabilities

They have taken on more debt in past year which, with low rates, may be spur the next phase of their growth

Their industry is not going away and in very high demand

Free Cash flow has gone from $12B to $21B



Negatives:

Once a dominant player, they've slipped recently and lost their lead to competition.

This market is unique to the time we are in. Speaking of Buffett, he’s made some terrible trades over the past year and a half. While random 20-something Redditors with $500 to their name have seen 10-50x returns. 

Stocks going down is normal, sure.

What isn’t normal is stock going down after crushing analysts estimates. Stocks going down after posting record breaking revenues. That is not new for small growth stocks, but for major corporations, that is new territory. 

ETSY is a good example. It sank 10% because it got downgraded by analysts this week. Then sank another 15% today because it beat analysts forecasts... but not by enough. Two years ago, if they posted the same analyst beat numbers, they pop 10% that day.

Lots of big tech have crushed analysts estimates across the board and have seen basically no movement.

But now we are seeing crazy forward earnings already being priced in.

Then we got the Fed operating like a circus. The government putting the population in a cash fan tube. Unemployment being more profitable than most hourly paid positions in the country.

I didn't want to gamble on earnings, as the price might have gone up or down 5-10%, so I just waited until their announcement. As it turns out, they beat earnings, and its price went up 5-10%. I kept waiting for its price to get a correction, but for the past week, it's literally gone up about 1-2% everyday for the last 5 days since they announced earnings.

It's now up about 10-12% from when I first wanted to buy it. It's not a tech stock and actually considered more of a ""boomer"" stock, so it might not go to the moon like a tech stock. It's still undervalued at this point, but its upside has gotten smaller after going up 10-12% already.

Its price was largely flat and boring for this year, so the 10-12% jump in price looks sort of unusual. I'm a bit worried if I buy now, it will start correcting since its price has basically just kept going up, but, then again, it might not correct since it's considered undervalued.

n6xphy,,stocks,post,1620391716,"CRWD valuation and upcoming earnings on May 31Crowdstrike is a cyber security company that provides end host security to prevent breaches and data theft. They have earnings on June 3 for Q1FY22. They posted Q4FY21 earnings on March 18, at one of the brutal red days of the Nasdaq+tech fuckfest.

Currently, CRWD is trading at December 17 levels. Lets take a look at its current valuation and try to understand its short term and long term upsides. We can also compare CRWD to NET and see where the valuations sit.

First lets look at Q4 and FY2021.

https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/8906/html

The biggest thing to note here is that CRWD is on a 100% yoy revenue trajectory. This is impressive as they've done this for 4 years straight. In FY2021, they were able to pull in $874M revenue, growth of 81% yoy. Their profit also grew 89% comparatively as they were able to drive down the costs of both their product and services increasing margin for both.

Taking into account FY21 revenue, their current P/S value is 48 (42B mktcap by 874M sales). If CRWD announces first quarter revenue of $380M, which would project it for another 80% YoY growth, then consider the stock price to go back up to $220 as we'll try to project to a P/S of 48. If CRWD earnings drop below that, I could see the stock drop to $150 at growth has slowed and the P/S would no longer justify its valuation.

Looking at their projections from their April investor relations deck:
https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/2852082c-2ce8-4d5d-96ad-0e2cb1bd8edc

CRWD is expecting to hit $3Bn ARR in 2025. As of FY2021, they are are $1Bn ARR. 

Overall, I think CRWD is fairly priced currently at $190 compared to other high performing industryplayers. I think CRWD can easily get to $220 based on speculation or if they have a good revenue Q1. I think $240 is very reasonable by end of year due to secular trends in security concerns. Their investor presentation is compelling, showing large TAM growth and tailwinds in cybersecurity. Additionally, over the next 4 years, CRWD is planning to release new products that break into new markets that increase their TAM by 2x (from 44Bn in 2021 to 106Bn in FY25). Compare this to how the market reacted when NET released their serverless platform and the stock jumped 15%. Tackling a new market creates strong tailwinds in growth.

Betting on CRWD at this current price is betting that cyber security and endpoint protection will be critical for large businesses going forward. Do you believe that corporations will see nation state and corporate sponsored cyber security attacks going forward? If so, Crowdstrike is a place you should be seriously considering putting money.

I got into CRWD at $185, but I unfortunately averaged up to a cost average of $209. Seeing CRWD at $190 feels like a fair price, and anything below $180 feels like a deal. The upside potential with regards to risk/reward feels good below $180. At around $200, it could go either way and you may just break even short term.

Long term, I think CRWD has the legs to grow 20% this year.","['NDAQ', 'IR']"

n6ynt9,,stocks,post,1620394587,"Can someone explain why selling and buying a stock/asset back at a lower cost is a stupid idea when it dips?So yes I am a new investor and I’m trying to understand this. Let’s say for example Stock X is $10. It has a good run up to  $70 over a course of 2 months and because of its high run up and RSI, you know that there will be a pull back. Let’s say now you invested 100k. This 100k has essentially 7x to 700k, but since you did not sell it at $70, it then pulled all the way back to $30 so you now have 300k. You've essentially lost out of 400k profit before tax is considered.

Why do people say it’s stupid to sell it just to rebuy it back? If you knew there would be a pull back due to the RSI, sell at $70, then rebuy the dip when it’s back at $30? Sure you pay short term capital gains but you’ve now doubled your position at the same price, assuming you reinstate all that money back into that stock. You can now increase your position, but just pay a higher average cost of $30 rather than at $10. What am I not understanding for those that hold when you know the RSI will indicate a strong dip?

An example of this would be Fubo TV, DDD, or STEM.",

n67yep,,stocks,post,1620309677,"Has tech got you down? Consider commodities, in particular, steel. For a variety of reasons:Steel manufacturing companies are set to make record profits in the next few years. Demand is up huge. [The post-COVID boom is starting.](https://www.appraisalbuzz.com/biggest-construction-boom-since-2006-best-2-weeks-for-rates-in-a-year/) The rotation out of tech is under way. And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:

-----------------------------------

**Steel prices are obscenely high**

These are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 – 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) 

And this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) 

This means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).

--------------------------------

**Inflation**

The hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation? Many expect inflation to climb regardless as there has been so much money printed. During periods of high inflation, Michael Burry thinks you want to be in [real estate and commodities](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859/photo/1). 

And even if inflation doesn’t cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.

------------------------------------

**China's rebate**

In 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world’s steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.

But now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. 

Starting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff & 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it’s getting a lot worse.

Starting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor’s product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.

Sources (you will need to translate this):

**Where in particular to invest?** 

Steel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)

There is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.

CLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will ""look after shareholders"" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.

CLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.

As people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. 

MT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade. [Commodities Boom Grips Steel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/arcelormittal-reports-best-quarter-in-decade-as-steel-joins-boom) 

And these amazing Q1 numbers don't even fully account for the new record high prices. Steel's day is just beginning. This is not a buy-today and sell-tomorrow play, this is a buy-sometime-soon and hold-for-a-long-time play.

Positions: I have shares and LEAPs in CLF and MT at a variety of strikes.","['AAPL', 'TWTR']"

To give some context, they had to do a product recall on their treadmills due to some injuries. Their treadmills represent about 2-3% of their total sales and the stock dipped about 15%. Quite honestly this seems like a massive overreaction. Don’t see a massive risk here as their bikes are the major driver of their business. Even pricing in a few lawsuits and costs related to the recall, I don’t think a 15% dip was justified. 

Basic math/logic above coupled with the fact that everyone I know who has a peloton bike is absolutely obsessed with it lead me to scoop up some shares around $83 this week. 

It’s not often you can pick up a hyper growth stock at a discount in this environment so I jumped at the opportunity.

Seeing their incredibly low churn rate on subscriptions and high engagement in their content  (26 workouts / month?!) is encouraging. Yeah, the fitness market is tough, but their secret sauce is and will be content, talent and ecosystem. The subscription model is cheap compared to a gum membership for their target market and they have plans for more hardware to attract more customers.

Biggest threat is probably Apple - they launched their own fitness content and already have strong shares in hardware and adoption.

First time poster. I have been thinking about the future of tech investments. As some background, I work in the field of competition law & regulation. Currently there are cases against Google and Facebook in the US, the latter may even lead to divestiture or total breaking up of the ecosystem.

Aside from that there is regulation on the way in the EU, the DMA and DSA will have far reaching consequences for the profitability of app stores, causing me concerns about Apple. Aside from that Amazon is under investigation as well. Aside from app stores there are also strict rules surrounding search engines. 

Right now I feel like only Amazon and Microsoft will be able to deal properly with the fallout of the changing regulatory landscape. Amazon as it is so diversified that it's a safe bet somewhat. However, I'm worried that Amazon is already so high (and public opinion of their employment terms are so bad) that there will be some inevitable fallout.

Now I'm left wondering if Microsoft is the right long-term investment. They are not overly data reliant and are building up positions in more and more areas for professional software. The only thing that concerns me is that Microsoft has a bad track record when it comes to being innovative. I fear some of their projects will ultimately fail as they are becoming perhaps the ""dinosaur"" of the tech world. 

I was wondering about your views and opinions. How likely do you think it is that new regulation or antitrust interventions will significantly harm the growth potential of these stocks? Am I missing something in my evaluation?","['FB', 'GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"

So when you buy a call option you are buying a contract with the ""Right but not the obligation"" to buy the stock at the strike price but you aren't actually buying the stock.

So IF GME went up to $805 before the expiration date the value if you sold the option the profit would not be huge, it would be it would only be a few dollars per share",

So in your example, if GME moved closer to $800 per share, the option they are holding would be come more valuable. So, they could sell that option contract and make a profit.

If it moved down, the option contract will become less valuable.

But most people who buy option contracts either let them expire worthless or sell them for a profit before expiration.",

So your 5$ option would be around $50 (looking at 11/19 gme calls) minus whatever theta from days passed, plus whatever gained in implied volatility from the stock moving from 160 to 800

*when* the stock hits 800 is very important and not included in your example.

Since februari my portfolio has been floating between -10% and -20% of my original investment and I have realised now that my lack of diversification was a big beginners mistake. I have been waiting for opportunities to sell part my positions once they break even but they have been going down for months while I tried to ""catch the falling knife"" and bought dip after dip.

A bit of context here: I’m a chartered accountant working in senior management at a real estate developer. I have experience in valuations across most asset classes (stocks / real estate / business valuations etc). 

This is the first time I have ever seen every single asset class so substantially inflated: stocks, real estate, crypto currency. Whatever it is, every asset class is at all time highs. We all know the reasons why this is the case: excessive money printing & all time low interest rates have created a yield hungry environment with inflated asset prices. 

I don’t want to waste time talking about why this is the case, but I would like to know, what are you doing to protect yourself against the eventual correction in asset prices?

n8fpef,,investing,post,1620571698,"Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",['GOOGL']

Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

So the whole idea of CET1 is that it's capital the bank's investors stand to lose.  That's usually equity, but also any earnings they're entitled to which is why retained earnings and AOCI get lumped in there.  In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize.

Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.",['CB']

n8jidy,,investing,post,1620582855,"US Equities Rug Pull ThesisThere have been posts here for the past 8 years calling for the sky to fall, but it's never happened. If you've been short US equities, you've missed out on one of the greatest bull cycles in history. BRK is even sitting on reserves of cash, so far to see no entry point. I think this dichotomy, a clear thesis for the bubble of everything along with the markets hitting new records every month, has left a lot of folks with their hands up in the air believing that the markets are just on a prolonged irrational stint.

But it seems that something far greater is brewing under the surface and the US markets will continue to see a flood of capital from the fed and globally. Every central bank in the world has printed and bought its way to negative real yields on government debt. In this race to the bottom, USD holds a special position as the global reserve currency and still holds the most trust. And yet, the USA now holds debt at 130% of GDP, the highest it's ever been.

In order to keep that debt serviceable, the fed cannot let interest rates rise. They will continue to inflate the currency, while implementing some sort of yield control to prevent a credit default. This all seems problematic, which it is, but the US is not in a vacuum. Every country's central bank is doing the same. The cracks will form on the periphery first, with defaults happening beyond the G20. As that happens, a flight to safety globally will continue to bolster US equities. Things will continue to look great for the US as the rest of the global markets reprice lower and lower.

This is all going on while the US still can only barely service its debt interest, printing more money and controlling the yield the whole time. Just when it seems like the only safe haven in the entire world is USD, is when trust will fall out of that system, popping the last bubble to fall. Markets will unwind and redistribute globally. The great rug pull will have completed.

TLDR: US Equity markets look extremely bullish in the short to mid term, but will come crashing down after the rest of the world defaults under their debt burdens.",

You realize CN and CP also use trucks. So they too would be using these electric trucks or self driving trucks.

 You also forget there is a lot of time saved going by rail rather than by road.

Rails reduce a lot of traffic on the roads, if all freight were moved by trucks the roads would be a warzone.",

n8hkut,,investing,post,1620577266,"Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

n7cmlw,,investing,post,1620431992,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returnsRecent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?",['ARKK']

n7cmlw,gxdgsdy,investing,comment,1620469016,"""now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.""

I think it's questionable that fund managers should be out there predicting their returns for the next 5 years. I can't recall another retail fund manager that has ever been in the press predicting literal % returns for the next 5 years (or 1 year for that matter.) A manager might say ""I expect a good year for tech"" if they're a tech fund or that sort of thing but I can't recall another mutual fund or ETF manager saying ""I predict X% annualized for my fund for the next 5 years."" I thought it was iffy when she did it earlier this year and now she's doing it again. So to me it's not even the math of the projections but the fact that she continues to do it in the first place.

She's really ""hyper growth all the time"" - the issue becomes it's not going always be in favor (and I think people took last year's unbelievable/once in a great while performance as confirmation/validation of hyper growth rather than possibly a ""grand finale"" - at least for a while - to cap off a decade where growth was largely the ""only game in town""), but she invests as if that's the case. Look at recently with her selling large liquid names into declines so she can buy even more of smaller, less liquid things a lot of which she already owns 10% or more of. What if she sells all the large liquid names and the decline keeps going? I wish Ark could be more dynamic in its approach - it feels like everything has to be hyper growth all the time or it's not ""on brand.""

""But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist)

She's said that there will be declines/corrections, but she doesn't invest as if that's the case and those statements are offset by her very bullish long-term predictions. ""There might be some big declines, but listen to how well this is going to do!"" I said early this year on here that the performance was not sustainable as the discussion became more and more Ark-y on here.

 Additionally, how much of the money that has poured into Ark came late? The inflows really didn't start en masse last year until in the second half of the year when the funds were already up 100% YTD. Tons of new investors started earlier this year and I'm sure a lot of them went right to Ark, chasing last year's performance.

Employed $3500 USD p/m

Objectives: Long term growth and investment / retirement

Risk tolerance: moderate

Holdings $6000 USD, no debt, $3000 USD liquidity

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.",['SPGI']

n7802u,,investing,post,1620418954,"Competition is Growing in the Telehealth SectorThe pandemic has changed a lot of things for good, including healthcare. Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

n7f2uz,,investing,post,1620440368,"Is accredited investor status something you apply for or is it a passive status? (And a couple other questions)Basically certain non-conventional or unregulated funds and investment vehicles state that they require potential investors to be “accredited investors” before being able to invest. 

I am aware of the requirements needed to be one (income level, net worth or certain qualifications). However, it is not very clear if I actually need to do something in order to get such status, or if this is something that needs to be demonstrated individually to whoever requires it.

I have also noticed sometimes all that is needed is a self-certification that I am an accredited investor (without them actually checking). Assuming someone lies that he or she is an accredited investor and proceeds with the investment, what is the legal situation here? Is it the investor who is liable? Or the company/fund for not doing due diligence? Or is there any liability at all?

Finally, does this even apply at all to non-US persons (who intend to invest in US funds/companies that are US-based and require accredited status)? Or is it just something that Americans need to be concerned about?",

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* MNST
* MPWR
* MTCH
* OLED
* PAYC
* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

\*I    am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to   ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results   and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t    understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and    henceforth. You are welcome to do whatever you like with the    information, though if you’re going to sell it that’s some pretty messed    up \*\*\*\*. Past results are no guarantee of future returns.","['IBM', 'SPGI', 'CPRT', 'INTC', 'TSLA', 'FB', 'KLAC', 'IP', 'LRCX', 'VRTX', 'MPWR', 'CHD', 'INTU', 'MKTX', 'ABMD', 'MNST', 'EXPD', 'CDNS', 'TDY', 'ISRG', 'NVDA', 'TYL', 'GRMN', 'TER', 'ANET', 'APH', 'PAYX', 'REGN', 'ACN', 'ETSY', 'AAPL', 'EW', 'TROW', 'FTNT', 'LKQ', 'ODFL', 'AMAT', 'ATVI', 'ALGN', 'ADBE', 'PHM', 'DG', 'PAYC', 'MSFT']"

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'NFLX']"

n70yxb,gxagphz,investing,comment,1620405088,"No. They will never be profitable.  The entire industry is currently subsidized by venture capital funding.  That is to say, investors in the delivery service paid $10 of your $60 food order.

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",
n70yxb,gxaakkf,investing,comment,1620402506,When automation takes over the delivery method instead of human drivers.  Not only will this eliminate wages paid to the drivers but it will eliminate tips and will reduce the delivery expense for customers.   Currently they are testing delivery robots in certain cities but these are only really feasible in dense urban areas where the delivery distance is relatively short.  Solutions for longer distances have been in the prototype phase for years which include aerial drones for at least some portion of the total distance but this will take much longer to come to market as it is dependent on FAA laws and regulations which are still being developed.,
n6dh3d,,investing,post,1620324294,"I sold every share I own today.I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner. Rant over.","['TSLA', 'TWTR', 'SPGI']"

n75u6r,,investing,post,1620413353,"Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls ShockGold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.","['PM', 'ED']"

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

n6l995,,investing,post,1620344980,"The Roaring 2020s (Economy/Stocks)So.

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Conclusion. Get in losers, were doing the roaring 2020s. And they are mad that the poors have a better chance of capturing income in this decade.",

n7pr3w,,investing,post,1620482197,"Do individual stocks have their own 'personality'?Hi,

I've noticed that a good number of serious, professional and semi-professional intraday and swing traders focus on a couple of dozen stocks. My question is, do stocks have their own unique personalities, and if they do, what are the best ways to learn what they are?

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

Thanks,

I remember there used to be something called the “superbowl” indicator where someone figured out that if a team from the old AFL won the superbowl it predicted with 90% accuracy what the stock market would do that year.  Of course it eventually stopped working so well because it was just the human brain trying to fit a pattern to random historical data.  The other thing is that even when there is a consistent pattern, if the pattern is detected by enough traders, the form of the pattern will be changed by their trading.  For example, suppose a stock always went up on Thursday morning.  Traders would start buying like crazy on Wednesday afternoon in anticipation, which would make the stock go up Wednesday afternoon instead of Thursday morning.",['AFL']

n6fysa,,investing,post,1620330775,"In just 3 months, Tesla has issued 80% of the shares ARK's valuation model projected they would issue through 2025.Their model is beyond amateurish.  Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

n6klu0,,investing,post,1620343064,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero.

I recommend low-cost indexing to anyone who asks in my personal life, so I definitely support the broader argument here. Further, there are entire subreddits dedicated to [obvious scams](https://old.reddit.com/r/NKLA/) and other pump-and-dumps so there's clearly a need for this type of analysis.

On the other hand, it's so alien to my experience that it comes off to me as unpersuasive. I've probably held 50+ individual stocks in my life and none of them went defunct. Even broadening it to every company I've put on a watchlist, that number is still zero out of 200+ companies. The few delisted were products of M&A, and generally profitable for shareholders.

This article itself shows the numbers are vastly different for large companies, where 77% of the top 1000 companies by market cap made positive returns and just 7% are gone.  Further there's the minefield of Biotech stocks which decay steadily to zero unless they develop a profitable drug. [18 of the 32](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_stocksonly,ta_perf_52w75u&ft=3&o=industry) stocks down 75% over the last year come from this one industry - two more are generic drug developers.

Finally, even if stocks were exactly the unavoidable minefield described in this article, it's not a mathematically persuasive argument against active investing. After all, an active strategy could also include direct indexing where an investor owns merely *most* of an index. If owning just a few stocks is bad, then owning all but a few has to be the mirror image, right? You're effectively indexing + shorting a bad active strategy.",

n6rgw5,,investing,post,1620366351,"Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500Hi,

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","['SPGI', 'TSLA', 'NFLX', 'ADBE', 'NVDA', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"

It's 150%, actually.

>Through which business segment?

Ads. Their ad revenue growth was 77% YoY for the last quarter and it doesn't really have costs.

>Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.

I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.

* Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously [cash-heavy](https://merchantmachine.co.uk/most-reliant-on-cash/) countries.
* After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.

> AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.

* There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.
* Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.
* The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend)).

Taking the points above into account, we probably won't see a massive decline in AWS growth for a while.","['GOOGL', 'AMZN']"

n6822k,,investing,post,1620309974,"What Are Your PPE Manufacturer Plays? Tech earnings are receiving all the hype recently, and if you guys are like me, you’re looking for stocks to get into at low prices, and ride out the growth (we’re all aiming for the next TSLA). While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.","['TSLA', 'MMM']"

His comments on leaving money to his wife in the SP500 instead of Berkshire seem interesting to me. I imagine most of his money is currently in Berkshire. He nearly always says that he thinks Berkshire is amazing and that index funds are great for most people. If he believed in Berkshire's future once he and Charlie are no longer at the helm, wouldn't it make more sense to leave her the money within Berkshire?

Based on this, does it make sense to invest in Berkshire for the long term based on his comments versus an index fund?

Edit: fixed some grammar and framing to be more clear",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['KO', 'SPGI', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx62vky,investing,comment,1620319497,"I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN']"

Now you talk about valuing a company, FCF and market ratios in the same sentence, but market ratios refer to what the market values a company at, and that is already reflected in the stock price (pricing).

So do you want to price your company or value it (intrinsic value)? And to me it sounds like you want somebody else to do that for you (asking for a tool), but keep in mind that valuations reflect personal projections and can vary heavily based on whoever or whatever valued it.

Generally a good way to value a growth stock at first glance is looking at the market cap and then looking at the revenues they bring in and seeing what the annual growth rate is for that revenue year over year. That is how you get the price to sales and assess if the growth rate justifies the valuation it is trading at. Then I would look into earnings and financial statements to see how the path to profitability could play out and what their debt to equity is and how much cash they are burning. Of course you should do a much deeper dive and look at their quarterly statements, look at their management and leadership, and the fundamental aspects of the business.

n6bpu8,,investing,post,1620319669,"Valuing a startup: Can someone suggest a case study to model against?I'm  looking at a stock that is in its early stages.  There is small revenue, but it just begun growing.  The question how to measure  potential revenue in the next 5 years, and try to estimate reasonable  growth expectations, so I can come up with reasonable valuation.  Was  wandering if anyone came across a case study, or earnings projection  report that is well written and has proven accurate that I can model  against?

\-I believe a report like  that should cover some way to measure demand.  Which maybe part of the  market and if that market is growing.  
\- Maybe a comparable to analyze its growth against another company either in the same or adjacent segment.

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

n62yvd,gx4ptgu,investing,comment,1620292253,"Personally I have always believed the buy price is very important for achieving solid long term results. E.g. buying a company that grows 10% a year at half price over time would give you almost the same amount of gain as investing in a company the grows 20% a year at full price, assuming market valuation appreciates to fair value. Of course a 20% growing company would have a much higher valuation, but a 10% annual gain compounded by a 100% appreciation to fair value would give you very decent returns.

n5yd5o,,investing,post,1620272502,"Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?Hi r/investing,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

Since I am new to value investing, am I missing something here? Or, is this a good pick to buy-and-hold?","['PEG', 'TSLA']"
n5yd5o,gx5iiqs,investing,comment,1620310822,"Approving the comment but with some guidance:  Even though the stock is undervalued, I encourage you to come to the table with a more thorough analysis.  A thorough discussion of valuation is going to do more than look at various ratios of earnings.  For example:

1. What's the FCF-based fair value?
2. What's the delta of Ford's forward P/E in each of the past five quarters to its actual P/E?  In other words, how much did positive earnings materialize into stock price appreciation?
3. What is the historical and forward P/E comparison to Ford's peers?  The automotive industry is exceptionally capital intensive with not staggeringly high margins.
4. What are the risk factors unique to the automotive industry?  Investors have been as shy of automotive stocks as they have been of airline stocks, two industries that required a LOT of public subsidy over the past five decades, and are now facing a transformation challenge: spurred on by the $2 billion settlement of VW AG over its emissions scandals, automotive makers have an incentive to convert their production to EV's but at what cost?  Is Ford ahead or behind its peers in this regard?
5. There's not a lot in their financial statements that looks glaringly bad (some commentary on non cash items, discontinued operations and capital lease obligations is welcome but not materially significant) but a few things should be at least commented on including that three of the past five quarters they posted a net operating loss... Granted, that owes to the pandemic but when we look at history, even before the pandemic the stock price never rose above $14 per share and hovered for quite a while around $10, currently trading at $11.5399.  So the market's not really moved the price even remotely close to the FCF fair value in the last half decade... What implications might that have for the expected return?  That may or may not matter depending on the type of value investor you're pitching the question to, but it's got to be addressed so they can weigh it.

There are, I'm sure, many other questions that can be raised if given more than the five or six minutes I glanced at the company's data... This is just an example of the kind of questions you should anticipate.",

n5v0cr,,investing,post,1620261362,"Teladoc Stock is Down Another 8% This Week. Don’t Just Blame Poor Earnings.""The stock has been under pressure for the past few months since the firm signaled that it [expects little membership growth in 2021](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teladoc-stock-falls-on-downbeat-forecast-for-membership-51614267007?mod=article_inline). A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

n5w1a9,,investing,post,1620264703,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DDVista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",

n5lead,,investing,post,1620235477,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor  
**Resolution 2:** I made 3 copies of the sheet in hopes of spreading out the odds of getting in

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

n5jbxh,,investing,post,1620230375,"Limiting turnover in levered portfoliosAfter spending a bit too much time reading  ~~papers~~ marketing pieces from AQR, I'm fully convinced that a ""balanced portfolio"" (ie less stocks, more bonds and alts than the 100/0) levered up to the risk of stocks should beat the pants off everyone's favourite 100/0 while cutting the tails somewhat, even with realistic financing costs and transaction costs  (cursory look at Alpha Architect's ~~material~~ sales pitches for high turnover products)

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

Or am I missing something else entirely?",['ES']

n5jbxh,gx1mkfe,investing,comment,1620233029,"If you buy ETFs financed with margin or box spreads, you could realize losses to prevent the leverage ratio increasing over your target. I know you said you did not want to realize losses, but you could use the losses to realize gains (and step up your bases) by selling and buying similar but not equivalent ETFs to make sure those losses are not wasted.

Now might not be the best time to start a leveraged portfolio combining stocks+bonds. The portfolio works best when stocks and bonds are negatively correlated - we have flight to safety to bonds when stocks drop, we have a Fed dropping rates when things are scary, and we have minimal inflation (which may cause stocks and bonds to be positively correlated). Right now inflation may be a risk and the Fed may not have room to drop rates any lower. Any thoughts on this?

n5bh4l,gx248qb,investing,comment,1620240413,"- 21 years old, live in the US
- Currently a student, but make ~$4k in passive income per month from a small business and entering an internship in IB ($16k for the Summer, ~$120k starting if I get a FT offer)
- Would love to think about saving for retirement early. I contributed $28k to a profit sharing Keogh this this past year, and will have ~$30k in savings post-tax in a checking account.
- Want to retire before 50 if possible
- Risk tolerance is pretty high given the time horizon, but not opposed to safer options
- None of the $28k is invested right now
- No debt

How should I invest my $28k??",

Just sold 1.8 ETH and regained my Initial Investment while still having 1.2 ETH still in the game. I'm a Bogleheads Investor with 70% VTI, 20% VXUS and 10% BND. In recouping my initial investment, I'll spread it across my 3 Index Funds in the same %'s.

Now with the 1.2 ETH, would you just let it ride?

I'm in a fortunate position to be playing with House Money. At zero cost to me, I can let it ride and see if it Moons in 1, 5, 10, 20 years. Or, I could pull it out now and put the $4k value of ETH into my Bogleheads Index Fund portfolio. I'm 38 years old and investing for retirement.

Thanks in advance for your feedback!",

n4m397,,investing,post,1620128014,"Persistent high inflation won't happenThe Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

Assumptions:

* There is one intergalactic market that contains *everything* of value
* The market includes a risk-free asset (though I don't believe this is truly a requirement for this conclusion)
* I can buy an infinitesimal amount of anything and everything in the market
* Everyone knows everything about everything in the market, and they've traded with such liquidity that the value of everything in the market has been determined exactly
* The market portfolio is the sum of everything in the market
* We're in a frictionless vacuum, and cows are spherical

Then, the market portfolio is the best mean/variance portfolio: if a higher Sharpe ratio portfolio existed, then *everyone* would recognize this and use it, changing the prices in the market, making the portfolio worse than or equivalent to the market portfolio.

And if I wanted to invest in the market portfolio, I would buy a fractional share of the market, the components of which would then be weighted by their value in the market (their market capitalization)

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?

I'm currently a 26 y/o engineer based in the Bay Area with a $160k salary. I currently have about 250k saved among my 401k (\~82k), Roth IRA (\~13k), and Brokerage account (\~155k). My 401k is all in on FXIAX, and my IRA is all in on VTSAX. My Brokerage is split 80% VTSAX, 20% VTIAX, and I'm consistently adding about 3k per month at this split to my account. My goal is to eventually buy a home in the Bay Area, which can be very expensive. Not sure when I'd like to make such a purchase, but I'm thinking within the next 5 years. I would also like to retire early if possible (no set age in mind).

My question is, is my current approach of going all in index funds going to help me buy that house in the coming years (and potentially retire early)? I'm wondering if I should look into investing something with potentially more payout, but more risk, such as crypto.",

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?","['SPGI', 'DHR', 'DIS', 'UNP', 'TSLA', 'UNH', 'NFLX', 'TGT', 'NKE', 'HD', 'ADBE', 'TMO', 'HON', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['INTC', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'IP', 'AMD']"

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

n3tkix,,investing,post,1620040800,"Bullish or bearish on China / FLCH?I own some FLCH, which has some 900 holdings and a quarter of the ETF is Alibaba and Tencent, however the ETF value has been stagnating. I am considering liquidating and putting my money into VTI to ride thIs wave. But this is my dilemma:

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful. I obviously regret not putting that money into VTI as my logic (at the time) was that the global recovery will be lead by China:,and since China is the biggest trading partner for some 130+ countries, the ETF will recover nicely.

Now, with political tensions (delisting included) and increasing risks of a new cold war, I'm thinking it may stagnate for the next year or so while VTI climbs. But knowing my luck I suspect that if I do so, VTI will then slow down (stimuli already priced-in) and FLCH will take off.

n3jkda,,investing,post,1620000972,"Retail Dragon Portfolio - Week 1 UpdateFirst weekly update on the Retail Dragon Portfolio. A new screenshot can be found [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jSahhfA).

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Chris Cole's Dragon Portfolio Allocations](https://imgur.com/gallery/0JVrDkm)
* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI']

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

The Biden executive order has directed the DOJ to cease use of private facilities which is acting as a headwind to revenue and contract renewal rates. Losing the Bureau of Prison business via the executive order isn't that big of a deal, but it does represent ~$290MM of revenue rolling off between now and FYE2022. More concerning, however, was having the contract with the US Marshals canceled at the GEO Queens facility as this customer was viewed as far more sticky than the BOP. Losing the BOP revenue was always a matter of ""when"", not ""if"", but potentially losing the USMS in addition means GEO investors need to diligence how the company will navigate losing two of its top three customers.

Increasing chatter of reform at ICE layers in additional concerns as this is their largest customer, though it isn't clear to me how the USMS and ICE will rapidly move away from the industry with any degree of efficiency, particularly as COVID impacts on prison and ICE populations abate. While the asset value at GEO is robust, keep in mind there is limited use for these assets. A prison can't be converted into a shopping mall or a bowling alley, for example, and at GEO you have a lot of debt ahead the equity that would be paid out first in the event of a liquidation. While it likely makes sense for the government to solve the prison prison ""problem"" by buying these assets for public use given the constraints in the government prison system, for political reasons this may not happen.

Add on top of all of this is GEO's limited ability to tap capital markets due to ESG concerns (though this is a constantly moving line) + GEO's 2024 maturity wall and it doesn't strike me as a great equity story. Limited paths for growth, regulatory concerns, questionable access to capital, refi risk, etc, etc. Eliminating the dividend was a good first step but long over due. Given yield on GEO's debt I would prefer to buy the near term bonds than the equity.

Personally I like CoreCivic better than GEO. Less leverage, better story, less BOP risk, but neither strikes me as a compelling equity opportunity.

TLDR: tough equity story; this is not a ""down the fairway"" stock as it is borderline distressed; lots of revenue is rolling off and even more is at risk of rolling off in the future rendering current P/E metrics rather useless; limited opportunities for growth in general as prison populations have been in decline for years now",['ICE']

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile. 

Is it not commonplace to view growth stocks as more volatile than value? Was this view different 15 years ago?",['BLL']

However, I’m not even sure your statement holds today, as we can easily flip it. We say we view growth as more risky, but how many people are throwing large investments into renewables or EVs?  The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth. 

People tend to extrapolate recent past performance into the future and view recent decline to indicate continuing decline and recent success to indicate continuing success.",

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary.

Why not!? If you think inflation is going to keep climbing I don't see how the 30 year yield can remain low. 3% doesn't even represent a normal level of term spread even at low inflation levels. If inflation remains stable or continues to increase the 30 year yield has to continue going up just to maintain a positive expected return much less keep up with historical term spread.",

Well Powell keeps saying transitory rather than temporary because temporary implies it does away. Transitory means it is a one time bump. Once inflated the Fed and the treasury do not expect a decline in prices but lower future inflation.

I've been in gold and silver since last spring/summer. I don't think it will rise that much due to alternatives like crypto (which I sadly did not buy into last spring/summer), the strength of equities, and how bullish economies coming out of a recession tend for boom industrial materials/metals rather than defensive ones like silver/gold. Not saying it can't rise on inflation, but gold/silver are highly speculative so a strong global economy could offset the inflationary gains of precious metals.",

Either the valuation methods were good to use and it’s just that the type of company that wins the future has so much higher margins and network effects that the definition of key value metrics has to change, OR (like many here seem to suggest), somehow this will all “regress to the mean” and somehow Sysco, public enterprise group, and Cincinnati Financial (great companies I also own) will eventually outperform the other ones I mention?

n2fchi,gwj4qzf,investing,comment,1619869196,"Someone said this in 2011 about John Hussman: ""**Conflating his views of what should happen with what could happen.** He is the anti-David Tepper, **more concerned with the the violated rules of the game than with winning the game itself**."" (https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/The-Reformed-Broker/2011/0112/Mutual-fund-manager-apologizes-kind-of) This was in 2011 after Hussman spent the prior couple of years fighting the Fed and talking about how everything was a bubble. He then spent nearly the next 10 years fighting the fed (to the point of doing a petition against what the Fed was doing - in 2020: https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/john-hussman-is-literally-fighting-the-fed/a1376170) 

I think there are people who view growth with some degree of disdain, have this belief that ""anything above (fill in random low # p/e) is bubble/overvalued/etc"" and then they get upset/frustrated when those names go up for years on end (remaining too focused on all the reasons why they shouldn't and meanwhile, not focused on why they could and did.) For all their dislike and disinterest in investing in growth, they still manage to seem to be consistent and eager spectators and have an opinion on all the most popular names. 

If you are a ""value investor"" (unless you run a value fund, I don't know why you feel you have to strictly be a ""value investor"") it's been a frustrating decade topped off with the fact that in a pandemic aggressive growth had probably its best year since the dot com era, outperforming value (which one would have thought would have provided shelter from the storm, yet underperformed in the initial decline in March 2020 and then massively underperformed in the months after.)

That said, growth can absolutely become very frothy and I think did last year - it was completely a year of ""the more aggressive the growth story the better."" The kind of performance that aggressive growth had last year was in no way sustainable unless ""this time is very different."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly)

 Ultra low rates and an eagerness to chase anything ""disruptive"" lead to a year that probably won't be repeated any time soon. People invested in EVs like all the companies were going to be winners (https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html), despite the fact that the automobile industry has a very, very, very (very) long list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) of losers in its history. People were investing in shroom stocks as if shrooms were going to be in every produce section tomorrow. Battery company that wasn't going to have a product until 2025 bought up...until reality hits (and then on top of that it's called a fraud.) I think people get overly excited about a theme and then it's buy anything related at any price. Might still actually be a good long-term theme but where you bought it still matters: if you buy into short-term mania, you could still be a bagholder for a while when reality returns. 

The Ark ""collect 'em all"" posts got excessive and people calling Cathy Wood ""Money Tree"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree) might have been the top before the correction in Feb in Ark-y aggressive growth. Many growth names corrected significantly or very significantly in Feb-Mar, and it's interesting to see what's bounced and what has not as perhaps people have become more selective. If you see another ramp higher in rates, growth will pull back again. Will ""growth collapse""? I don't think so. Will nonsense eventually crater and excess cool off? Yes. Not everything in growth is in some sort of massive, speculative excess, although people like to paint it that way.

If you're still positioned for what did exceedingly well in 2020, you're probably not going to do as well in 2021. I don't think that things are going back to 2019 normal - covid seems as if it will be endemic so I think people have to invest in this sort of ""in-between"" where it's not the worst of the pandemic but a return to 2019 or close to it might be a long ways off. I think people should consider having a portion of their portfolio dedicated to a selected group of aggressive growth names they feel strongest about and a portion dedicated to higher quality - not necessarily boring/conservative, but slower, high quality growth that has demonstrated consistent results over the years. Real assets/inflation beneficiaries should also be considered.

This isn't ""anti-value"", although I think traditional value investing I think is very difficult in a world that seems to be increasingly focused on ""why is my stock down 1% in the last hour?!?!"", it's more: understand your strengths, don't create a lot of arbitrary rules (""Anything with p/e above 15 is too expensive"") - have some flexibility and give yourself a broad mandate so that you can be able to look for the broadest set of potential opportunities.",
n2fchi,gwj284p,investing,comment,1619867072,"Fun fact: Monster Beverage (MNST) has gone up over 60,000% since its public debut in 2003, surpassing all other stocks in the S&P 500. 

Fun fact: Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) outperformed Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon over the past decade.

High valuations *are* a good reason to expect lower future returns. Over the past decade, AAPL and MSFT have delivered excellent returns, but a significant part of those returns came from multiple expansion. That’s unlikely to repeat, and if interest rates rise, multiples will contract significantly. 

A decade ago, AAPL and MSFT *were* value stocks. People considered AAPL’s business model to be heavily reliant on the iPhone and it sold at a low P/E typical of a hardware manufacturer. MSFT was considered a dinosaur. Few were bullish on them like they are now.

Growth companies, *provided they’re purchased at a sensible price*, can absolutely deliver high returns. But as a group, historically, high multiple stocks do not outperform low multiple stocks over long periods of time. The reason: high expectations of continued growth and a lack of appreciation of competition.","['SPGI', 'MNST', 'FB', 'DPZ', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"
n2fchi,gwizt71,investing,comment,1619864823,It is extremely difficult to point out from which part of the system the next crisis will emerge. I think that we can not know at this stage but that we can only argue that valuations are now relatively high.,
n2fchi,gwj3yc7,investing,comment,1619868544,"I'm not going to claim to be any sort of expert on this topic and I'm not going to disagree with your main observation, but I'll give my two cents on the perceptions of the two strategies.

1) Trends and market darlings die hard. So even if a company is overvalued, the most important aspect is that the brand is recognizable and so people are going to invest or do business with it. That means that if you buy in there is very likely to still be upswing left even if the company is somehow making all the wrong management decisions. So growth works even if you're late to the bandwagon.

2) Picking a value stock is like picking a favorite horse or home nfl draft dream team. Sure, on paper, everything may be perfectly aligned, but (repeat after me) the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. And sure P/E ratios and long views help, but you're still ultimately gambling that the crowd will eventually come to the same conclusion that you did to see any really strong uplift. And frankly, it's just hard to pick diamonds in the rough.

3) Look at any growth vs value comparison chart of the last 20 or so years and yes growth outperforms value, but they both track each other pretty well in the up markets. It's in the brief downturns where you see values greatly outperform growth, which again, I think is a logical outcome since everyone is panicking. So even though it wins the minority of the time, it wins when everyone is freaking out and so it gets this reputation as tried and true, default advice.",
n1z80f,,investing,post,1619804740,"This Barron's article might explain Tesla's sudden surge today: Tesla Stock Turns Higher Because Sales and Deliveries May Blow Away Estimates[https://www.barrons.com/articles/earnings-lift-restaurant-brands-its-ceo-says-its-a-post-pandemic-growth-story-51619801175](https://www.barrons.com/articles/earnings-lift-restaurant-brands-its-ceo-says-its-a-post-pandemic-growth-story-51619801175)  


A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['TSLA', 'TWTR', 'SPGI', 'DOW']"

n2uok0,,investing,post,1619913292,"İnflation nothing changedNothing has changed over the past week. The Fed remains dovish, and in spite of its transitory speak about inflation, prices continue to soar. Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

I wish I had more to say , but who wants to hear a running post on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, and given the long slow grind lower following the slingshot to 2100 in Goldand 40 silver , I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",

This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/kactomp8f4y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6c1d86da25f65e45c413ddbda1525e1641f3d4

GME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/uehk0zqbf4y61.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b72059fbded021f4d9af34cfcf7f8f6076aa419

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. 

  
**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank.

  
**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment.

  
**Sos($SOS)** stock experienced a significant rally and then a drop this week after reporting more than 300% revenue growth. The major cause for concern here is that 84% of their revenue came from a single customer.

  
**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report.

  
**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

n8epd3,,StockMarket,post,1620568541,"DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports BettingOne lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1. Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.
2. The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","['DE', 'SBUX']"

n8ip85,,StockMarket,post,1620580525,"Did a major shakeup to my Growth Portfolio. Thoughts?This is my taxable growth portfolio across a couple of brokerages. My goal is to get 18%-20% avg annual returns over 10 years. I have other portfolios that are more conservative and also retirement accounts that I am not factoring in here.

I **used to have** several SPACs (VIH, HOL, SFTW, NSTB, CLOV) and other speculative positions (DRRX, PCTI, SKLZZ, RBLX) in this portfolio and as a result, I incurred \~18%+ loss in the last 3 months. Overall I am still in green from the total capital I have invested, but the last 3 months erased a large portion of my gains from last year. 

I aggressively trimmed my speculative positions and added MSFT, AAPL, and doubled down on some of my high conviction names, even though those are still risky (MP, PLTR, COIN). 

The concern I have is confirmation bias, so I would like your perspective on what names I should still consider adding or changing to get this whole portfolio to grow 18-20% annually. 

This portfolio still has IPOD and IPOF and with it being near NAV, I am still thinking to just keep it in case one of them turns out to be a winner. 

I don't have any genome/biotech names here. Should I consider those? Or should I add names like FB, TSLA? Or double down more on some of these?

Every month I am adding a good amount to this. Not showing the total portfolio value to avoid sending any wrong message.

Despite this, it’s on track to breaking one dollar when it was only a few cents several months ago.

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
> The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&P technology sector.
*****
> The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
> The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
> “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
> Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
> The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
> Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
> The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
> Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
> “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
> # Tech battleground
> The S&P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
> In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
> Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
> The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
> Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
> “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
> “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
> Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
> “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
> Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
> “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
> Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

> # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

> After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

> As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

> While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

> While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

> In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETF's (ARKK) holdings, we created a custom portfolio that members can add here. Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKK's holdings as of 5/6/21.

> As always, investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities, and this chart analysis is in no way meant to be a buy or sell recommendation.

> # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

> As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

> Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

> To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

> # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

> Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

> Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

> “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

> Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

> # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

> One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

> With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

> Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

> “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&P 500 Index earnings growth.

> So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

> # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

> The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

> Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

> The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

n7l183,,StockMarket,post,1620463914,"Nine tips for reading Annual Reports by an Accountant 

Nine tips for reading Annual Reports from an Accountant. Annual reports often run into 100's of pages. Here is what you need to know.

Thread 🧵⬇️

**1. Read Back to Front.**

Miss the glossy marketing pages and skip straight to the numbers. Before reading what the managers say about how well they have done, it is a good idea to have formed our own opinion.

**2. Focus on Profit**

There are so many ways profit is calculated the directors can be talking about a completely different number to the one considered most relevant.

Check the profit adjustment items under

* Exceptional
* Non-recurring
* One-off

Decide if they should be included.

**3. Even Better Focus on Free Cashflow Over Profits**

The best investors don’t spend huge amounts of time looking at a company’s profits. Instead, they spend a lot of time looking at its free cash flow in order to work out how good or bad a company’s shares might be as an investment

What is free cash flow? In layman’s terms it is the amount of cash that a company has leftover every year to pay its lenders and shareholders. It is essentially a company’s cash profits. Or essentially the cash which can be extracted from the company, whilst the company still maintaining its current growth.

**A sign of a company with high-quality profits is that it turns a large proportion of its profits into free cash flow**

**4. Check the Segmental Report.**

When a company is changing shape, using cash flow from one division with limited prospects to build up another which will diversify and grow its revenue. The Segmental report highlights this.

**5. Check the Remuneration Report.**

This is where executive pay is disclosed. Excessive pay counts against a company in my evaluations. It can mean the board is more interested in filling its own pockets than rewarding employees and shareholders fairly.

**6. Don't Overlook the Risk Section.**

Companies do not like to talk about why they might lose money, which is what makes this section so compelling. Companies spell out the commercial challenges they face, and also present convincing arguments as to why they might overcome them.

**7. How does it make money?**

Read the business model section. A business model is how a company makes money. A strategy is how it plans to make more. To be credible, strategies must make sense, and they must be reflected in the results of the company.

**8. Skip the Chairman Notes**

Read the CFO notes. The chief financial officer will often repeat what the chief executive and chairman say but add more commentary on the numbers and how they were derived.

**9. Check Accounting Treatments**

Auditor’s report

Auditors very rarely qualify their opinion on the financial statements, but it can be useful to note which areas of accounting they focused their investigation on.

If you enjoyed this then maybe I can tempt you with my Twitter page [/\_JosephWilks](https://twitter.com/_JosephWilks) where I write daily insights on long-term investing like this.",['TWTR']
n7l183,gxdnukg,StockMarket,comment,1620475142,"To build on this, Footnote 1 will typically disclose significant accounting policies, so how the company treats and disclose different areas of the business. Its light on the numbers, but packed with high level info.

FiHi (financial highlights), is also always a good one to look at. The auditors always put a lot of effort into this section to ensure it’s complete and accurate. Some more good quick hitting info on a per share basis in this section.

The other footnotes I’ll read moreso on an as needed basis. If a number looks high or odd in one of the actual financial statements, I’ll try to look toward the corresponding footnote, or sub events footnote to try to figure out what is driving the activity.

CPA here who has only worked in audit, so I probably view the annual and quarterly reports from a different lense.",

It’s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF’s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden.
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report.


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I’m good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car!

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you’re bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. 

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I’m sure you’ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that’s why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that’s some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn’t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery’s and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he’s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216.

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you’re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don’t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.

n8iu7s,,StockMarket,post,1620580918,"Need help with understanding stock market basics. Is it a good idea to buy stocks that have been heavily shorted?I have been following along with the news and many hype videos for GME and AMC made by people with much deeper understanding of the market than I have. It seems to follow a logical pattern based on the contract nature of shorting the particular stock. Hedge Funds borrow tons of stocks, resell the stocks flooding the market with sell orders, this drives the price down until it's time to buy them back up to give back to original lender. When buying back up the price jumps back up because supply and demand mechanics. This seems especially true for the gme and amc situation due to popularity and widespread coverage making a massive amount of people aware of the short.

So my question is, assuming I understand the above correctly, is it generally a good idea to buy stocks that have been heavily shorted? I'm assuming the pattern plays out and when the contract is about to close the stock will rise again. So buying the bottom of the dip will lead to good profits later. 

Am I understanding the concept correctly?",

If all is accurate this is what I found.

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They   just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led   by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of   his own money
3. Completed   the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the   company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

After those two things are secure, I’d start investing. Until you know how everything truly works, I’d just go with a S&P 500 index fund like VOO or SWPPX. It tracks the companies in the S&P 500. Historically it returns around 9% annually over time.

The reason to have the debt paid off and emergency fund is because investing is long-term. If the market drops temporarily, you won’t want to have to take your money out to pay for rent or something.

(A lot of people here hate Robinhood for some shenanigans, but hey, if you're new, it's a good way to make some trades without paying really heavy fees. There's some cleverly hidden costs, but no large fees.) It doesn't really matter. Use a broker you're comfy with. It sounds like you're being smart by asking questions, starting light and low risk and being willing to learn. There are plenty of resources online.

New appointed BOD member Chuck Hastings, CEO of Riley Wealth Mgmnt (Nasdaq: RILY). More major news imminent! PPS up @100% since first DD. Significant upside remains!  

Ive been super busy and haven’t chance to provide this update…

**Updated EBITDA 2021 estimate with ETH at $3500 is $55,160,000. Current Market cap is $16,384,786.**

My first extensive DD post for APLD (PPS $.92-$1.40, ETH @ $2200) link below. Current PPS approx. $1.80

APLD is a sole Ethereum Mining company. Here’s a quick recap…

&#x200B;

* Creates pure play publicly traded Ethereum mining company
* Strategic Partnership with SparkPool (the largest Ethereum mining pool in the world) and GMR will enable APLD to scale quickly with industry leading efficiency
* SparkPool and GMR each take a  9.9% equity stake in APLD and have executed a three-year services agreement with one year auto renewals
* Strong institutional backing with $16.5 million private placement
* Expects initial mining capacity to come online in May 2021
* Goal is to scale mining quickly and then expand into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-fungible tokens      (NFTs)
* The Company plans to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market as soon as possible

Link to my first DD post…

[DD: OTC MicroCap Gem. Low Float.New ETH Miner trading near/at 1x 2021 EBITDA. New Partnerships & SRVC Agreement w/Sparkpool and GMR. PPS Run just getting started...Applied Blockchain (APLD). : SpecStocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecStocks/comments/my87ps/dd_otc_microcap_gem_low_floatnew_eth_miner/)

Since my first post, the price of Ethereum has increased to $3500-$3750 from $2300ish, significantly changing the forecasted Revenue/EBITDA for 2021 and beyond (see below). This is keeping APLD a great value despite the 100% increase in PPS since my first post. IMO, ETH bull run has just gotten started. Ethereum network is the foundation for block chain. 

This is stock is still so under the radar!! But IMO that’s very close to changing. Here’s why…

1.PR is due out any day regarding the receipt and installation of their first $5m worth of mining rigs. This news will have significantly positive effect on their PPS. It will eliminate any doubts to going live with their mining rigs, etc. With the low float and typically low volume its best to buy before the news comes out.

2.APLD appointed Chuck Hastings to their board of directors. Chuck Hastings currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of B. Riley Wealth Management, a subsidiary of B. Riley Financial (Nasdaq: RILY).

“Chuck is a recognized leader in the financial industry with more than two decades of global financial and business expertise that will be of tremendous value as we pursue opportunities to leverage our initial investment and further scale our mining operations""

However with the demand for construction sky rocketing. One can only speculate, it won’t be anytime soon. This is largely due to COVID restrictions being lifted as well as Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Now let’s focus a little on the infrastructure bill aspect. There’s a lot of speculation which companies will benefit the most from this. Though trying to pinpoint who’ll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let’s focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains. They’re gonna need a lot of supplies for the job. That’s where TEX the glorious Terex shines.

n7nbg3,,StockMarket,post,1620473509,"Bull Call Spread Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m continuing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Bull Call Spread option strategy

A Bull Call spread is a bullish strategy that is set up by buying a call option of a lower strike price while simultaneously selling a call option of a higher strike price, both being in the same expiration cycle. Take a look at the example below to see how a bull call spread looks like.

 Stock AAA is trading for $45

* Jan 18/21 Long 50 call – $1.50
* Jan 18/21 Short 53 call- $0.60

This comes out to a Net Debit of $0.90. Net debit is the total difference between what you pay and what you receive for all options in a strategy. Since a Call Debit Spread consists of 2 options, the net debit is just the difference between the premium of the long call and short call. These 2 things Net debit and Net Credit are crucial to understand as you will come across these terms frequently. 
 
For premium buying strategies, the net debit will be equivalent to max loss, the maximum amount you can lose from this trade. Meanwhile, Your maximum profit is the width of the strikes of the spread (53-50), minus the net debit. 
3-0.90= 2.10/$210. This will be the maximum amount you stand to make from this trade.

**Max profit** 

As long as the stock trades at or above the short call strike (53) at expiration, max profit is attained.  

**Max loss**

As long as the stock trades at or below the long call at expiration which is 50 in this case, you will lose the net debit paid/max loss which is $0.90 in this case

**Breakeven**

The breakeven point is found by taking the long call + net debit. If the stock trades at breakeven point at expiration, you will breakeven. If at expiration, the stock trades anywhere above the long call’s strike and below the breakeven point, you will lose money, however such losses will be lesser than max loss. If the stock trades anywhere above breakeven point but below the short call strike, you will make money. However, such profits will be lesser than max profit. 

Max profit zone: $53 and above
Max loss zone : $50 and below
Breakeven point: $50.90
Profit zone (not max profit):$50.91-$52.99
Loss zone (not max loss): $50.01-$50.89

**BULL CALL SPREAD TRADE PROFILE**

Max profit: Defined/Limited

Max loss: Defined/Limited

Optimal to use in Low IV environments

I've noticed that a good number of serious, professional and semi-professional intraday and swing traders focus on a couple of dozen stocks. My question is, do stocks have their own unique personalities, and if they do, what are the best ways to learn what they are?

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

To answer ur question, it just takes experience and being on top of the individual stocks. Once u get a feel of how the market moves, the patterns are easier to identify when looking at individual stocks.

AAF is a UK listed telecommunications company operating in 14 countries in Africa. As of September 2020, it had 116 million subscribers to its services and is growing fast. 

Risks:
Poor balance sheet - As at the most recent quarter, AAF had a current ratio of 0.6, meaning they don’t have enough current assets to cover their current liabilities, thus increasing the likelihood of raising addition capital. 

Currency risk - AAF earn their revenues and receive their cash in various African currencies, meaning depreciation in these currencies against the US dollar (their reporting currency) will negatively impact results. 

COVID-19 impact - Many African countries don’t have significant access to vaccines, meaning COVID can continue to cause problems in the short to mid term future. 

Opportunities: 
Huge total accessible market - AAF currently only operate in 14 out of 54 African countries. The logical path for growth is expansion into more countries. 

Fast growing market - Sub-Saharan Africa have the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world, forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%.

Intrinsic value calculation: 
To determine intrinsic value, I’ve used a discounted cash flow model and 10 year earnings multiple approach. Considering how conservative I’ve been with my growth numbers, the outcome is compelling.

Instead of accepting the gains, I decided to keep trading (greed) when I lost some of my gains. I kept chasing and chasing, until finally I wiped out my gains and lost some of my liquid capital.

If you are looking for more liquid positions maybe consider dividend investing where corporations will give you earnings per share that you can either pocket or reinvest. Analysis is the biggest part though.

I am an investor, speculation isn't really my thing, but the idea is in my head so I'm going to talk about it. If we concluded, by studying  and forecasting earnings growth, that the US stock market was overvalued, we could use that potential to hedge against the correction that is yet to perform. So we buy the index at high prices, sell calls (the option for people to buy the underlying asset at a stated price (strike price)) on the index we just bought, use those proceeds to buy puts and when the market corrects itself we have a leveraged return because of how options are priced.

n78nm1,,StockMarket,post,1620420692,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

**Highlights**

* The weak April jobs report catalyzed a rebound in technology names Friday morning, with the disappointing data easing fears that the Federal Reserve will adjust their policies in the near-term.
* Moderna (MRNA) posted a profit for the first time for Q1 2021, bolstered by revenue brought from the coronavirus vaccine. 
* ROKU and Square (SQ) both gapped up today after blowing past analyst estimates in their earnings report.
* Amid mounting pressure from antitrust regulators, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group offloaded its entire stake in a real estate trading platform, retreating from a new business for which it once held high hopes.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

The best advice I can give to young, new investors is to IGNORE the trends, and do NOT invest in individual stocks at first. 

This advice may not be exciting or sexy, and it may seem pretty vanilla, but one of the best decisions you can make as a young investor is to simply invest your money in a low-cost ETF that tracks an index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. 

The benefit of this strategy is that you’ll immediately receive diversification across multiple sectors of the economy (which is extremely important when building a portfolio), you’ll be invested in quality companies that have inherent value and aren’t just propped up by market trends, and you won’t incur the kinds of costs or capital gains taxes that come with actively managed funds. 

You may not see massive gains in the short term, and you’ll definitely see volatility, but if you want to build up as much wealth over the long-term as possible and want to have the peace of mind of knowing without a doubt that your investments will eventually recover, this is one of the best ways to get started, especially if you’re only able to invest $25 or $50 a week/month.",['SPGI']

In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium).

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

&#x200B;

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

&#x200B;

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.",['MSFT']

I did that 40 yrs ago n was a succesfull stock broker in Canada for many years I never played the market myself during that time and neither did my fellow brokers. We just sold our clients what our Mgr. told us to sell. These recomendations all came from the Research Dept at head office in Toronto. We all hated our jobs but loved the money and we really didnt have a clue back then of how the market rrally worked. Now Im retired n I just started trading online with IBKR 6 weeks ago and I got my ass kicked at first. As of today I m still down 4 % but was down 30 % two weeks ago. I read somewhere that 70 % of new retail clients on trading apps loose money. Its really hard to make a profit as the  market it seems is so manipulated by the big players these days. I suggest you also check out the biggest winners and loosers in the stock market daily. Do some research as to why they went up and down. Set up a paper trading acount and buy the ones that went down for no aparent reason ride them up and take your profit. Good luck n dont forget to put in stop loss limit orders. Go Leafs Go.,
n79dec,,StockMarket,post,1620422600,"3D Systems continues push into bioprinting with Allevi deal.The research community is critical to developing breakthrough innovations in regenerative medicine. 3D Systems, with the addition of Allevi Inc, is now able to provide a robust set of Allevi by 3D Systems bioprinting solutions to researchers and industry giants in hundreds of labs globally.

Allevi is a leading innovator in the bioprinting space with an exclusive focus on the research and development community. Leading laboratories leverage Allevi’s portfolio of hardware, biomaterials and software to design, engineer and build solutions for tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip research, pharmaceutical validation, biomaterial development, and regenerative medicine.

Allevi desktop 3D bioprinters are among the most versatile, powerful and easy-to-use bioprinters on the market. Customers also have access to a wide range of biomaterials—bioinks, bioink additives, cells, reagents and consumables—as well as an intuitive software interface.

In the medical field, 3D Sytems has delivered additive manufacturing solutions to the healthcare community for more than 30 years. Having produced more than 2,000,000 serial component medical devices and 140,000 patient-specific surgical cases, the company is now scaling the production of bioprinted clinical applications. This technology will elevate patient care through various clinical applications ranging from acellular bioresorbable devices to functionalized solid organs for transplantation.

Before bioprinter hardware manufacturer Allevi, 3D Systems had already entered the bioprinting services market. Together with United Therapeutics Corporation and its organ manufacturing and transplantation-focused subsidiary, Lung Biotechnology PBC, the company achieved significant progress in the development of next-generation bioprinting solutions for lung scaffolds that are capable of full size, vascularized, rapid, micron-level printing.
3D Systems’ capabilities as a technology innovator, spanning hardware, software, and materials science, combined with United Therapeutics’ renowned expertise in regenerative medicine has enabled advances in lung modeling, 3D printing, as well as material formulation and material handling to yield significant capabilities in bioprinters and biomaterials for the eventual production of transplantable organs.
To meet the evolving needs of the clinical and R&D communities, 3D Systems continues to push technologies to facilitate advanced application development. The Print to Perfusion process enables 3D printing of high-resolution scaffolds, which can be perfused with living cells to create tissues.
The ability to print large, vascularized, highly detailed hydrogel scaffolds at rapid speeds is opening new opportunities for a range of tissue applications. In addition, we are developing bioprinting solutions that are both commercially viable and scalable from prototype to production.

I've 10 yrs of wall st experience (research analyst / market structure). I feel a lot of your pain with the sell-off in growth names. It's definitely craziest market environments I've seen.

Here's some practical concepts and tactics to help (I will also be reviewing my portfolio over the next few days with the same plan).

**TLDR: Investing = change, Basics of business model, Estimate valuation.**

My plan is to share what I've learned into a step-by-step book. If interested, I'd love your [feedback here](https://forms.gle/RyycWAxNRsGZSxwTA) (2 minutes!). Here is the [outline of the book.](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) (Or leave a comment!) Get in on the [pre-sale!](https://gum.co/czkJr)\*

**Investing = change.** A basic reminder that we buy shares of businesses that will be worth more in the future. There is some change happening and the business will have higher future finances. The fun (and painful) part is using a thesis (expectations) and matching it with your risk tolerance and goals.

I am fairly confident ecommerce will grow in SE Asia and the $SE founder will execute. And also I am willing still willing to bet that banks will want to use A.I. type credit decisioning with $UPST.

Focus on the change - the y/y % growth in the future - and the future valuation of the business.

*$RKT is perfect example of this. The guidance for 2Q21 loan volumes is 14%, which is a huge slowing from the 100+% y/y rate in 1Q21. Earning estimates are coming down for '22/23, especially since everyone knows their business declined in '17-18 and '13-14 with rate hikes. So the stock continues to be sold off.*

*And it works in the opposite way too! if rates decline and loan volumes increase 21/'22 (more than expected), estimates will likely go up and the stock will too!*

**Understand business model.** Also the basics -simplify the company to a way that you can estimate its future value. What is the value of its product and service to customers, what type of market is it in? What is management's vision - particularly its strategy to grow and the source of profits?

You can get these from MD&A sections in 10Ks, investor presentations, and videos with management.

For example, I've learned that $PLBY new management plans expand licensing into several consumer product areas, where the value to customers is the brand assets. And also the $DMTK product value is a non-invasive test which is supposed to more economical and the growth will come from insurance coverage. This leads to...

**Estimate future valuation.** Businesses are valued on future growth (size in the future) and the future cash flows they will generate. The basic high-level steps to get there:

*Unit economics /revenue* \- estimate the volume and price of products / services over the next few years. For example, tests / transactions and $ per unit, to get revenues.

*Estimate the margin* \- what are the expenses to get there, and more importantly, what can be ""leveraged"" i.e. have more sales per $ of costs. For example, higher prices per unit usually creates higher gross margins. This gets you earnings (which over-time, equals cash flows).

*Estimate balance sheet use* \- capital will be needed to expand the business. This is ""capex"" or ""R&D"" or similar for innovative companies. Negative earnings also means cash will be used.

*Estimate capital raises.* This means debt (increases financial ""leverage"" or change in earnings with revenues, both ways, and also bankruptcy risk), or from equity (which dilutes your share).

*Estimate value* \- A tool for this is ""multiples"" off forward metrics. For example, enterprise value (EV) / next twelve months (NTM) sales. EV / NTM EBITDA and P/E are popular for earnings.

Find peers (similar business model, space and financial profile). You can use proxy peers or similar analyst coverage. Take their multiples and apply it to your estimated future sales or earnings.

**Now you have an estimate of where the stock can go.** Make sure to discount it back (say 10%) each year which is your required level of return for holding stocks. Have this to manage your idea.

Happy investing everyone!!!

The pandemic didn't slow down anything because the Fed is ""printing money""? Is this trend going to continue? Is this a bubble that is going to burst? Is this a good moment to invest in companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc?

-many speculative stocks were in a ‘bubble’ and have/are crashing. They had crazy valuations and many, maybe even most, had no profits. Valued solely on their sales and sky high they’ve seen a crash down like 50%. 

-at the same time this fear has moved that money to ‘value’ stocks. Mainly the traditional financial sector, energy, and utilities. And here we go again! Up goes companies stock that in many cases are also not supported by financial success. 

-the fed is printing money and handing it out. This feeds the economy in theory and worked back 2008 but we’ll see what affect it has now. 

-Biden admin is doing some policy stuff that freaks people out. Tax those cap gains on millionaires, waiving pharmaceutical patents, plans to raise min wage, etc. Every time they have a press conference something freaks people out and a little dip of 1-3% seems to happen. Short lived though. 

-big tech and profitable ‘growth’ companies are flat. They are not in a bubble. With slight high valuations compared to past, they still are projected to double or more in 5 years when equalized to avg valuations. So just like every past bubble, the smart buys are on companies that produce continual cash growth. Learn how to value companies and estimate growth and you can be confident in what you purchase.",

My return is presently positive.

I'd like to sell right now, and reinvest after it tanks, if it does. But the problem is, I'm not confident that it's going to tank as badly as the short term capital gains taxes I'd pay (my returns have been like 80% on one of them)

In other words, Im going to lose roughly 30% in taxes if I sell. I don't believe that it's going to tank badly enough for me to lose as much as I will if I sell.

So, what finally, what I'm wondering is if there's some sort of system I can use to pull the money out of the stocks, but not he able to use it, and not pay taxes on it. Obviously it has to be legal.

n8f30j,,wallstreetbets,post,1620569783,"Got losses. No worries, it's just a tax write off.Remember that the system was made to benefit the market. If you are an American Tax Payer. Capital Gains tax can be something you are worried about. But you also have Capital Loss Dedications. If you are married and filing jointly or Single (like most retail investors are), you can claim 3k deduction. For married but filing separately folks, it's 1.5k. Best part about the system, losses carry over till the amount is fully used as a deduction (15k loss in a year translates to 5 years worth of 3k deductions). 

Example. If I lost 15k on my plays before the end of the taxable year (December 31st 2020) and I'm married filing jointly. I can get a 3k deduction from my taxable income or capital gains for my 2020 taxes. This then drops my capital loss down ammount to 12k. Next year for my 2021 taxes, I can use another 3k deduction from the 2020 losses to drop my taxable income. This again drops my capital loss from 2020 to 9k. You can continue to do this till that capital loss amount hits zero. 

Key point, no matter how much you gained in a year in trading, it doesn't just make your capital losses just disappear. Even if I gained in 2021, I can still use the 2020 capital losses to offset all taxable income sources. So make sure you claim those losses WSB. You didn't lose trading, you simply made it so your taxable income is offset in the years to follow.

Edit: Just to clarify. It has to a be a total lose at the end of the tax year. This means that after gains and losses. You have to lose money. This can only be calculated on closed out positions. Holding assets if they depreciate in value, doesn't mean it is considered a loss. ""It's only a loss if you sell"".

Edit 2: Someone brought up Gains. If I lost money one year but gained money the next. My 3k deduction gets applied to the Capital Gains tax first. If I lost 15k in 2019 but made 15k in 2020. My 2020 gains will be taxed as making 12k. Now if I  made only 2k in 2020. I don't pay taxes on that 2k and that 1k left over goes to my taxable income. Consecutive year losses doesn't just make it compound either. It just make a different deduction pot later down the road.

Edit 3: Something I forgot to mention but another poster did. Losses on wash sales don't apply. Look up Wash Sales if you don't know what it is.

Edit 4: I attempted to make it clear but failed to do so. The Capital Loss is a deduction, not a credit. This means that it isn't exactly a 1-1 solution. What I was trying to convey is that a Capital Loss can lower your taxable income. This doesn't means that you will get 3k back in  a return but that you taxable income is reduced by 3k. So if you are in the upper limit of a tax bracket, that 3k offset to taxable income may mean little. But if you are in the lower end of a tax bracket, that 3k may be able to put you down another bracket so you can qualify for other deductions or credits.

Edit 5: removed realized to avoid confusion with Tax Credits.",

n8ek8d,,wallstreetbets,post,1620567942,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/q29ncm07m3y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e400362006ce7ce4571361731cece094ba3b9d38)

GME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/sdfgfdncm3y61.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc44dd645aa9f8fdba923805c7013156328d8b70

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. 

**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. 

**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. 

**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. 

**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

n8g0l3,,wallstreetbets,post,1620572635,"Next level DD: CLOV**\*TL;DR at the bottom**

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.

&#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.

&#x200B;

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which are looked until the price reached $30 for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as a Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.

&#x200B;

**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”

&#x200B;

* The development of this software is led by Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.

&#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.

&#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

&#x200B;

**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**

&#x200B;

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock – 2M, Baillie Gifford & Co– 5M: They are either mutual fund & long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that’s a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc…. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f4a9il0d04y61.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2174d92db10eaba3718379314e7ce74be1b0cc6

&#x200B;

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there’s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xdtvus3e04y61.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=6606fb497bdeecbf1d16e79b6d553936335bdd3d

&#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF’s are digging their own graves by doing that!

https://preview.redd.it/4iy1xxjf04y61.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6aef16302c77a723226aece12c2c75d487fa94c

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/0jmhtglg04y61.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=e71646759dca08ce9fd2da917df085d7d19b4e0d

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K – 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.

&#x200B;

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

&#x200B;

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

&#x200B;

*“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*

&#x200B;

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

&#x200B;

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short & gamma squeeze” candidate).

&#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&#x200B;

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser.

n8b6gm,,wallstreetbets,post,1620554722,"ALIBABA (BABA)

Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here’s why:

GROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%.

The company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028.

Debt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say.

Alibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view:

1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users.

2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly.

3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the “per-product-cost”.

4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform.

PRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of  20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap.

WHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are 

A) Usa-China relationships

B)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population

—> WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: 

CCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his “diamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent.

CCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the “formula” that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism.

For these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share.

So, with earnings in companies like ACB and SNDL coming up this week, I think it's time to take a look at all of this again. I won't rehash my discussions about supply chains and marketable brands here, because I already talked about that in my last thread.

Instead, I wanna talk about earnings. Historically, a lot of these Canadian weed companies have had some pretty shit earnings, and they're debt has carried at way too high capacities. Here's why I think that's about to change.

Earnings have consistently been improving, especially during pandemic times. Let's face facts, more and more people are starting to like weed. The pandemic put a lot of us in our homes with nothing better to do than to spark up every couple of hours. 2020 generally saw improved earnings for a lot of these companies as people began more actively using marijuana over things like alcohol. Personally, I think this trend is gonna continue. As a former dude who drank way the fuck too much, moving to an American state where weed is legal got me to transition from drinking to smoking or using edibles. While I still drink, it's very rare and I generally use weed because I can wake up the next morning and not feel like someone drove a train into my head. It's also been cheaper in the long run. I used to spend 40 bucks on good whiskey that would last me a week, sometimes a week and a half. Now, I spend 30 bucks on weed that lasts me two weeks. With the news that American legal sales recently hit all-time highs, I think we're going to see this trend continuing as people transition to more regular cannabis use. This increasing trend will only bolster what I mentioned in my last post about supply chains and marketable brands.

Additionally, the Biden Admin is discussing cutting the amount of nicotine allowable in cigarettes in half. I believe that this type of action will trend towards cigarette smokers turning to marijuana instead. While I've not read any direct studies or anything on the matter, I've had three different friends who all used marijuana to help alleviate withdrawals from quitting smoking and then became regular cannabis users. While obviously the submarkets for alcohol and tobacco products will remain plenty strong, the push for American legalization is going to continue to leech consumers from those markets into the cannabis market. Increased social acceptability and turning from other ""sin products"" to marijuana are going to combine with the supply chains and branding advantages Canadian Cannabis already holds to create a power house when America fully legalizes. 

For the above reasons, I'm staying bullish af on companies like ACB, TLRY, etc.",

\*\*The model only uses price data and doesn't look at earnings (which is Tuesday), fundamentals, insider selling, etc if you want to go read about how Alex Karp or Peter Thiel sold 275 million. & 500 Million in shares go read another DD

POS: Long 700 Shares, Short 1x Jan '22 27C, 1x Jan '23 30C, 1x Jan '23 35c.

I built a Monte Carlo simulation to help make Palantir Tendies since the stock has been slapped back down to $19/share from its high in January. A look at the stock price since IPO:

[Remembering when those PLTR tendies came so easy...](https://preview.redd.it/599wmdagf1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd1baf4fa2ed08ebf2158eba39c4a14d66740c5)

Looking at the top 20 daily percent change days, we can see since IPO top 20 days where PLTR has gone up have been bigger in magnitude than the top 20 down days. This is good for us holding long positions. 

[Top 20 up days by daily &#37; change](https://preview.redd.it/8mfajlrre1y61.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53ae9ac4ae158b5241942b644462ab46ab819385)

[Top 20 down days by &#37; Change ](https://preview.redd.it/4zrorfmye1y61.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ed083e595dc7f3edc36d76603de708a56bfdaf5)

For the model, I took daily % change for every trading day since IPO, from there I found average daily percent change (aka drift) and standard deviation of daily percent change( (aka volatility 6.26%). Since the average daily percent change is positive (.67%), we can say PLTR has positive drift (statistical proof that stonks only go up). This was calculated since IPO, meaning it may not be the case in the future.  

&#x200B;

[some wrinkle brain math](https://preview.redd.it/bfwi3fl7g1y61.jpg?width=685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d267252ddf7da2e91eb704fdf55307f734bd603)

&#x200B;

From here I took the last closing price ($19.75) and added drift plus/minus a random value equal to some number in between plus/minus 6 standard deviations (assuming a normal distribution.) to find the next day's closing price and continued that until the end of the simulation, Then repeat the simulation 10,000 times. If you want to read more about how a monte-carlo/random walk works, go read on Investopedia or something.

Here are the outputs:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since a year is too messy to really get anything useful here is the prediction for the next 60 Days (42 trading days)

[Pick a price between green and red line](https://preview.redd.it/5ufmrp0ai1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c262c5c8be936f36e95edf555e7685a38ab62b91)

The confidence interval refers to how many of the scenarios fell underneath that line (remember this was run 10,000 times). So out of 10,000 Monte Carlo moves, 95% fell below the green line, 5% were below the red line and 50% were below the blue line. Basically, the green line is your faggy-d for a long call, the red line is a cheap hedge for a long put, and the 50% line is the ""most likely"" outcome. Prices are 5%: 12.21, 50%: 24.14, 95%: $46.73  Also the distribution of outcomes:  

&#x200B;

[Price Distribution for 60 day Monte Carlo - Most common value \~$21\/share](https://preview.redd.it/m33x6t4mi1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2c91921bfef6229c2957b90d33d3bb2818f6400)

Does it work??

To see if the Monte Carlo even works I truncated the data in the model by limiting the dates used to predict future price and made it predict the price for days that are already past. I then plotted them vs how the sock actually traded that day. 

[from Mar 21-May 21 stock underperformed model](https://preview.redd.it/yzyzj16ek1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d452f72e47593ce17b574b6b626407f6b1426d56)

From March to May, Pltr stayed with the prediction for about 10/42 trading days then underperformed compared to the predicted price. If you wanted to speculate you could go long looking for a regression to the 50% confidence interval. 

&#x200B;

[From Jan 21 - Mar 21](https://preview.redd.it/11u5zuprk1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=57db219c2000bf3273751a5b4866c56b54ea57ae)

From January to March PLTR followed the 50% line for \~23 days then moved to the 5% line. hedging with long puts around 5% confidence interval would have likely made big tendies.

&#x200B;

[From Nov 20 to Jan 21](https://preview.redd.it/lxkddo0cm1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4251559b1db81bd610a7a4d7cc1d83fb591c7f99)

From November 20 to January 21, PLTR traded at or above the 50% confidence interval.

If anything, the bullish case for precious metals and miners has strengthened, especially from a fundamental perspective.

Quick on the heels of its $1.9tln stimulus package, the Biden White House is now doubling down on another $3tln infrastructure package. With tax receipts going nowhere, the budget deficit is set to explode to record highs. Much of the debt issued to finance, this additional spending will likely be funded by the Fed. In order to do so, they will be forced to increase QE and that will probably occur at the same time that they announce explicit Yield Curve Control.

Under such a scenario, stocks rise and bond yields stabilize or fall. At the same time, inflation expectations are likely to rise. This means that real yields are set to fall faster than nominal yields. All of which is the perfect scenario for precious metals and miners. But all of this money printing must have consequences and the likely casualty is the dollar. A weaker dollar would also contribute to higher inflation expectations. Again, great for Gold, Silver, and the mining companies. It’s just a question of when.

On the one hand, the Biden administration is clearly eager to get this next bill through Congress as fast as possible. However, Republicans are likely to choke on the amount of pork barrel spending included in the Bill. Hence, expect a little to-and-fro to slow its passage but given the Democrats control of all levels of government, I believe it will ultimately pass in one form or another in May at the latest. If so, we can finally look forward to a bottom in precious metals and miners at some point over the next couple of weeks,if not already in place.

SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio)

With respect to the SLR exemption that the Fed decided not to extend, the Fed did say that it would review the SLR requirements. Given the need to fund $3tln of new debt to fund the latest stimulus package, I guesstimate that the Fed is far more likely to loosen the constraints of the SLR in some way to facilitate the banks assistance in financing the biggest supply of new bonds the market has ever seen in such a short period of time. Such news, if it transpires, would also hasten the peak in the dollar and real yields and the bottom in Gold et al.

NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)

Like the SLR, the NSFR is another facet of new Basel 3 regulations that are being implemented worldwide in response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 to ensure that financial institutions have sufficient high-quality assets to weather a similar crisis in the future without having to resort to bailouts. In essence, these new regulations are designed to mitigate the risk of bankruptcies such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

With respect to gold specifically, the  regulators will significantly penalize Bullion Banks holding Gold in unallocated accounts relative to fully allocated accounts. Unallocated means you have a ‘share’ in a certain amount of Gold whereas allocated means that you own the rights to a specific amount of  gold. Unallocated gold can be leveraged, loaned out, more than once, creating multiple claims on the same amount of Gold. Allocated cannot. In other words, the Banks will be penalized for unallocated  gold holdings and rewarded for holding the actual physical metal on an unlevered basis. Simply put, it makes it expensive for the Banks to engage in Gold lending or hypothecation. Gold lending is widely considered one of the principal tools used to short Gold .Eliminating or drastically reducing this activity therefore makes it more difficult to short the metal  weather gold or silver and is therefore bullish.

This is one of many reasons why gold has been under pressure for 8 months now. In anticipation of this new regulation, Banks would clearly not want to be short the metal. They are motivated to get out of their short positions and even get long. This is what they have been trying to do since the peak in open interest in January 2020:

Open interest has now fallen to its lowest level since May 2019, when Gold hit a low of ~1269. Note that the last peak in open interest was in August 2020 and Gold has been going down ever since.

Banks loathe to take a loss on their short positions so they have been waiting for lower prices to cover these positions. They have accelerated this process since January, which is reflected in the drop in open interest since then, and are far closer to at least being neutral. Reportedly, JP Morgan is already net neutral to long. Now it’s just the remaining Bullion Banks trying to get out of their short positions ahead of the new rules to be implemented and the expected rally to begin soon.

This is just further evidence that the bottom is or close for gold and silver .

CONCLUSION

While we continue to patiently endure weakness in precious metals and miners in the short-term, even as nominal and real yields ease back from their recent peaks, the big picture continues to improve, setting us up for a truly spectacular rally to begin within the next pulpe of weeks .

Key support levels to watch on the downside and possibly “the lows” are 1800 and 27 in Gold and Silver respectively.",

n877f3,,wallstreetbets,post,1620537173,"Palantir (PLTR) Valuation Comparison with its High Growth SaaS PeersI am a data engineer in finance. I am embarking on a new journey to provide data analysis and transparency to retail traders. Stock price, sentiment and news headline can be manipulated by the street, but data is your ""seeing stone"" . Here is my quick notes about Palantir:- I did some analysis (linear regression) on growth SaaS companies. At $20, PLTR is **neither cheap nor overpriced** among peers.

\- The recent week's drop was spread across the high growth SaaS sector. If you see the price drop of SaaS stocks or simply ARKK fund, it is highly correlated to the **sector rotation** on inflation concern.

\- I saw people joking about whenever PLTR signed a deal, its stock dropped. Correlation does not mean causation. PLTR is projected to grow its revenue by 30%+, which is 300M+/y, or on average 25M+/m. To keep this growth, you would naturally expect at least signing two new 10M+ contracts each month. So please **do not get over hyped** when PLTR get a multi-million dollar contract. Think about the overall impact.

\- Despite the recent price drop of PLTR, SI stays at historical low at 2.68% by s3 partners. Total inst. holdings at 30% but the number of holders increased significantly to \~600. I heard that HFs still **wait for earning to confirm** the commercial growth due to recent sector/macro risk

\- Key stock catalyst is next Tuesday's PLTR earning after hour. Keep an close eye a few key metrics, including **profitability timeline**, **Q1 revenue growth** (especially on the commercial side) , **2021 revenue guidance**, **contribution margin** and **stock based compensation (SBC)**

\- My model shows PLTR at **$20 is the fair value** given 30% Rev CAGR & 12% discount rate for 4B'25 goal from mgmt. But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat & raise. There is certainly short term hype & risk. But I am **bullish** with a **2-5y horizon**

\- As of May 9, **130.8M worth of contracts signed** this year with U.S Gov for PLTR

It's pretty much UFC (it is the majority owner now and will own 100% of it via a buyout) plus a bunch of miscellaneous companies. Most of these miscellaneous companies are pretty worthless IMO, but I am buying it as a pure play on UFC.

Short-term catalysts: Hot IPO as MMA is really getting popular now, Elon as board-member. Good memestock potential.

Long-term outlook: Pricing is at a slight premium but given the trajectory of sports franchise valuation, it's pretty safe to say that at some point UFC will justify $20B+ even as a value play. Which means that even if it doesn't fly high right now, at some point it should go back up. There's little risk of being left holding a permanent bag.

It's not even a year the company went public via DPO and he sold over 14 million shares already. His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively)

Now let's look at some **counter arguments**\-

**Automatic sell:**

Looking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public?

**DPO vs IPO:**

You might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true.

**Stock-based Compensations**:

You might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?

**He needs money like everyone else:**

Another argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more.

**TlDr:** Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently. If he does not like the stock of his company then who the hell am I.",['MMM']

“4 IntroductionSARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, continues to be a major threat to worldwide health and economic productivity. As of April 2021, there have been over 32 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and 575,000 deaths in the United States6. Most infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have mild to moderate disease characterized by symptoms such as cough, fever, and mild pneumonia7. Previous infection data indicated that 19 percent of infections result in severe, potentially life-threating disease characterized by shortness of breath, rapid respiratory rates, lung infiltrates, and oxygen desaturation <94%6,8,9. Due to the rapid viral spread, it is imperative that safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 be immediately developed for ease of worldwide deployment to end the pandemic. Despite the authorization of three vaccines for emergency use in the United States11-13 and the release of several more vaccines worldwide13-16, SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to outpace the administration of vaccines in several countries across the globe demonstrating that the current vaccine supply is far from sufficient. In India alone, there were 6 million new infections and 46 thousand new deaths in the month of April6. Some of the currently authorized vaccines are mRNA-based and have unique cold storage and distribution requirements that present extra challenges to the world17,18. Vaccines that can offer improved safety and tolerability profiles could help overcome vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, the development of vaccines that are temperature stable can help to improve the global distribution to countries with little or no capacity for cold storage.”",

If all is accurate this is what I found. 

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish 
2. They just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of his own money
3. Completed the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow. 
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing 
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone. 
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

n7um6w,,wallstreetbets,post,1620496439,"CLOV will be a multi-baggerI'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)

Below is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):

1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let’s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) – a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover’s business model is so fool proof!***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***
2. **Competition:** Now let’s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***
3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover’s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***
4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let’s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this…as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn’t….60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover’s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***
5. **Customers:** Let’s now put some light on the target demographic…seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.
6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance…except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money…now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.
7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock – he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as board member and dem access. Recently they added the former director of Medicare - literally the only possible guy in the world that can get them what they need to continue growth for years to come.**
8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \~$3B, which is \~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover’s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated…upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond….it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space – TDOC – and a Cathie Wood & ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***

I am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.

CLOV YOLO

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** as someone correctly pointed out below, heavy investors such as Vanguard, Blackrock and Bailee Gifford (Tesla mega bulls) all bought in at a mid $8 price point.

**Edit 2:** as requested below, there is also a bear case which simply means CLOV might take time to realize its full potential...which is different than saying it will go into the ground.   
**B1. Competition:** new competitors trying to enter the fast growing (but boring) MA market with an advanced tech platform ala Clover Assistant could impact growth rate (not growth). I think its highly unlikely but possible specially when Biden announces lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Smaller companies might want to get in on the gold rush. And legacy companies may want to invest heavily into revamping their business model (UNLIKELY - why? read [The Innovators Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-audiobook/dp/B06Y4RRGVV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7diEBhB-EiwAskVi11l5HeOM_5nz4Z9EMKJHbGR9bSEs5YenWuxP8ykS-TP5AKJo1UhP1hoCiTkQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241921991729&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1018704&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3239668408352121876&hvtargid=kwd-59432786&hydadcr=24632_10399692&keywords=the+innovators+dilemma&qid=1620501116&sr=8-1))  
**B2: Management:** management churn might impact the vision on which this company was founded. Vivek is a visionary - but the short report, legal challenges, DOJ inquiries, can impact his and his teams performance though the upcoming ER should lay to rest any such doubts.

n80r2l,,wallstreetbets,post,1620514949,"High conviction stock/leaps list.Figured I should share some after doing super deep analysis on a lot of these companies. I've written DD on some of these and will continue to write on them in depth.  My view on stocks is that you should pick and play on stocks that 

A) Care about reputation

B) Deliver

C) Contain economic consequences and economic challenges

I'm extremely engaged by developing and improving my portfolio and I strongly believe that investors should go big and stay mentally tough through the good times and bad. In other words, the advice that I value most is by Charlie Munger:  


>“If you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you’re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.”

 I actually hate posting in r/stocks and r/investing because posts l feel that the culture in that forum is the opposite of this advice and seems to value cowardice more than conviction. I find it incredibly annoying and sheepish. 

These are my picks, that I've researched obsessively and believe will result in substantial wealth building over time.

n80k3r,,wallstreetbets,post,1620514322,"Do you think this strategy can beat the S&P 500?So lets say you do your DD on a company you think has solid fundamentals regarding P/E ratio, RSI, type of leadership, new technology that can increase company's value, multiple analyst viewpoints, any whatever else I may have missed. Based on this research you buy long call options deep ITM that expire in a year or more so you avoid the bad kind of capital gains tax. It should be a given, but you buy long calls instead of buying shares since you can theoretically invest more this way.

&#x200B;

Next part is assuming the stock goes up eventually or even if it doesn't go up, because the breakeven point is going to be really close to what the current share price is at at the time of purchasing the long calls, you start selling call options each week or month off the long call options that you bought and you aim for something like a delta of .14 so that there is a low chance of assignment.  Even if you do get assigned from a stock jumping up that much, it's safe to assume your investment has paid off as long as if the short call you sold has a strike above the break even point of your long call. 

&#x200B;

Now the reason of selling the short calls off your long calls is because you will be doing all of this on margin as well for maximum gain potential. You need a way to pay off the margin interest so that's where selling those calls come into play and you'll probably have more than enough to pay off that interest and to pay the short term capital gains tax to still have a little extra for yourself. 

&#x200B;

Lastly you would diversify among 5-10 different companies that are all in completely separate industries so they don't correlate with each other whenever there is a downturn in a sector reason being is if you go into a margin call, you can sell one of your winners to temporarily let your loser get back up on its feet so you aren't forced to sell at a loss.

They provide literally any equipment you’d need on a construction site.

Following data will be the past 4 quarterly reports:

Q3 EPS beat +928.53% revenue beat +3.23% 

Q42020 EPS beat +836.25% revenue beat +3.92 

Q1 2021 EPS beat +140% Revenue beat +3.96. 

No matter what data you’re looking at in the past year. They’ve not taken a lose once. No one can say when this winning streak will come to an end. However with the demand for construction sky rocketing. One can only speculate, it won’t be anytime soon. This is largely due to COVID restrictions being lifted as well as Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Now let’s focus a little on the infrastructure bill aspect. There’s a lot of speculation which companies will benefit the most from this. Though trying to pinpoint who’ll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let’s focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains. They’re gonna need a lot of supplies for the job. That’s where TEX the glorious Terex shines.

I am hoping some on here that have been fortunate enough to experience owning call options for a stock that is experiencing a short squeeze can answer for me.  During a short squeeze, once the stock price reaches levels much higher than anyone expected, are you able to sell your call options for a fair price or are the buyers of your calls cashing in on a big discount from you?

https://preview.redd.it/0vfuohmplrx61.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ec4444fbbf936dcac53ffdca7f5f0d530789e1

Let's get some facts straight, because it hurts me to see how all of you amateurs are being played by the master poker players of Wall Street.

# Real Estate prices

Home prices are hitting record highs. Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.

# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too

Ummm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?

Listen to the CEO: ""*out of my 12000 brokers less than 500 said they were gonna go with them, you will see that in the Q2 numbers*"" - [https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20](https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20)

# Dividend

I know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that your dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:

* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield

Basically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *""don't buy a stock just for the dividend""*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

Fun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.

# Russell Index

Remember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?

https://preview.redd.it/1tb8i3ikprx61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b49973b32b0f6171a51cbf110250ab48b3187d

Well the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for consideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.

# Bluffing

The definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - ""*What if my stock goes to zero?*"" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:

* **We covered on GME** \- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!
* **AMC is going bankrupt** \- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!
* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \- Are you gonna fall for it again?

# Mathematical pressure

You see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.

At some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.

You wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.

I will first say that I am NEW to trading so take my opinion cautiously and do your own DD. I am NEW compared to the 100 year old WSB OGs. This is my disclaimer.

I am not confident enough to write DD but Im working on it. One thing I do know is whenever I follow Blackrocks moves, I make green sometimes sooner sometimes later.

I was first hesitant with CLOV because of the legal investigation but that appears to be losing muster.

I have $10 Calls and $11 Calls for 06/18 and will start adding shares on Monday . I am looking at Jan 2022 CALLS to give me longer term perspective on this stock.

Two are extremely bearish, one is very bullish.  I don't really know how they're going to play out in the markets, but I figured I'd bring some attention to t them so all of you could keep them in mind when betting.  Here they are in chronological order:

1. The end of the Eviction/Foreclosure Moratorium.  This one is hugely bearish, and could potentially crash the housing market, or at least cool it off.  Since the pandemic started, there's been various Federal and State bans on foreclosures and evictions.  In a normal year around 3 million Americans get evicted/foreclosed on.  This all expires on June 30.  Or SOONER, because last week a judge ruled against the program and the Biden admin is emergency appealing it.  It's been well over a year with this going on now, so it could lead to as many as 4 million homes/apartments getting dumped on the market in a very short time period.
2. The start of the kid based Stimulus payments.  This one, like all stimmy programs, is super bullish.  In July the checks start going out, $250 to $300 per kid, per month, paying until at least December.  That's a lot of money going into families' hands, and it will get spent, because kids are basically just roving germ factories that devour money.  I don't really see this program talked about anywhere, and even a lot of people with kids I know are unaware of it.  Surprise free money gets spent even faster than expected free money.
3. The end of student loan forbearance in September.  This one is unbelievably bearish.  Basically, everyone in prime spending ages is going to get hit with hundreds to thousands of dollars a month in bills that they haven't had to pay for a year plus at this point.  It's effectively a huge tax hike on the working class and working professionals, and is going to have some pretty negative implications for spending, because that's tens of millions of people who largely don't have extra money all of a sudden sending hundreds or thousands of $$ a month to the feds instead of spending it on Artisanal Gourd Toast or Pumpkin Spice iPhones.

So basically this summer/early fall we've got a big spike coming in homes on the market, a large, mostly ignored round of stimulus hitting people with kids, followed by a huge cliff in consumers disposable income.

So, I dunno, bet against the housing market in June/July/August, on Disney in July-December, and against anything people under 40 buy after September?

Curious what everyone else thinks about these things coming up.  And obviously the feds could pass bills changing any of these, but I think congress at this point is more likely to nothing than something unless/until their own portfolios get affected.",

n70cim,,wallstreetbets,post,1620399220,"My first DD: I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshotFirst of all this is all just my speculation and not financial advice. I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to stocks and I've only been doing this for like a couple months. I am not a financial advisor or professional. What I am is a physician with at least some literacy, though not expertise, in oncology. In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training. Without further ado...I present my first DD:

I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron\_rgen\_is\_rumored\_to\_be\_buying\_out\_ino/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron_rgen_is_rumored_to_be_buying_out_ino/)). The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had ""MD"" in it so it caught my attention...but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC (epic is the #1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar) and anyone asking that probably 1) is actually a doctor and 2) doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate...the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician...not much unlike the famous Dr. Burry

That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to ""do my own DD"" as they say. Now I am not 100% sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that  I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well (ok just a little well), right?

Background

I open the patent application and read up on it. My first impression? Lol you can't treat GBM. For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma)) that is one of the few ""death sentences"" that exist in medicine. I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch. Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this. Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much. Patients die within a year basically 100% of the time even with advances such as ""gamma knife"" radiation. I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable. But then I read more about their tech and the patent and....wait a second this actually sounds legit. So now to break down some of the science behind this....

Methods

INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes. To put it in non-doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain. Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment) due to what is called the blood brain barrier. Your brain is (reasonably so) walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there. Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either. In particular the medicine they have developed (INO 5401) is a PD-1 inhibitor, but delivered into the brain. As soon as I saw PD-1 this peaked my interest hard. anti PD-1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that ""uncloak"" cancer from hiding from your immune system. The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab)) which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma. The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug. That's where INO comes in with their patented tech.

Results

Go to the patent link above and click ""images"". This is the money shot. MRI on left = v bad cancer. MRI on the right = cancer is dead. What. Yep. Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution. Mind blowing. Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD-1 inhibitors is varied. Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS. I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away...but only in some patients. I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured. Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment. Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro-oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously? Google her.

Conclusion

Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money? I go look up the study. This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective (phase 1 = is the drug safe, phase 2 = does the drug work...did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies?). I saunter over to clinical[trials.gov](https://trials.gov) (the federal website where all clinical trials are listed) and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021. The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol...meaning they have 99% of their data and the study is essentially complete. I then saunter over to [google.com](https://google.com) (the worlds largest search engine) and look for other data they have. Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html)). ""Overall survival"" and ""Progression free survival"" are the holy grails of results in cancer research. The fact that they have 80% progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing. I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent. But again ... how is it that this is gonna moon soon? Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences. [https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc\_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf). Dates: May 12, May 18. Not just a one tiered moon shot, but a two tiered moon shot! 

Discussion

In conclusion: their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug, to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent. Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings. I don't know what I'm more excited about...a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon. I like the stock. I like the tech. I like the implications to cancer treatment.

Disclosures: No affiliation with any of the above companies. I bought lots calls as well as stock this morning. I have no idea what I'm doing. In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from this information please let me know.",['GOOGL']

1. INO-5401 is ""a combination of 3 separate DNA plasmids targeting Wilms tumor gene-1 (WT1) antigen, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) genes.
2. The actual PD-1 inhibitor is Regeneron's cemiplimab, which is being delivered by IV infusion
3. Inovio's technology is the use of plasmids in combination w/ electroporation to allow cellular uptake of the plasmids. The plasmids are being delivered intramuscularly followed by electroporation, I assume of the surrounding tissue? I don't understand your conclusion about BBB penetration based on this. Unless the PD-1 inhibitor can actually make its way past the BBB, its utility is questionable.

That being said, if the 80% progress-free survival is actually true, that is indeed impressive.",

I just listened to [two podcasts](https://youtu.be/chE2OEToxOg) where the ex-market maker JJ Gorilla u/vwaptrader1 tells it from the other side.

  
As retail traders, we have to admit that we chase price, but we should learn from our mistakes as quickly as possible. One way to do that is to learn the mechanics and business of doing a deal.

In episode 187, JJ goes on to say why he feels the $GME action wasn't all business and more needs to be considered to what is going on from those who hold the stock and how impressed he was with r/wallstreetbets. From what I took from the convo, in essence, he has a gut feeling that someone is using the hype to get out of GME and he's looking to the management.

What was even more interesting to me was the way he talks about Supply and the order of events in which the Business gets done.  As he explained that Supply is the key to everything and how a market maker's job is to facilitate those that need to sell their supply of stock/securities/assets etc. and to provide liquidity to those traders looking to buy up to that Supply.
