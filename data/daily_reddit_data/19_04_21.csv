The world’s largest carmaker previewed its “bZ4X,” an electric SUV sitting on its new “e-TNGA” platform

 at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show on Monday. The vehicle is a compact SUV that resembles Toyota’s popular Rav-4, but is built on a entirely new platform and features a distinctive yoke instead of a traditional steering wheel, as well as a system that can recharge the car’s battery using solar power.

By 2025 Toyota plans to introduce 15 EVs, including seven “bZ” series models globally, said Toyota Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda, speaking at a briefing Monday. The bZ4X is the first of the “bZ” series, which stands for “beyond zero,” or cars that exceed being “just zero-emission,” according to Toyota. Toyota plans to produce the bZ4X in Japan and China and sell it worldwide by mid-2022.

In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop -  ""I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip""; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.

It taught me a valuable lesson, **max out retirement accounts** with low cost mutual funds and **save 15% cash of yearly income** for emergencies, after that than **purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends**.

Then and only then  develop a \~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD.  For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by \~15% I am out but will watch).  On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)

So when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out.  Retiring early and been enjoying the good life.

Today, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active.

Good Luck.

mu15nv,gv39y9z,stocks,comment,1618845852,"I remember reading an article about a couple who had next to no capital, but who just got a loan of tens of millions of dollars and started buying and flipping entire apartment buildings. Again, with nothing but a loan from a bank. I was a teenager at the time with a fledgling interest in financial markets, but I remember thinking that this was a respected financial publication and here we are listening to this couple explaining how everyone else is an idiot for not getting a loan from their local bank and flipping apartment buildings, and the magazine I read it from was treating them like they were the smartest people they'd ever interviewed.

I remember people talking about how property was dirt cheap and that prices cannot go anywhere but up - and I'm not even from the U.S. This was a global phenomenon. I remember how TV had nothing but ads of banks pushing loans with fixed interest of only 4% - which in today's negative interest world probably seems ludicrous, but where I'm from, banks stress test your mortgage viability by calculating an interest rate of 6% even today. Also, for a short time, banks were allowed to give out mortgages of like 60 years, and I remember a friend of mine telling me about this couple who worked at the same factory as he did, and they both made minimum wage and still managed to get a mortgage of 1 million euros for 60 years. 

Two months later the factory closed down, I don't know what happened to the couple, but you can't get a mortgage of 60 years here anymore. Law prohibits it.

I was actually very vocal about my skepticism of the whole thing. Not only did the dumbest people in my social circles dish out investment advice, but newspapers and magazines and other publications celebrated the people who took insane risk that they clearly didn't understand. Like ""interest rates can't go up"" (technically they were right), and ""I'm worth 10 million on paper"" - no, they weren't. They had 10 million in liabilities and a slight change in either the property price or the interest rate will mean you'll be liquidating all of your assets. A lot of these people couldn't perform basic percentage calculations - like they couldn't understand why you'd still be in the red if a stock price went down 10% today and rose 10% tomorrow, but they were still being hailed as the people who were proof that Warren Buffett didn't know anything about how to make money in this new world.

I see a lot of that today, again. It's more of a gut feeling: The wrong people are telling you what you should put your money into. I can't predict when it's going to happen, but last time I told people that it was going to happen before 2010. It was a guess back then, and while I was right about it, it was for the wrong reasons so I can't pat myself on the back for it. 

But yeah, people will be really wide-eyed and tell you that everything is better than ever and that a crash cannot happen ever again because everything is so great. Things are so fantastic, that even complete morons are making a killing, so how could anything be wrong? 

How indeed.",['DISH']
mu15nv,gv34bg9,stocks,comment,1618843399,"In my opinion, the best approach to take is based on risk management. As markets become more and more overvalued, the upside potential goes down while the downside risk goes up. Also, the number of good investment opportunities goes down. As this happens your portfolio will naturally start to accumulate cash as you take profits from positions that no longer have a positive future outlook while it becomes harder to reinvest the proceeds. This reduces your exposure to the overvalued markets at the same time as they are at their riskiest. So by simply making smart investment decisions and not chasing returns you should have no need to time the markets.",

mu2cni,,stocks,post,1618844061,"Coinbase Deep Dive Diligence - Financial Overview & ValuationHey All, below is some diligence on Coinbase. Would be great to crowdsource some thoughts as I never view my investment theses as impenetrable. Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company’s [S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788), website, [latest Q1 2021 report](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788), and [Meritech’s breakdown of Coinbase’s S-1.](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading)

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversialtracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of  major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.

mu2bob,,stocks,post,1618843982,"When do you cut and run?At the beginning of the year I reallocated my portfolio and recently identified a group of stocks that I’m really not happy with at all.  It represents 15% of my portfolio and is is now down (17%) year to date. I’m doing ok on the 85% of rest of my portfolio, 8% up.

I got sucked in to some hype ETF’s and tickers  that peaked around when I bought.  I did my DD and know that stonks don’t always go up.  

initially I thought I’d sit on them for a year or two, but have a bit of FOMO looking at the overall market.  Keep thinking of just cutting these losses, dumping the stocks, and re-allocating the funds to something simple like VTI or ITOT.

I keep saying oh I'm going to invest... But instead I stick to my tech based companies, like Apple, Microsoft and some others... or VTI to keep it safe.
Let's be honest, home depot isn't going anywhere, they have a strong hold on the market with respect to lumber, home renovations materials for contractors and the every day DIYers...
They have an excellent balance sheet and great financials...


So ultimate question, is it too late? Wait for a significant dip then invest? Or invest now? Or keep watching?

mtyp0u,,stocks,post,1618832243,"Valuation of Coinbase?First of all thank you to all of you out there adding great content here every day.

And now over to my question..

I have been looking into Coinbase ( COIN - Nasdaq ) after the IPO. Last year the company published earnings of $1.3B, and guiding for Q1 21 at 1.8B and net profilt $400-$500m. Currently the float is 199m stocks, at $337 making the value $67B. 

If Q1-Q4 comes in at the same EPS would be like $9-10.

The good news for COIN is that it is one of the few IPO/DPO that actually makes a profit year in/out.  The main consideration I had was do I think there is growth in this company, and I believe with the increase in Crypto and mainstream adoption becoming more apparent, there is a good chance that it will.  The multiples across the board and market are crazy and difficult to predict.  Right now, this seems to be the only crypto exchange trading on the market giving it 100% in the trading market.  I'm sure that this will change over time.  Question is, how long before other crypto exchanges try to do the same or better yet, how long before one of the big boys buy / acquire another exchange to offer their customers a direct trade option in crypto along with equities.  Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity etc. have the capital to make an acquisition, question is, will they?  I think they are waiting for regulatory clarity before dipping their toes into these markets, but once the fear goes away and clarity is provided, it just seems to make sense to have crypto access from equity trading accounts to diversify portfolios.",

Subsequent to the amendment, we issued 4,452,023 of our Class C common stock for proceeds of $304.4 million, net of issuance costs.

But many people are of the opinion that VOO and VTI are not considered substantially identical, and would be safe to use as a TLH pair. It's up to your judgement. If you're not familiar with the wash-sale rule then read up on it a bit, because it's a royal pain in the ass.",
mu03az,,stocks,post,1618837273,"Learnings from Mohnish Pabrai's Q&A Session with Indiana University Here are the learnings from Mohnish Pabrai latest Q&A

## Finding investment opportunities and when to dig deeper

As  there are more than 100,000 stocks in the world, one needs a system to  eliminate large quantities of companies in less than a few seconds or  minutes. Mohnish uses Warren Buffett’s method and asks “**Is the business in my circle of competence?**”.  This would eliminate most of the companies. Adding industries that he  doesn’t have an interest in, like US Healthcare or defense contractors,  there are suddenly fewer opportunities available. A lot of tech names  tend to be high-flyers and lose him on valuation. A company similar to  Snowflake would take him just around 15 seconds to move on.

One idea finding generator is Value Investors Club,  where investors have made thousands of write-ups to create ideas. Since  there are harsh restrictions on who can post they provide a good way to  hunt and learn. Many of the write-ups and comments are very insightful.  Value Line (Note: Many libraries have an online *Value Line* subscriptions, and some even allow Non-US residents to acquire an online card) and SumZero  (Note:quite expensive) are other idea generating sources. Additionally  he receives emails that contain investment ideas. Going through all  those, some of the companies stick out and he spends more time with  them. The objective is to quickly eliminate them. Saying no in 15  seconds is great, a minute is good. **To become a good investor one needs to be good at saying no**. The investment idea should be so compelling to convince a very deep skeptic, then one can dig deeper into the company. 

Looking  through the filings can give great insight into a business. Management  over- or under-delivering on their promises made five to ten years ago,  gives invaluable understanding of the company. It is a mixture of a  treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle. You have pieces and ideas on why a  company looks interesting looking for evidence that confirms and denies  that. He often looks at flimsy reasons to stop doing his research. 

There are times where he looks at a company for three days and then finds a reason to move on. **As  you learn a lot about the industry and the company one shouldn’t be  discouraged to discard an idea, even if it took long to research.**

&#x200B;

## Circle of competence and diversification

**One should never compromise the circle of competence in the name of diversification**.  Most entrepreneurs like Sam Walton (founder of Walmart) aren’t  diversified for their whole lives and aren’t plagued by sleepless  nights. Charlie Munger’s friend John Arillaga only invests in a two mile  radius close to the Sanford campus, yet he is a billionaire. His circle  of competence is restricted to real estate in a specific geography, but  that doesn’t stop him from doing well. If you only understand a single  industry, and your competence is solid, a focus on two or three stocks  is enough. Don’t compromise to become diversified. 

As he handles  other people's money he never puts more than 10% into one position and  he is historically unwilling to cut positions back. After a big run up,  there were times where two stocks made over 70% of the portfolio.  Mohnish doesn’t like to cut the flowers and water the weeds (originally  coined by Peter Lynch). Instead of cutting positions in the name of  “risk management” he carefully looks at the business and what makes most  sense in this situation. 

In his personal portfolio he is even  more concentrated, hardly ever having more than three stocks and  sometimes only one. There are not many ideas that you understand and are  priced well. 

Many would lose sleep being as concentrated as he is. **An investor needs to do what gives him comfort,yet maximizes the potential returns**. 

 

## Knowing where to draw the edges of your circle

**To ask the question is to answer it**.  If you ask yourself if it is in your circle of competence, or chances  are high it isn’t, if you have to question your business valuation it is  outside of your circle of competence. If you are competent, valuation  and the soundness of the business will be very apparent. Staying dead  center in your circle of competence is important. As there is no clear  boundary between confidence and incompetence, as you get closer to the  edges your risk factor increases. Mohnish says he doesn’t understand 99%  of all stocks, you just need to understand a few things well. 

 

## Expanding the circle of competence

In his book, he had to  research the shipping industry in order to make an investment. He was  intrigued by the industry as it isn’t very complicated. He was  especially interested in large crude carriers and started to read about  the industry and companies inside it. **To grasp how the industry functions, he used a mental model from an industry he already knew**.  In commercial real estate building office towers take around 4-6 years  to build. When the market is tight and rents are rising, lots of  projects are started at a similar time. As the towers get ready at the  same time it causes an oversupply, creating a boom and bust circle. The  same happens to large crude carriers, but on steroids. There are only a  few places that built them and it takes at least three years to deliver  them. Understanding the dynamics on how daily rates are determined and  how you couldn’t instantly expand the fleet was important. Learning  about different industries and businesses is always interesting, if you  can get a deep enough understanding to make an investment is another  question. One needs to learn enough to understand the dynamics of both  the industry and the business. 

Mohnish at the time was looking at  Frontline, one of the largest crude carrier operators in the world. As  100% of their fleet was on the spot market the dynamic of widely  fluctuating daily shipping rates (sometimes in the order of 50:1),  greatly influenced the company. After the Exxon Valdez there were a new  set of regulations that all new ships need to be double hulled. Ships  that were built before that were single hulled and were rented out for  lower rates. As the demand for oil went down, rates collapsed and the  delta between single and double hulls disappeared. This resulted in the  ship operators scraping the old ships. If inevitably oil demand rises  again, rates fluctuate more widely than the price of bitcoin, going from  $10,000 to $200,000 in a matter of just three weeks. Looking at the  business and the fleet, he knew that the liquidation value in a fire  sale was around $8 a share, while the stock was $5. He invested 10% of  the fund and in just a few months it went up to $11. Patting himself on  the back, he exited the position. As he looked at the company one year  latter the price was at $150. He missed the ride, because the market  went from fear to euphoria, while his thesis was just not losing money. **Being savvy about euphoria and greed is important in investing** and often having a small position to capture that pop at the other end can be beneficial. 

&#x200B;

## Emerging and Efficient markets

Efficiency doesn’t depend if  the market is developed, emerging or declining. There are, were and will  be times where the US market is extremely inefficient. As today’s  inefficiencies of the US market are on the side of being overvalued, he  looks in different corners on the globe. Today there are very few  undervalued names that have the significant discounts he looks for.  Mohnish wants to buy something that is worth $10 and selling for $4.  Different countries are at different points of the inefficiency circle.  Taking advantage of those cycles and markets outside of the US can be a  huge advantage for an investor. 

&#x200B;

## On Shorting

While mathematically it looks nice to reduce  potential returns in a falling market and create alpha, there are very  few who can do it well. As the Forbes 400 is dominated by people who are  long only and non-diversified like the Walton family, Bill Gates or  Jeff Bezos, Mohnish isn’t interested in shorting. 

To be good at  shorting, one has to be competent as risk management. If one shorts  Tesla at $50 dollars, you need to cut your position by 10% if it rises  to $100 and if it goes down, you need to increase your short position -  else you risk losing too much. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger had  short candidates and were right on the company, but often horribly wrong  about the timing. **Since you need to get both timing and the business correct it is much easier to make money on the long side**.  When you have a short position you always need to know what the market  does. As Mohnish has no leverage and no short positions it is irrelevant  what happens today, tomorrow or even next month to the share price of  the company. The only thing he has to worry about is if the company gets  better each year. 

 

## How long to hold a stock?

In a book from 1972 “100 to 1 in  the Stock Market” by Thomas Phelps there was a sentence that said that  every sell decision you make is to acknowledge an investing mistake. In a  Utopia you would only hold investments that compound over decades at a  good rate. Those companies do exist and while it is easy to find them in  hindsight it is very hard to find them at the starting staging of the  compound curve. 

As 2020 was a year of learning for him, he had a  change in his thinking. Whereas before he tried to find dollar bills for  50 cents he now tries to find those compounders. Managing those 50 cent  stocks is tax inefficient and requires a treadmill of activity. He now  looks at the destination of the business in 10-20 years. Finding  compounders that the world hasn’t figured out yet is the holy grail of  investing. 

&#x200B;

## Checklist for companies that are great

Mohnish had Dinner  with Charlie Munger a week ago and he is doing well. Charlie often talks  about cinches (as a non-native speaker I had to look up what the hell a  cinch is: basically an easy and certain thing). So a company isn’t a  cinch when the odds are high that something destroys the company. When  Charlie says something is a cinch he know he has to back up the truck  and life will be good. Charlie Munger would probably say that Costco is a  cinch. It is hard to imagine forces that destroy Costco, to the  contrary it becomes more valuable the more stores they open. **Capitalism  is brutal, 98% of all companies go bankrupt in less than 10 years and  even the fortune 500 don’t last more than a few decades**. Just  like in nature at the end almost all of them die. While it seems like a  fool’s errand to find the exception to those inherent traits it is the  path to the promised land.

Ten years ago a friend of his analyzed  American Towers and showed up early to an analyst meeting. As he went to  the office of the CFO, he saw that the CFO was relaxing and had nothing  to do. After questioning if he had nothing to do, he answered that  everyone who wants to sell a cell phone tower has our number and we  already know what we will pay, we just have to sit and wait to acquire  it. **So if the CFO has the luxury of having his feet on the desk it is a kick-ass business**. Most businesses can’t even think to run that way and would go bankrupt in less than three month. 

In  the future he only wants to have cinches and “feet on the desk”  businesses in his portfolio. According to him, his current portfolio  only has two of those companies. As time progresses he wants to replace  his 50cent ideas with awesome companies.

The third question concerns the destination of the business. Costco  just entered China and they had to put up restrictions as the store got  mobbed. In 20 years there is the probability that there are many stores  in China and since there are more than 170 countries where Costco has no  presence, there is enough room to grow. If the DNA of the company  remains intact it looks like a cinch in 2021. 

His investment  checklist is a living and breathing document and he just recently added  those three to the moat section. He has a lot of other factors but he  won’t all list them.

* Is it a cinch?
* Is it a “feet on the desk” business?
* Where is the destination?

However  it is not difficult to come up with a good checklist. He looked at how  great investors lost money and if there were things to know before the  investment was made, that could have prevented you from doing so. Warren  Buffett’s investment in Dexter Shoes turned sour as they got decimated  by cheap overseas labor. So he added it to his checklist: 

* Is this a business that can be negatively impacted by cheap overseas labor?

 

## Valuing a business

Mohnish wants to have the cake and eat it  too. Great businesses rarely are cheap, but he still aims to buy Costco  at 3 times earnings. At the moment it is at 36 P/E, which is not bad for  a kick-ass business, but as it goes into the lower double digit range  he passes most investments.

In order to value a business one has  to take many scenarios into account. Costco has a range of future  stores, membership and profitability per store. Getting these numbers  and backtracking from there get you to a reasonable price to pay for the  company. Depending on the business and the circumstances regarding the  nature of the business one has to take different scenarios into account.  Mohnish isn’t a fan of DCF. **If you need Excel to value a business it is probably too difficult**.  In an older talk he outlines 10 commandments of investing and one of  those was “Thou shall not use Excel”. If Costco would sell at 9 times  earnings, one doesn’t need Excel to know it’s a great deal. 

I collected the ten commandments: 

* Thou shall not have an investment team (hard to have a good working relationship with an analyst) 
* Thou shall accept I shall be wrong one-third of the time
* Thou shall look for hidden 1x price-earnings stocks (based on future or hidden earnings and not shown by any screen)
* Thou shall never use Excel
* Thou shall always have a rope to climb out of the deepest well (setbacks are part of the course, learn to deal with them
* Thou shall be singularly focused (Focus on the company, not the macro
* Thou shall never short (Unlimited downside, only 100% upside)
* Thou shall not be leveraged.
* Thou shall be a shameless cloner (look for ideas from great investors, VIC…)
* Thou  shall not skim off the top (Investment Managers should only make money  when they create returns -  similar to old Buffer/Munger Partnerships) 

## Setbacks in investing

If wealth is lost - nothing is lost, if  health is lost - something is lost and if character is lost -   everything is lost. It is in the nature of investing that at least four  out of ten ideas don’t work out as you expected. Predicting the future  is hard. Nobody predicted the pandemic and even less how stock prices  would look like after a year. **The way the future unfolds is often different than one’s logic dictates.** 

Mohnish  had several zeroes. A mortgage company in 2007, a zinc recycler and  countless picks that went flat or declined somewhat. One must have the  discipline and the process to still continue and learn from those  setbacks. 

 

## Most important trait for investors

While there are many  things that are important, extreme patience is required to do well.  Business changes happen not in minutes or days, they take years. **If you love to see paint dry one is suited to be an investor**. Doing nothing and being in bliss is a great trait to have as an investor. 

## Starting a fund and career advice 

When he was a student he  had no idea what he wanted to do. The key is to work for someone you  like, admire and trust. We all have a tendency to go for the name  brands, but ask yourself what you would really like to do. Focus not  what would look good on a resume but what you would like to do and what  allows you to maximize your potential. 

Mohnish started his fund  in 1999. In the previous five years he turned 1 million to 10-14  million. As he always gave his friends stock tips they one day  approached him and asked if he could manage their money. As his priority  was keeping his friends, he guaranteed their principle and 6% a year,  above that he took a 25% cut similar to the Buffett/Munger partnership  in the 1960s. As his fund grew he knew he had to run it like a real  business. He set up another fund, with similar conditions except the  guarantee of principle. While his friends protested as he closed the  first fund, they all transferred their money to the new one. **They will swim to you in shark infested waters to invest with you, if you can create above market returns**. 

There are three requirements to start a fund: 

* Be independently wealthy
* Have a good track record
* Friends and family should be willing to let you manage their assets.

## Biggest mistake in his career

While there were many left and  right turns, the journey was good. His biggest mistake was probably in  2014, where he had the idea of a holding company that acquires insurance  companies and invests with the float. After raising 150 million in  capital buying an insurance company, and intensive learning, he realized  that his plan won’t work out. He unwinded and sold the insurance  company for a slightly higher price than what he bought it for,  returning the money. While returns for investors weren't great there  wasn’t a loss of capital. In the process he learned a lot and got a  great understanding of the insurance business.","['WAT', 'WMT', 'TSLA', 'UPS']"

mu5u5o,,stocks,post,1618853559,"Dilution resourcesAfter GME decided to dilute shares, people are still buying the stock. This is so confusing as dilution decreases the value of your ownership and should in theory be a turn off for all future investors. Despite this, people are still buying the stock, even though gamestop could issue more shares at any time.

This has me wondering. Why wouldn't companies just continually dilute their stock? There seem to be very little repercussions as dilution isn't really priced into a current offering. Many investors buy the stock on current valuation, but do not discount for the potential of future dilution. So let's say a company is worth $1000 and issues 100 shares at $10 a piece. Then, couldn't it just issue another 900 at $1 a piece? And wouldn't they then have made a profit of $9 off the original investors? Are there SEC rules or regulations that prevent this?

This has me wondering why anyone would ever buy stocks if their number can be infinitely inflated. Also, I wonder why non-dilutable shares are not the norm. Maybe there are reputable companies with a history of not diluting their stock (Is there a database where one could check for past stock dilution for every publicly listed company?). Even if that is the case, I don't get why I should take the company at their word and not get a contractual agreement for non-dilutable ownership of that company.",

Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly-traded (NASDAQ: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company primarily dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for people with chronic hepatitis B virus (""HBV"") infection. We are advancing multiple drug product candidates that may be combined into a potentially curative regimen for chronic HBV infection. Arbutus has also initiated a drug discovery and development effort for treating coronaviruses (including COVID-19).  

On February 21, 2018, Moderna launched its own preemptive attack on Arbutus’ patents, Moderna filed a petition for inter partes review (IPR) against Arbutus’ U.S. Patent No. 9,404,127.  On March 5, 2018, Moderna filed another IPR against Arbutus’ U.S. Patent No. 9,364,435.  And on January 9, 2019, Moderna filed a third IPR against Arbutus’ U.S. Patent No. 8,058,069. the IPRs indicate that Moderna is seeking leverage in its negotiations with Arbutus. Presumably, Moderna believes that if it can invalidate two of Arbutus’ patents, it can use those decisions to leverage further invalidity decisions against Arbutus’ larger portfolio of LNP patents.  Alternatively, this threat alone is likely a means by Moderna to gain leverage in its licensing discussions with Arbutus, and to negotiate down the price for a license to Arbutus’ patents.  

why did Moderna file these IPRs in the first instance?  Arbutus has not sued Moderna for patent infringement of any of the three patents challenged by Moderna.  Thus, Moderna’s choice to file the IPRs was not purely a defensive reaction to contain a lawsuit.  If that was the case, it would be harder to conclude that Moderna was particularly concerned that it was necessarily using Arbutus’ LNP technology.  

Moderna previously licensed mRNA delivery technology using LNPs from a small Canadian company called Acuitas.  Acuitas had itself acquired a license to this technology from Arbutus.  Arbutus subsequently claimed that Acuitas’ sublicense to Moderna was improper, and won a preliminary injunction in Canada against Acuitas’ sublicense.  

On July 23, 2020, Arbutus prevailed in Moderna’s third IPR challenge to one of its patents, the ‘069 patent.  Given that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate is currently one of the most promising, the question is, will Moderna’s vaccine infringe Arbutus’ patents?  Arbutus will likely, at best, have a claim to a royalty.  For Arbutus to seek an injunction against Moderna’s vaccine, it would likely have to demonstrate it is also practicing the patent.

mtb35f,,stocks,post,1618745362,"A plea for the dividendMany investors nail down ""dividend investing"" to a % number. In my opinion the current dividend yield isn't even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You're not investing in a dividend, you're investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it's profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you've taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you've collected enough dividends along the way.

Personally, I don't invest in companies which don't pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don't manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.

Some dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they've been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren't sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don't know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it's profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I'd take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.

**The dividend is what keeps things real** and I don't only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). 

By holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don't have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don't have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn't because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. 

I believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don't have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly.","['XOM', 'BLK', 'GE', 'SPGI', 'MSFT', 'KHC', 'JNJ', 'PG']"
mtb35f,guypst0,stocks,comment,1618750495,"Dividends are misleading because share buybacks do the same thing while being more tax-efficient. Many companies that don't pay dividends, buyback shares.

It's quite easy to look at the full picture by referring to the Financing Cash Flows on the Cash Flow Statement.

It shows debt repaid, dividends paid and shares repurchased. Dividends paid and shares repurchased are both capital returns to the shareholder. 

This is important because by focusing on dividends only, you're ignoring companies that always return capital via buybacks.

Look at FB, they've bought back stock for the past 4 years. The amount of shares they bought in 2020 is equivalent to 0.7% yield at current price but you don't get taxed on it.

ADBE buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to 1.1% yield.

GOOGL buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to a whopping 2.02% yield at current price. It would be >4% yield if bought in March last year.

Looking at dividends alone, TSLA and the above stocks look the same. But TSLA issues stock every year so they're complete opposites.

Companies like NVDA pay a dividend but recently they haven't been buying back stock, instead they've been issuing more stock than buying and they've taken on more debt. 

Looking at cash flow also helps you know which companies are on the net NOT returning cash to shareholders because they're diluting stock and/or adding debt to the balance sheet.

Anyway you will find many companies buyback more stock than they pay in dividends (like MSFT) so you are missing half the yield. All these companies could buyback 0 stock and instead pay it all as a dividend and their yields would jump dramatically e.g. MSFT yield would be over 2% including buybacks.

I prefer buybacks as they make more money long term.

Dividend -> Pay Tax -> Reinvest provides lower increase in ownership than company direct buybacks.","['FB', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'ADBE', 'NVDA']"

mtvyde,,stocks,post,1618819980,"Manchester United and The Super League (TSL)The Super League is on its way making $MANU a way for investors to participate.

Twelve of Europe's top soccer clubs have announced plans to form a so-called European super league, in a move that looks set to rock the foundations of the sport's top competitions, including preeminent leagues in England, Spain and Italy and extending all the way up to the World Cup.

A joint statement says the league will ultimately consist of 20 clubs and be governed by the founding clubs. Manchester United is a founding club.

**Positive:**

*  no more missing out on ""Champions League FootbalL"" aka ""The Super League""
*  more revenue (Founding clubs will receive an amount of €3.5bn solely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the Covid pandemic.)

**Negative:**

* potential ban by UEFA/FIFA
* fan revolts
* political opposition

**The future:**

Like it or not, the Super League will become an NFL-like league.In the long run, that means more money, a proper salary cap and the reduction of transfer costs. 

$MANU will start printing money.

**This is obviously not a financial advice.**

**Edit: I get it, nobody likes the idea of a super league. I still think that $manu is a good investment right now (and it is also +8% on the day)",

Post Covid, people will want to start experiencing the classic memories down memory lane and are retail traffic is poised to come back in 2021. Pennsylvania Real Estate group owns the majority of malls in PA, 18 of the core malls.

Part of their strategy is to not only continue functioning these malls, but they are selling their real estate to new housing developers building condominiums and other mixed-use components. PEI recently signed a lease with Tilt Studio for a 100,000-square-foot entertainment facility to backfill a former J.C. Penney at Magnolia Mall. It also signed a lease with Cooper University Health Care to convert the former Sears at Moorestown Mall into a specialty care facility.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers have roughly $2 trillion of excess savings due to government stimulus efforts and lower spending on travel, dining out, entertainment, etc. during the pandemic. Americans are starting to ramp up their spending. Retail sales surged in March, including an 18.3% month-over-month jump in sales at clothing and accessories stores.

Yes, a reported 18.3% increase. Just wait until the fall and holiday season, people will be shocked how packed the malls will be this year. Folks will be able to experience something they could not last December, that hectic magical feeling of shopping in a crowded mall during the holidays.

----------------------------------------------------

**PEI Announced today the following as they improved their Collections and Liquidity Flow:**

1. Rent collection rates are improving collection, as it received 119% of billed rents in Q1, up from 112% in Q4 2020 and 99% in Q3.

2. That has bolstered its liquidity profile. Upon closing of PEI's expanded credit facility, it put into place a $130M revolving line of credit. Of that, the company drew down $55M, leaving $75M of availability.

3. ""In returning to a positive cash flow profile with improved collections exceeding 100% of billed rents, we now have over $30M of cash on hand, improving our current liquidity position to over $100M,"" the company said in a statement.

----------------------------------------------------

**Other Valid Financial Information in Regards to PEI's Current Fiscal Status**

1. At present, PREIT has $90 million of future land sales under contract. It expects to close on deals worth $22 million in 2021 and $54 million in 2022.

2. PEI could sell joint venture stakes in some of its top-tier properties. For example, three years ago, Cherry Hill Mall (its best mall) was valued at $786 million by analysts at Boenning & Scattergood. Interest rates have fallen since then, which should drive cap rates lower (all else equal), partially offsetting the short-term pressure on NOI and the greater risk premium that investors may demand for mall investments.",

Their preferred stock has a par value \[price that the original stock was issued at\] of $25 and is currently selling for $9.28.

mtgzii,,stocks,post,1618766105,"DD Update on RFP: How Lumber’s Best Price Performer is Looking After a 60% Surge in the Last MonthI posted a DD on RFP a month ago.  Since then this stock has surged almost 60%, including an epic 15% jump last Friday when the housing starts numbers were published and showed massive increase in construction since February; which I said it would a month ago.  

I’ve been getting a lot of messages recently asking if this stock is still worth buying or what’s my PT.  I am not going to suggest a PT or tell anyone whether they should buy this stock or when to sell if they bought it.  Everyone has their own risk tolerance and investing style.  

However, I am willing share the main data points (positive and negative) that I have so far focused on which will explain why I haven’t sold any of my shares yet, nor plan to in the next few weeks.  If you see flaws in the data/analysis, please share.  I am not a financial analyst.  I can’t give you advice.  I am just going to share with you why I am still sticking with this stock.  

**Brief History Description**

If you want a brief history description on this company, you can go to [my old DD on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/)

The only thing I will add: here’s a [very recent interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-04-15/lumber-prices-are-rising-like-i-have-never-seen-before-stinson-dean-video) from a lumber distributor/trader giving a good interview on why lumber is so high, and will continue to be high for a while.  If you look at analyst projections for the major homebuilders, like LEN, DHI, TOL, etc… they all expect the homebuilders to see continuously increasing earnings for this year and 2022.  If they plan on building like crazy for the foreseeable future, that’s great news for companies like RFP.

**Present Day Conditions**

YTD RFP is up 126% and 812% for the year.  As with any stock, the higher it climbs, the more you should expect resistance (little dips) from profit taking.  There may be a dip on Monday after last Friday’s insane rally.  When I posted in March that this was an undervalued stock, there were many people saying the lumber surge was over and the stock had peaked.  They were wrong :). Now let’s look at what’s changed in the last 30 days now that the stock is up 60% since then.

**Bear Case Considerations**

I want to start with possible downsides to consider.  First, this stock is almost now trading at its 5 year high  (Current price – 14.78; 5-year High was 15.50 in 2018).  The stock hasn’t traded in the 20s and 30s in over a half a decade.  So expect more turbulence and resistance on the way there.

Second, this is a cyclical stock.  Cyclicals do great until they don’t.  This stock will likely start a decline right before the decline in earnings shows up in an earnings statement.  A great analogy for exit strategies on cyclicals is: You want to leave the party while you’re still having fun.  To see a great example this, look at RFP’s stock price trajectory in Fall 2018, right before it’s Q3 earnings announcement on November 2, 2018.  Q3 was its best earnings for the year, but the stock was already declining from its 52WK high because lumber and wood pulp prices were crashing prior to that November announcement.  

Third, the trailing PE is now ~135.  So there is absolutely some futures earning priced in at this point.  However, for reason’s I’ll explain later, this PE is very misleading because of an accounting quirk from Q4 2020. 

Four, dimensional lumber already has surged over 300% to ~ $1200-1300 MBF in the cash markets.  While those prices may surge a tiny bit more in the next couple months, it’s highly unlikely that there will be much more growth in price; a very important consideration for a cyclical stock.

Fifth, who the heck knows what Covid still has in store, if anything.  There was a recent lockdown order for Ontario (where some RFP facilities are) due to a spike in Covid cases.  Things like this could cut into RFP’s bottom line.  Hard to say how much if at all.

Sixth, they still have some pension liabilities that need to be paid for and will certainly mute the full impact of earnings (meaning less re-investment or less dividend potential) until these liabilities are fully paid off.  These pension liabilities could be a major factor decreasing the perceived fair value of the stock in the eyes of the institutional investors/HF’s.

**Why The Bear Case Doesn’t Scare Me Yet**

1)	I like Peter Lynch’s perspective that past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance.  800% growth doesn’t mean it will stop growing nor does it mean the stock will continue to grow.  What matters is whether the future earnings coming down the road justify further growth.  If they do, stay the course.

2)	While the pattern of cyclicals means there will be a peak and a drop from that peak, what’s different with this particular company is that it was trading at ridiculous lows, and if they finish paying off their debt this year (which I think they will), that combined with the improvements they’ve made in 2020 and 2021, the resting run rate of this stock has a good chance of being higher than it was before this cycle started.  If it does, and you ask me how much higher will than normal run rate be? I have no fucking clue.  Anyone who claims to is talking out of their ass. 

3)	The trailing PE is high, and a good portion of Q1 earnings is priced in, but I don’t think it’s fully priced in for two reasons.  First, in Q4 RFP did an $80 Million writeoff for the idling of two newsprint mills—a one-time accounting expense that wasn’t a literal cash expenditure—which put them in the negative for that quarter and a EPS of 10 cents for 2020.  *If you remove that write off, their current PE would be in the ballpark of 13-14.*  

Second, Q1’s average projected EPS is $1.66.  I think they will beat it, but let’s say they don’t.  Then the trailing EPS will be $1.77 and give you a PE of 8.3 at the current price.  If you go for the adjusted PE that doesn’t include the writeoff, that would make the trailing EPS about ~$2.77 which would give an adjusted TTM PE of 5.33 at current price.  So, either way the company is still undervalued when Q1 earnings gets added in.

4)	Dimensional lumber will probably hit its peak in the next couple months.  That being said, because of what’s driving this massive surge in prices (massive growth in housing construction and remodeling), unlike in 2018, I don’t think the price will drop fast after it hits the peak.  Consistent with that, if you look at [dimensional lumber futures here]( https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#), you can see that the futures market right now is expecting lumber to stay 2-3x it’s 2019 price for the rest of year, and possibly into 2022.

**Current Valuation Metrics compared to other Lumber Players**

Even with the awesome rally in the last month, here’s RFP valuation ratios

    RFP
    P/E			    135
    Forward P/E		3.86
    Price/Sales		  .42
    Price/Book		1.19
    Price/Cash flow	6.57

Now let’s compare RFP’s ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, IFSPF and CFPZF) ([Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/syWoh0F)):

    Forestry/Lumber Avg
    P/E			      15.2
    Forward P/E		  10.1
    Price/Sales		  2.1
    Price/Book	       4.4
    Price/Cash flow	  11.4
		
Takeaways: 1) RFP *still* has the best forward PE, price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book ratio. 2) It has the highest trailing PE, but again, if you remove the newsprint mill write-off, it is actually sitting right below the average, 3) Interfor and Canfor have slightly better price-to-cashflow, but RFP is substantially better than WY, WFG, and LPX.  Overall, RFP still has the best overall ratio picture and best forward-looking position, even after this 60% rally.

**The Bullish Case for 2021**

I am not going repeat what I wrote in the last post.  To see the things I listed to support a bull case a month ago, [here’s the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/)


*Future Lumber outlook has dramatically improved but analysts haven’t yet accounted for it.*

Myself and other RFP longs have been banging our heads for months now, because the 4 analysts who cover RFP so far still refuse to acknowledge the complete reality of the surge in lumber prices.  [Here’s a snapshot of average analyst quarterly EPS projections for 2021]( https://imgur.com/a/qepFiqC).  If you look up the other lumber stocks, they make all the same projections of mediocre Q2 and then Q3/Q4 dropping off hard.  

The issue is that the avg lumber price for Q1 will probably fall in the ballpark of 800-950.  (Remember there is a 9% duty for the lumber produced in Canada).  However, the avg price for Q2 will absolutely be over $1000 MBF.  So profits from lumber should be higher in Q2 than Q1.  And given the volume and price surge for the futures in the Q3 months (July futures currently trading over $1100 MBF), Q3 will almost certainly have a higher EPS than Q1, much less the current analysts’ projections for Q3.

Also, by end of June, RFP’s three US mills they bought in 2020 should be running at full capacity according to the last earnings transcript.  At full capacity they increase the companies lumber production by ~25%.  So this only further adds to the extra sales/profit to be expect after Q2, compared to Q1.

**But here’s a decent way for you to do your own math for the value of the lumber segment:**

For RFP, assume $400 costs USD. There may be a few other costs to factor in, but not that much. May be $50 for longer shipping distances or whatnot. So, at $1000 MBF, you get about $500 cash margins.  At $1200 (which is still lower than the current cash price) you get $700 cash margins.

RFP will probably produce around 2.5 billion feet of lumber, so prices of $1000 per thousand feet let’s you do the math. I’d use a lower realization given the duty and we don’t know yet how Q4 will look.  So let’s call it $900 avg for year. So that roughly gives us margins of $450 USD per thousand feet on 2.5 billion of feet. So that’s **$1.12B in cash earnings — or about $14/share — for 2021.**  Depreciation/Amortization should take a chuck of that away so I don’t think that will be pure GAAP net income.  But still, pretty decent for a stock currently valued at $14.78, or a market cap of 1.2 billion.  *And that’s just the lumber segment.*  

So for those wondering if the party is over, ask yourself, how many companies are likely to produce their current market cap in EBITDA in the next year from just *one* of their business segments…? Food for thought on the current valuation. : )


*But Wait, there’s More!*

Putting aside all the cash the lumber segment is printing, the Paper and Pulp sectors also appear to be doing well and likely will boost profits in Q2/Q3, at a minimum.

Unfortunately, the current prices of paper and wood pulp are much more opaque and harder to preemptively track.  However, there are some limited free resources out there and they seem to show upward trajectory starting at the beginning of Q1 and continuing to grow in Q2, which means we should expect higher Paper/Pulp profits in Q2, and Q3 if trend holds.  Since it is harder for me to figure out all the drivers of this surge (beyond economy reopening and China’s ban on non-degradable single-use plastics), I don’t have the confidence to look beyond Q3 for now on these two areas.

In terms of what I use to try and get a feel for these two areas: 

1)	The closest thing to a futures market indicator for pulp. ([Shanghai Futures Market]( https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices))  The value is in yuan so you have to convert the currency yourself.  It is a relatively recent and speculative market, but it so far has generally done a decent job of acting as a mirror of the general wood pulp market.  As long as these futures are up, that’s a decent indicator of what’s currently going on in pulp world generally.

2)	There are couple of analysts who give little tidbits when companies, including RFP and its competitors, announce price increases on pulp. [I follow this editor]( https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en).  I don’t pay for his service.  But if you scroll through his feed (or search twitter for the terms “NBSK price” and “SBSK Price” you’ll see his tweets in the last few months announcing price increases to RFP’s two main types of pulp in the last few months, both by RFP and its competitors. If you do that, you’ll see big price increases being announced, many of which are effective during Q2.  So I expect Q2 and beyond to do better than Q1 in those areas as well.

3)	For Paper, this one is the hardest.  This was a [recent article]( https://www.specialtyprintcomm.com/blog/paper-market-update-paper-prices-continue-increase/) that talks about the type of paper RFP produces and that indicates prices are going up.  But beyond that, as the economy opens back up, paper profits are expected to increase from 2020 levels.  So I think this will get better over the next few quarters, compared to last year.  

Overall, it’s hard to say for sure what this means for true earnings for the year, but in terms of how I am planning my own exit strategies on this stock, I think there are major upward revisions coming to analyst projections after Q1 Earnings on April 29 and probably again during the summer, largely because lumber’s historically increased price probably isn’t going away any time soon.   


*RFP has a major additional earnings booster hiding in its financials which aren’t reflected in the valuation metrics but will be in the next few quarters*

Here’s an awesome nugget I recently realized that isn’t reflected in the valuation ratios, but I think it will help propel the book value/EV of RFP‘s earnings and the ultimate EPS.

Here’s [a screenshot of RFP’s 2020 10-K, specifically it’s deferred tax assets]( https://imgur.com/a/tzwjlhM).  If you don’t know what a deferred tax asset is, especially loss carryforwards, google it or watch a Youtube video on it.  If you don’t know what valuation allowance, it’s **very important** you look it up to understand this bit.  

Essentially, because of the massive losses RFP sustained over the last decade while it transformed itself, it has over $800 million dollars in loss carryforwards and tax credits which it can use to pay virtually no taxes on the likely 100s of millions of dollars in earnings it will generate in the immediate future.  

Here’s the real critical point, those carryforward losses largely aren’t reflected in the book value/enterprise value of the company because of that 774-million-dollar valuation allowance which was essentially a write off of those deferred tax assets. 

Meaning, as RFP starts to generate more earnings, some of that valuation allowance will likely be undone, so that the loss carryforwards can be used, and when it does, the reversal of those valuation allowances will look like extra earnings/EPS on the books. Meaning, if they remove $160 million of VA to account for the use of the same DTA’s to avoid paying taxes on 2021 earnings, that will look like an extra $2 EPS for 2021.  Given that the current enterprise value is only 1.63 billion, if the total valuation allowance was reversed tomorrow that would cause an immediate increase in their enterprise value of  47% and would look like a net income of $9.69 EPS….

RFP probably isn’t going to do it all at once but that gives you a sense of the scale of net income that will be added to RFP’s books in the coming quarters/years as they generate profits and RFP removes the valuation allowance negating the book value of the DTAs they previously wrote-off.


*If the Canadian Lumber tariff is removed, this would result in an instant windfall for RFP.*

I’ve been asked how the politics of the tariff could affect RFP.  The answer is, it would be incredible for RFP if the tariff is removed. Right now, pressure is building from the homebuilders associations and from Canada to have the US remove the 9% tariff on Canadian lumber. I have no clue when or if this will happen and won’t speculate on that issue.

BUT, if the tariff is removed, RFP gets all the money it has set aside to pay future duties.  At end of Q4, that was $243 million ([See Page 4 of their 2020 10-k]( https://www.resolutefp.com/uploadedFiles/Investors/Financial_Reports/2020_10-K_Resolute-RFP.pdf?v=1)). That comes to just over $3 of EPS, which is quite significant given that the average analyst projection for net income for the year is $4 EPS… 

**TLDR**: This stock has been kicking ass for a reason and I think will continue to do so.  I can’t predict the future, but I haven’t sold a share yet and will continue to keep a majority of my portfolio in this stock for the next 1-2 quarters *at a minimum,* because of the massive earnings they are/will be generating.  I don’t think the true future earnings of 2021 are priced in yet by analyst PTs or the current stock price.

Note:  I am not a financial advisor/analyst.  Please do your own research and make your own decisions if this company is under or overvalued.  I am sharing my thoughts with you because the mainstream financial media gives dogshit advice on how to invest in lumber.  

I’m long RFP in both shares and long term calls.  Don’t ask me for a PT, I’m not gonna give you one.  Don’t ask me if you should buy it, when you should buy it or when you should sell it.  You have to make those decisions for yourself.","['LEN', 'TWTR', 'GOOGL', 'DHI', 'WY']"

When selling stocks that have multiple buy points I believe that webull has a policy of first in/first out. So if I bought 10 shares at 20 dollars and kept buy 10 more for every dollar drop in price until 14/share for an average of 17 dollars.

Euronav Sees Demand for Supertankers Rising As Oil Output Ramps Up -- Market Talk

April 16, 2021

Belgian tanker owner Euronav NV says that dozens of new supertankers must be deployed over the coming years as oil demand and production ramp up after the Covid-19 imposed restrictions give way. Oil production from OPEC members is expected to increase by up to four million barrels a day later this year and the US EIA expects oil demand to grow by 5.6 million barrels per day in 2021 and another 3.3 million next year, which implies consumption will be back to pre pandemic levels at above 100 million barrels per day in 2022. ""This would of course underpin a recovery in demand for tankers, potentially adding demand for 80 VLCCs on the Middle East-China route alone,"" Euronav said. Ship brokers say the extra production could push daily freight rates for very large crude carriers to more than $30,000 from around $8,000 now.

&#x200B;

  

[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Google) shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Bermuda) at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=United+States) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Donald+Trump) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.","['GOOGL', 'IP']"

Hello everyone! 

Coming to the internet for a bit of a resource here.

Background: currently 24 with a full time IT sales gig, making decent money. Recently signed a lease to move in July for $985 a month. 

Financial state: Have a Roth IRA which I have already maxed out for the year. Currently have $24k in there invested into VOO, AAPL, MSFT, FUBO (questionable one I know) and ARKG. I also have an emergency fund built with Goldman Sachs with $10k in it. Additionally I have a standard account with $4k in it which I’ve used as a way of investing into riskier stocks and have fell on my face here in terms of losses.

My main question/input I’m looking for from you all is how much cash is too much to hold? I’m a big believer of making my money work for me. I currently have $15k sitting in my checking account doing nothing. Should I put another $6k-$10k into my individual account?

mtr9z7,,stocks,post,1618799729,"How can I find trade opportunities outside of market hours? (Swing Trading)Hello,

The job I currently have really does not allow me to stay on top of things in the market, as I get out of work with only a few hours left in the day and it is difficult to check the news while I'm at work (However I *can* execute trades, if I have some planned). So I am left almost exclusively with having to conduct research outside of market hours in order to find a swing trade opportunity. 

I am pretty much just lost, I don't really know of many resources I can use to find near term catalysts like a demo day, planned speech, etc. I have heard people say, ""You don't need to monitor the market and the news all the time to be successful."" However, I honestly can't apply that to my own trading in a way that makes sense to me, take the recent MSFT rally for instance, news came out at 3:00PM about the contract, and the stock subsequently rallied. To me, you had to be there, you had to be stalking a news wire.

I try to use Finviz, and don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic scanner, but when I want to find catalysts and anticipate volatility in the short term, I just don't find it incredibly useful in that regard. I also go through EDGAR filings every night, but every time I find something notable, There's just a nice gap up to a subsequent selloff the next morning.

So how *can* someone in my position (which I presume to be a lot of people) reliably find trade opportunities without stalking the news? What specific sources do you use to first find a stock or event, and do research on said stock or event during after hours? 

I am absolutely aware that there is no such thing as a guaranteed trade, I am not asking for some ticket to beat the market, all I want are better odds and a plan.","['MSFT', 'GPS']"

mtmlei,,stocks,post,1618783381,"Quick question with some backgroundAssume that there’s a stock that has been shorted into oblivion and now here exist more shorted shares than actual total shares. Now the people who shorted the stock into oblivion need to buy back all the shares multiple times over. However, since the shares shorted were synthetic, there isn’t enough money to close out of the short positions. These people then go bankrupt and hand over the bill to the DTCC. Now there are rumours that the DTCC has insurance coverage up to $60 trillion, however there is no proof of that. So the only way the shorts could be covered is by printing more money. This could then lead to hyperinflation.

Now that brings me to my question. How does one protect themselves against hyperinflation? I know about investing in real estate, commodities and treasury inflation protected securities but is there something else that can be used as a hedge against hyperinflation?

Ps. Not here to discuss if the situation above is probable or not. For the sake of the conversation, let’s just assume that it’s very unlikely. Any advice is appreciated.

mtkvnp,,stocks,post,1618778077,"With the recent dip in crypto prices across the board, tomorrow may be a great opportunity to buy Coinbase sharesFor some reason, cryptocurrency values all dropped overnight. Bitcoin for example went from $61,000 to $51,000 just yesterday and is currently trading at $56,000.

These types of dips are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world, and anyone who has been trading crypto for the last few years can attest to the volatility of crypto.

In the equity market however, these types of drastic price changes are not commonplace and typically signify some sort of impending disaster for a company. 

Given that COIN has been trading on the stock market for less than a week and that many people were already weary of how closely the price of COIN is tied to Bitcoin and the recent attention, both good and bad, to cryptocurrency, I suspect that there will be many people dumping their COIN stocks tomorrow and the price could be hit hard. Many investors may not be used to such massive price swings and may be regretting buying the company.

Personally, I don’t see this as a major deal, and I think the price of bitcoin will recover within the next month or two, and coin will as well.

Bitcoin prices routinely fluctuate like this, and this is the first time it’s happening since COIN went public. The next time this happens people won’t react to it quite as strongly, so I see this as a possible buying opportunity since this price may drop the most this time around.

So let's look at Manchester United stock first in the pre market this thing is up about 10%. 

Another Italian club called juventus is up around 12%

In 2020 Man utd made 500$ million revenue but a loss in profits because of covid. 

If This super League thing does happen Manchester United could potentially double their revenue to 1 billion dollars in a matter of 1 year.

The super League if you guys don't know about it is going to look a lot like the NBA. The most valuable team in the NBA is the golden state warriors and they are worth 4 billion dollars while Manchester United are only worth 2 billion. I believe man utd could potentially 3x or 4x in the next 10 years if the football super League does happen because football is a much bigger sport than basketball the club's will be able to make more money and uefa and FIFA won't be able to get a slice of that money this is why they don't want this new league to go ahead because they will lose alot of money also the super League will have financial backing from JP Morgan the biggest bank in the world if iam not wrong so all this is legit. 

I personally hate man utd to death 🤣 because I support Manchester city but Iam going to put rivalry aside and buy this great opportunity. I currently do own man utd and juventus through a fund but iam going to buy more of man utd.

This is basically a way of saying: Look, UCL and EL is all fun and games but it kinda of sucks we having to share our money other 36 clubs, most of them from countries with lower leagues. So... why don't we create our own league where we don't have to play them, risking embarassent if we loose and divide the profits amount us? And don't worry we will leave 5 places for the rest of the teams to have the opportunity to join in, in case you guys want to accuse us of elitism.

Now, this is the worse thing that you can do to any kind of sport that has the main target since its creation to be inclusive. Everyone, and I mean 99,99% that actually care about the sport are agaisnt. From Federations, National leagues, other clubs (like Bayern, Dortmund or FC Porto that were invited and refused), UEFA, FIFA, football players, coaches and most important the fans.

There a clubs joining that in the past few years are far from achieving good results: AC Milan, Internazionale and M. United are good examples of it. In the past years they are even having a hard time getting to UCL, yet alone win it, with clubs like Ajax, Shaktar, Roma, FC Porto, Dortmund getting the best out of them.

This is nothing but a fake coup agaisnt UEFA to gain more money, attention and get some new changes (like UCL going for 36 clubs) undone. Proof of this? Read the latest Barcelona FC press realese where they admit that they have the biggest interest in keeping conversations with UEFA and FIFA to improve the quality of already existing competitions.

Even if this goes foward there is one more isue: Some clubs have to do elections to see if this gets approved. Not shareholders elections but fans elections and that will never pass in at least 2-3 clubs.

And UEFA, FIFA and football federations won't let this go easy. They will be blocked from entering UCL and EL, but also national leagues plus they can prohibit players to go in international duty.

So, football wise... this is might be the worse decision and by far the most contested one for decades and for it to go all the way... it is a long shot.

With that said, I disagree with you when you consider that this is a good opportunity to stock up on football clubs stocks. On paper it might look like they will be victorious and they will double their revenue but... the chances of that happening are minimal

Note: I'm a football fan and this is one of the worse things that happened. I honestly feel sick just thinking about how these clubs are thinking.

$NXE  - Great trend up here; we again have a bit more to dip. But this is a weak support area, I think by Wednesday this could be PRIMED for a big move (20% potential).

&#x200B;

$PSNL - Anyone who followed me - $PSNL was my baby. It died lol. This is a clear value, and we are waiting on a higher high, but if you like value - this one is it.

$UUUU - Another one where we need a day or two - that is kind of the tune for the day it seems. Clear support here, but I want a better deal. Around $5, $UUUU becomes very enticing.",['DVN']

mt4bet,,stocks,post,1618712704,"600k portfolio, Should I be more diversified?Hello all,

Before I begin, I would like to thank each and every member of this sub for their contributions. I began my investing journey in February 2020 as a 39 yr old, newly divorced man. I guess the timing couldn’t have been better, as I’ve watched my net worth grow from 120k-600k in 14 months. My son was just born 6 weeks ago and I’ve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH. Highly speculative stocks brought me incredible returns, but now that I have a son, I think I should tone down the risk a bit. Since r/stocks and other investing subs have been so instrumental in my early stock market education, I thought I would solicit ideas to help diversify my portfolio. 

Here is what I own, after selling a bunch of spacs and a few other speculative assets. 

•Pins -13% 
•Net- 12%
•Sq- 10%
•Nike-7%
•SCHD-7%
•ENPh-5%
•Etsy-5%
•Se-5%
•Stmp-5%
•Jmia-4%
•Nvda-4%
•Crsr-3%
•Gan-3%
•Paysafe-3%
•Boeing -3%
•CNI- 3%

Cash- $25k 

I was thinking of adding Disney and JPM, but I would very much appreciate any other suggestions. Thanks again!

Edit: I probably should have told ya’ll, I added most of these positions in February when I sold my 2000 shares of GME for a life changing amount of money. I had small positions in all these stocks in 2020, but was able to add significantly to all of them once I exited GME between $200-300. My portfolio went from $186k to $600k in a matter of weeks, and I don’t play with options either. 

And most of this is in various IRA’s and an HSA. Only have $200k in a taxable brokerage account with positions I plan on holding until Powell raises rates next year or the year after. 

These are excellent suggestions regarding index funds. I will research a few and trim a lot of these or sell outright and start in index funds.","['BA', 'ETSY', 'JPM', 'NVDA', 'ENPH', 'NKE']"

mt4bet,guxg28n,stocks,comment,1618713203,">I’ve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH.

that's because the market is thousands of stocks, and you have about 15 stocks many of which are trendy/hot, and those always cool off. for example, you have zero exposure to ... insurance companies, which have been doing very well. so I think you need to beef up the holdings in ETFs or funds that cover more stocks and more sectors. I'd rather see 50% in SCHD, or options like VOO/SPY/IVV, or IWB, or VTI/VTSAX/FZROX. 

the usual recommendation is that single stocks should be more more than 10-15% of the overall portfolio. single stocks, even from the best companies, are much more volatile than a collection of hundreds or thousands of stocks.",

mt6we4,,stocks,post,1618723872,"Time to trim down marginFrom what I see going into earnings season is we have a massive move upwards in April so far, I also feel like earnings will most likely all be good. But my worry right now is good news being too priced in and it being a classic example of sell the news. I'm very bullish for this year but I think we will continue to see healthy pullbacks after each run. 

I suggest if you're like me, and use margin to a decent extent, now would be the time to take SOME of the profits and wait for a little downturn to buy more. I do not suggest at all pulling out completely because that would be stupid, this market is going up overall, but I fear margin users may have gotten too comfortable and a resurgence in volatility may happen going into may-june. 

It would be nice to see a little pullback just to pick up some good bargains, because honestly, stocks are expensive right now. So my two cents, free up some of that money to buy some dips and get right back in. If you're using leverage, take the profits it has beseeched you and wait for an opportune time to put it to work again. I think margin is a great tool in these market cycles when used wisely, and cautiously. 

I use margin so that I don't have to be too greedy with my own money, I instead can be safe with my brokers, and still get a nice slice of pie. But the risk of leveraging losses during a volatile market is something I don't want to risk.

I also am not trying to spread any fear at all, this is a bull market, but I also advise to keep a close eye on your account if you use margin and make sure that you have quality names right now. Can never get too comfortable, and when it's calm like this it is the time to be prepared, especially when you have the capitol to properly protect yourself for relatively cheap.",

mteqz3,guz8rac,stocks,comment,1618760777,"A mutual fund has a mandate to invest to a specific strategy. An active fund tries to beat it’s specified benchmark, a passive fund may try to replicate the performance of it’s benchmark or generate absolute returns.

An ETF has a lower expense because they don’t perform any active analysis to find potential investments. You, the ETF and everyone knows the composition of the S&P500, so they can run the fund on lower expenses. On the other hand, active funds (both ETFs and mutual funds) charge a higher fee since they spend more resources on analysing companies. Similar to mutual funds, ETFs have a specific mandate, but they tend to be passive i.e. try to replicate an index/benchmark.

ETFs are traded on an exchange (it’s in the name), while mutual funds are not. When you buy into a mutual fund, you buy units at the closing NAV (which you don’t know at the time of the order); on the other hand there is a market price for ETFs at which you can trade.",['SPGI']

Stocks consistently growing in the last 2 years bears no indication that the stocks will continue to grow, just about every stock grew in the past 2 years because of the money the gov't funneled into COVID relief. 

However, the answer to your question if you're referencing ETFs or relatively low risk stocks (big companies), is however much you want. The more in those ""low risk stocks"" the higher your protection against risk and the lower your possible returns (generally).

**What is Facebook?**

* Mark Zuckerberg, current CEO launched FB in 2004 and first went into IPO at roughly $38 per share on May 2012.
* Facebook's Mission: ""Our mission is to give people the power to built community and bring the world closer together.""
* Facebook wants to built engaging products to enable people to connect and share with friends, family, and groups through personal devices.

* WhatsApp
   * private messaging application used by people globally to text messages, voice messages, make voice and video calls and share a wide range of media.
* Oculus
   * Hardware, software, and developer brand centered around making products for consumers to experience virtual and mixed reality experiences to bring people together around the world to connect through virtual reality.

**How does Facebook make money?**

* revenue comes from selling advertising to marketers.
* advertisements enable marketers to reach out to individuals based on age, gender, location, interests, and user behavior.
* other revenue comes from Facebook's hardware and software products, such as Oculus.

**Pros?**

* leading social media platforms
* strong brand name
* strong advertising business
* effective marketing
* diversified business 

**Cons?**

* user privacy concerns
* most of revenue comes from advertising
* highly competitive environment
* FB banned in China, Iran, and other countries which could potentially increase FB's revenue

**Competitors? (based on the most recent info.)**

* Apple
   * According to Zuckerberg, apple is Facebook's biggest competitor.
   * apple will implement option for its users whether they want to share their information for ad-tracking
   * restricting facebook's ability to track data may impact their advertising revenues.
   * iMessage vs facebook messaging platforms
* Google
   * YouTube is leading second after Facebook for active social media users.
   * YouTube generated $6885 million of advertising revenue worldwide in Q4'20 compared to $3605 in Q4'18.
   * currently 1.78 billion YouTube users in 2019 and forecasted global users of 1.86 billion in 2021.
* Sony
   * competition in VR headsets with Oculus 

**Market Stats.**

* Roughly 65% daily active users
* 2.7 billion monthly users
* $28,072 million revenue generated in Q4'20
* $855 million revenue generated NOT from advertising

* Continuing growth from users using social media platforms and monetization from ad revenues
* social media is a popular digital activity globally to connect with people and increasings its presence through mobile device usage.

**What will the business look in the next few years?**

* I think facebook will continue to experience growth in their social media platforms as increasing number of people are accessing the internet and increasing usage of mobile phones across the world.
* I also think Oculus with their VR products could possibly expand in the near future as the video game industry is worth $60.4 billion in the US, Oculus may have the potential to expand to provide capabilities in training learnings and sharing in the healthcare business and other industries.  

**Does the business maintain a healthy balance sheet, and maintain enough cashflow?**

* FCF of $3,318 million in Q4'20 compared to FCF of $9,222 of Q4'20.
* Shares outstanding are at an average of 2.8 billion shares from 2019 to present. In the past its higher shares outstanding reached a high of 2.9 billion in September 2017.  The decreasing of shares shows that each share of stock is worth more than it was in sept. 2017 and the company is possibly buying back its share to reduce the outstanding shares.
* FCF looks strong, increasingly more FCF over the last few years.

**How does management allocate capital?**

* The management seems to do well to allocate its capital to generate a net income of $11,219 million in Q4'2020 when comparing to $6,882 in Q4'18.
* Their operating margin is at 46% in Q4'20 and also 46% in Q4'18 shows the management is maintaining a good level to utilize their cash to generate profit through their daily operations and at the same time increasing more of their net income was the same operating margin levels in Q4'18.
* Management has been consistently owned more assets than liabilities even during their early days in the market, shows that the management play it safe with their capital.

**Does the business trade at a premium or a discount?**

* Facebook's current valuation is at a PE of 30.97 compared to the average of NASDAQ PE of 34.83.
* Past PE went to a high of 90.64 and went down in 2017 and stayed consistent at PE of 20-30 range
* when comparing Facebook's PC to the past, it looks more overvalued in the past than it is today, it think today it is a relatively fair price.

* Summary
* I think with Facebook's high growth it is experiencing right now is very good since I believe social media platforms will always be around as long as the internet is here to stay. I believe Facebook has a very strong brand as they are the the biggest leader in social media platforms to create certain algorithms for users to keep them using their products. This really shows their strong-marketing skills and getting those ad revenues.  With facebook acquiring Oculus a few years ago, they can definitely expand that brand into something more than just VR but to also use it for training in business and healthcare industry. However, they do face competition with Sony's playstation VR headset but the gaming industry is definitely going to grow in the next few years. At Facebook's current valuation PE of 30.97 I think it is sustainable and its forward PE is even lower which makes me feel a little more optimistic. However, some downsides of Facebook is the highly competitive environment they are in. According to Zuckerberg, Apple is Facebook's biggest competitor as Apple will be allowing users an option whether they want to share their information for ad-tracking. This could be a problem for Facebook if they are getting less information for ad-tracking which may impact their revenues, and most of their revenues do come from ads.","['FB', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ']"

mtwjks,gv2f40d,investing,comment,1618828790,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are a bit lower this morning, with smallcaps seeing most of the selling (Russell 2000 down 0.6%). Dow Industrials are off about 0.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

It’s all about earnings today, with Coca Cola and M&T Bank due to report in the pre-market. Later we’ll have IBM, Prologis, Zions, and United Airlines.

This follows another record close for the Dow and S&P on Friday and some pretty nasty selling in cryptos over the weekend. Bitcoin dropped by about 15% before rebounding. This was all due to some unfounded rumors about the US Treasury Department looking to crackdown on cryptos. Sounds like a great stable of value.

There seems to be a bit of a wait-and-see approach in markets, which makes sense during earnings season. But there is other news affecting things. China’s back-and-forth on bitcoin is helping cryptos rebound. But then you have re-re-renewed concerns about coronavirus cases, this time in India. And hiccups with the vaccine rollout elsewhere.

Speaking of China, geopolitical concerns are something worth watching for the longer term. Probably more than coronavirus stuff.","['DOW', 'NDAQ', 'SPGI', 'IBM', 'PLD', 'MTB']"

Partial article:

Elon Musk’s internet satellite venture has spawned an unlikely alliance of competitors, regulators and experts who say the billionaire is building a near-monopoly that is threatening space safety and the environment.

The Starlink project, owned by Mr. Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. or SpaceX, is authorized to send some 12,000 satellites into orbit to beam superfast internet to every corner of the Earth. It has sought permission for another 30,000.

Now, rival companies such as Viasat Inc., VSAT +0.45% OneWeb Global Ltd., Hughes Network Systems and Boeing Co. are challenging Starlink’s space race in front of regulators in the U.S. and Europe. Some complain that Mr. Musk’s satellites are blocking their own devices’ signals and have physically endangered their fleets.

...

The critics’ main argument is that Mr. Musk’s launch-first, upgrade-later principle, which made his Tesla Inc. TSLA -3.53% electric car company a pioneer, gives priority to speed over quality, filling Earth’s already crowded orbit with satellites that may need fixing after they launch.


“SpaceX has a gung-ho approach to space,” said Chris McLaughlin, government affairs chief for rival OneWeb. “Every one of our satellites is like a Ford Focus—it does the same thing, it gets tested, it works—while Starlink satellites are like Teslas: They launch them and then they have to upgrade and fix them, or even replace them altogether,” Mr. McLaughlin said.

SpaceX didn’t respond to requests for comment.","['BA', 'TSLA']"

* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",
mu1z70,gv3e37x,investing,comment,1618847585,"Nice fundamentals.   I think COIN is probably the most compelling IPO of 2021 and the stock price could double more easily than a lot of other tickers out there.     

One question is how the stock will contend with the approval of a BTC ETF, if this occurs.   Right now, many COIN buyers want exposure to the crypto sector, but with the investor protections of a publicly traded equity.  A natural place for it is in a Roth IRA.   But, if a BTC ETF is approved (and that's a big if) wouldn't you rather have that instead?

An attractive feature of COIN's ""we sell shovels in this gold rush"" investment thesis is that buying it means you don't have to pick a winner in the crypto boom.  If BTC ends up #1, you make money, but you also make money if it's ETH, or if it's one of the touted Ethereum killers (if a coin they don't have like Solana really takes off, they will add it).   As long as cryptos are in demand, you're covered with COIN.",

mtjvlt,,investing,post,1618774981,"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

I built my own Google Sheets for my personal finances including my portfolio and trades and am currently stuck on a problem calculating the total average cost of my shares of one company. 

Example:

|Date|Action|Quantity|Price|Value|Avg Costs per Share|Total Profit|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1st Jan|Buy|3|$ 100|$ 300|$ 100|\-|
|2nd Jan|Buy|2|$ 90|$ 180|$ 96|\-|
|3rd Jan|Sell|3|$ 120|$ 360|$ 96|$ 72|
|4th Jan|Buy|3|$ 110|$ 330|?|\-|

What is the average cost per share on 4th Jan? How would the formula look like?  
Previously, I had Sum Value / Sum Quantity of all buy orders. However, this is not correct since on the 4th Jan,  I already sold the majority of the shares. 

I was also considering a ""rolling value"" of my holdings. So that on the 4th, I would have:  
($ 810 Buy - $ 360 Sell) / (5 remaining shares). But this also seems incorrect.

Maybe someone will find it usefull and i will find some new information here.  Also English its not my native language, sorry in advance for some mistakes. 

  
SPAR Group is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more. Its from their 10K.  


I screen stocks for their fundamentals and then, if i see something interesting there, iam going deeper.

**Lets see their multiples first:**

\- P/E 10,4x

\- P/B 1,1x

\- ROIC 26%

\- Net debt (- 2,7 mln $) ( they have more cash in their balance than debt).

\- Total debt/ CFO( cash flow from operations) = 1,5x. 

They have really good fundamentals and strong balance sheet. Also positive FCFF ( free cash flow to the firm).  

Their revenue  for 2020 was 230,5 mln $( 252,8 mln $ in 2019, - 9% YOY Growth). It consist of two majore sources. Revenue in United states was 92,1 mln $, International revenue 138,4 mln $.

  


| Net international revenue: | **2020** | YOY Growth |2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brazil| **49,940**|\-24%| 65,942|
|South Africa | **28,235** |4%| 27,201 |

|Total international revenue|**138,399 (59,9% of revenue)**|\-15%| 162,156  (64,1% of revenue)|

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what.",

mt2tfk,,investing,post,1618706696,"Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense InvestingI wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often.",['SPGI']

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today.

msaeih,gusgny2,investing,comment,1618620995,"I'm heavy in US Cannabis and my heaviest position is in Cresco. Just want to drop a little fundamental analysis here for you guys and expand on SAFE further. 

Bullish Arguments First: 

Currently, the Big 4 MSO's that you mentioned above are trading at a P/S ratio of near or about 7. Meaning their market caps are about 7x their 2020 Revenues. Cresco, specifically, is 6.88 P/S. To compare, CGC and APHA have a P/S of 26 and 9, respectively. MNST is a Consumer Packaged Good [CPG] that trades at about 11 P/S, although that's not a perfect comparison. I consider Cannabis a mix between Agriculture and CPG, so I chose MNST for a comparison with a more mature growth company. Now, a P/S near 7 isn't that crazy of a discount, since that's what more mature growth companies are trading near. However, that's not considering the exponential growth that each state brings in terms of sales. Each state has a TAM boost of maybe near 1-2 Billion. Each MSO had Year over Year growths of over 100% in sales. And the estimates for 2021 and 2022 remain over 100%. For example, Cresco has a 2022 estimated P/S of **2.5**. Meaning the stock price should 3-4 x to catch up to the 2022 P/S expectation. The estimates are fairly conservative, because they don't consider that the MSO's could potentially reach scale in NJ, NY, and other states that just legalized recreational cannabis. They also aren't fully considering the acquisitions being made and how they could boost revenues and the increased demand in states like Illinois (Did you see those sales numbers?! March had the highest sales OF ALL TIME). 

Talking about acquisitions, it helps lead me into my next point. The MSO's have been incredibly successful, but they've essentially had one arm tied behind their backs. They are forced to trade in Canadian markets and over the counter so their equity raises for acquisitions are heavily handicapped. They are also taxed heavy because Cannabis is linked to Section 280E. Not to mention, they don't even have access to banking yet, which is what SAFE will help with. Literally, they have cash block rooms for the IRS to collect taxes. There are a fair amount of headwinds they are running into, but they are still growing an incredible amount; not to mention that all the Big 4 are already generating positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of the Section 280 and federal handicaps they run up against.  None of the big Canadian players are generating positive EBITDA yet, for comparison, and they don't have to worry about the same federal headwinds. The problem, in my opinion, with the Canadians is Canada is one country, with population roughly equal to CA or TX, but with the entire US's worth of competition; there's also no limit on supply of Cannabis. Basic supply and demand, but more supply, less pricing power and lower the margins. The US limits licenses for legalized states so supply is topped. Illinois has the best blueprint, in my opinion, and they are being called the Silicon Valley of Weed. Just SAFE passing and getting off of [280E](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-irs-tries-to-collect-taxes-from-marijuana-companies-through-280e/) will create a massive earnings gap fill (earnings will legit near double). 

[Now what does SAFE do for us?](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/would-safe-banking-allow-msos-to-uplist-onto-major-u-s-exchanges-the-experts-weigh-in/) We already know it will pass House next week. We just need the 10 votes in Senate. There are a lot of different viewpoints on SAFE, but the most bullish is if it can help sway the US exchanges to allow for uplisting. Uplisting is the #1 catalyst we should look out for. This opens the door for institutions, ETF's, other fundies, even robinhooders to buy the stock. Right now I think most of them are buying the Canadians instead, which don't have real growth prospects in the US. They can't enter the US THC market and remain listed because it's illegal federally. So while they are doing their thing in Canada, the US MSO's are growing and scaling in key states. When it's federally legal, Canadians might try to enter, but they won't have the time or the equity to scale and compete. It sucks because they had to learn all the lessons the hard way, and now, the US names learned from their mistakes AND they get to keep the Canadians out while they grow and reach scale. It's actually quite fortunate for them the way it worked out. If Cannabis was legalized federally too quickly, the Canadians could have just used their sheer market cap to bully and acquire the US MSO's. 

I can go on all night, but I've spent a fair amount of time writing this up already. Let's briefly discuss the bearish viewpoints.

1) Congress. They could hold up legislation for Cannabis. Although SAFE is one that we should expect in 2021, decriminalization and federal legalization will take time. SAFE doesn't guarantee uplisting, but helps the % chance it can happen in 2021. Today there was news of a federal Bill that allows Veterans to carry legal medical Cannabis across illegal state lines. That's a pretty good start, if it can pass. 

2) Margin compressions. As the market for US Cannabis matures, companies will experience margin compression. Especially as more licenses are distributed. This probably doesn't happen for many years or until growth stales. 

3) ??? I'm sure there are more.

[Sources and calculation can be found in this sheet.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5yv6O6-S6IHhiGF0OAySZ6_WTO1SL1U/view)

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

In case that isn't clear enough, I would assume that the average revenue exposure of European public companies to China is >15%. I would assume >10% for US. Those revenues contribute to China GDP.

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this). If you then want to take the additional step of being overweight China equities broadly, something like VWO doesn't sound crazy.  And that step is an interesting debatable topic.",

I was thinking how in 2018 everyone was pessimistic about markets because equities were very expensive (by 2018 standards) and companies were loaded with debt. Also growth was slowing down and major companies were reporting lower earnings. Hard to believe but people were worried about Apple as it was selling less iPhones year over year. I remember we had quite a big crash in 2018 but then China saved us. Literally China saved out butts and prevented recession. Then things went as they did afterwards people were again complaining about how equities were very expensive and growth was slowing. There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that. This is very interesting and I'm so interested to see where this will end up.",['AAPL']

&#x200B;

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

msadak,,investing,post,1618600726,"AST Spacemobile ($ASTS), Lynk, and Apple all will be competing for the lucrative $40B mobile to satellite marketFull disclosure: I have a small position in $ASTS and warrant $ASTSW. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to share some info on $ASTS (AST Spacemobile) to save potential retail investors time when they do their DD. There is this idea of ""20-100x Return Or 100% Loss"" associated with $ASTS floating around, but AST Spacemobile is no $NKLA. The technology was proven to work by AST and again by Lynk. Apple is diving in this as well. AST Spacemobile the real deal with over 1000 patents, extensive satellite expertise particularly their CEO, and their own majority owned satellite subsidiarity Nanoavionics and is already cash flow positive. AST Spacemobile itself has no debt.

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

&#x200B;

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['MS', 'TWTR', 'AAPL', 'DISH', 'AMT']"

This comes on the heels of excellent bank earnings for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. thanks to record liquidity and savings.

Record revenue and earnings are likely products of a busy year of acquisitions in 2020, which included the purchase of e*trade and Eaton Vance.

As a part of a larger trend, MS looks to be undergoing a transformation, achieving most of their revenues through trading, asset/wealth management, and fees and commissions rather than investment banking and interest revenues.

mrhrgv,,investing,post,1618502557,"Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['TSLA', 'DE']"

mrow7p,gunvqlb,investing,comment,1618528650,"Keep in mind this is highly anecdotal because it's just my opinion as a pharma chemist for over 10 years now, I've worked for a couple start-ups, a couple global top 5 corporations, and a few others like generics.

I don't think the problem is our production capabilities. It's really not too difficult for me to find a job, even in a lot of rural areas. If the government really wanted to they could use the defense production act to pump out assloads of covid vaccines. The problem lies in how the industry works these days.

The big boys - Pfizer, Merck, Bayer... - don't really do much true R&D anymore, it's a better business model for them to let the small fries do that and then just buy them. They have production capabilities but they're relatively limited because they're focused on high volume of specific formulations. As far as markets go, this is the glamorous biotech/pharma wealth and risk everyone is familiar with.

But there's a middle group too, and it's huge. There are thousands of mid-sized pharma companies that usually produce either generics or less profitable out-of-patent pharmaceuticals that are anything but glamorous. This is where America's production ability lies, but the problems with tapping it all stem from the corporate... ecosystem, I guess.

The big boys have the most cutting edge patents (and if they don't they buy them, like Pfizer did with BioNTech), so getting them to share with a handful or more mid-sized companies is difficult. But if you manage that the next issue arises in the meeting of two very different worlds; big pharma and still-tiny-but-not-startup-tiny pharma. It's been going very smoothly so far though, the only problem we've seen was with the Baltimore company making J&J's vaccine.

So to try and relate this to the stock market..... I guess Biden could incentivize big pharma to share important patents with mid-sized companies? Invest in Regeneron?

Maybe there's an etf that focuses on not just mid cap, but mid-range production (volume) companies but other than that I don't see a greater than average profit without getting lucky on a stock.","['MRK', 'UPS', 'PFE']"
mrow7p,guo2tmr,investing,comment,1618532289,"I understand why the US wants to invest in generics manufacturing but it doesn’t seem like a good investment opportunity. 

Generics are very much a race to the bottom. Very slim margins and plenty of competition for abroad. The larger pharma industry is shifting towards biopharma which will make the future even harder for generics companies unless the FDA changes how biosimilars are treated.

Any suggestion for that exposure?

Problem with the healthcare/medical space is that many stocks & ETFs have already front-runned you to them and they are above the pre-covid levels. XLV/VHT/IBB are all 20-30% above pre-covid levels. You're buying into all time highs. Even ETFs that should be laggards like IHI/XHE which do the equipment have rocketed past their pre-covid highs.","['JNJ', 'MRK']"
mrmmk1,,investing,post,1618516360,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world. 

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

mrmmk1,gun9r67,investing,comment,1618518345,"Thanks for your detailed analysis of this company. I am on the other side of your trade and appreciate a good opposition. 

I think you are oversimplifying the demand component of this business. The managed care business was destroyed last year but the occupancy numbers are slowly ticking back up and will be back to normalized levels by next year. People don’t go to these facilities because they want to so the real issue was the quarantine and the lack of normal demand in the system. 

On the financial side of the equation, I think your operating revenue assumptions are also off. They got rid of the worst properties last year and most of the debt that you highlighted is long-term mortgage debt on the real estate. 

I am absolutely aware that they have some work to do but at an $85m market cap today they are easily worth 5x if they can get back on track. This is not guaranteed for sure but a great risk reward from the current price. 

Technically the chart is also disagreeing with you. Good luck in your trading (except this one).",

I have a few thoughts on this one:+ pre-covid, I was looking for long term plays in senior housing so I remember this company. I didn't think it looked like a turnaround was coming up soon and passed it by.+ having a ridiculous rally recently doesn't mean anything on its own for any stock. It just got back to it's pre-crash levels. Since it was headed down pre-crash, maybe that does make for a good short entry, but I'd still thinking of it has having come DOWN to the low 40s.- I think your thesis about the loss of old folks is unlikely to hold up. Sure, we lost a bunch of them, but there were already too many.  People are on waiting lists for years, even decades, to get into senior housing. And, we all know that housing in general has a serious supply problem that isn't going away soon.- I guess I'd say compare its fundamentals to peers and base things on that, but also no reason to start a short against short-term momentum either, so now doesn't seem like the time.",

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.

mr2m8u,gukhpf3,investing,comment,1618458682,My biggest question is while we all know coinbase makes tons of money on the way up but wouldn't they also make a ton of money on fees on the way down as people sell? The worst time would be when btc stagnates at which point the trading volume is reduced and they dont get any fees at which point hopefully they can make money from other venues. what am I missing?,

mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrepwx,guny7b8,investing,comment,1618529894,"I think DISCA might be or in the near future be undervalued due to the dump and shorts. If you're willing to hold out then it could make you some money assuming it progresses normally.

My problem with DISCA lies in a few issues:

1. I think streaming will keep growing, but likely to see downturn post-covid.

2. Restriction of content and no benefit from reopening due to it lacking a movie studio or movie production line. T has Warner. NFLX is buying up studios left and right and recently started winning awards. VIAC has Paramount. Amazon has it's in house studio and can literally buy a studio if it wanted. 

3. It would be incorrect to assume that DISCA's previous highs are a guarantee of future highs or even return to those highs. It (along with VIAC) was runned up and pump by Archegos.

4. DISCA doesn't have other business arms to keep it fighting if the streaming war continues into a battle of attrition or if a sudden price-cutting war breaks out. T brings in tons of money from mobile, internet/phone lines, trad TV, and WarnerMedia that does movies. AMZN is a company that will be around for 100 years and it's making money on everything. NFLX is the incumbent and investors gives it the benefit of the doubt as a tech company and will keep buying even if it loses money every year (unlike DISCA). VIAC has a movie studio and a host of news outlets. DIS has a multiple media empire, MCU owns the movies, has theme parks, owns HULU, and sells toys to kids. Alphabet's youtube is already cash positive and will never go away. Comcast is like T and does telecommunications, movies, and news.

5. All these companies can package their stuff with other things. I get HBOMax free with my internet from T. I've been getting NFLX for $2/month with my T-mobile plan for years now. NFLX is the most popular subscription packaged with other subscriptions that people already use. AMEX Gold and higher cards get it for free. DIS+ is the 2nd most population ""added"" free subscription. AMZN gives it's streaming free as a bonus to prime shipping membership. Comcast gives it's for free with it's telecom offerings. ***What does DISCA package it's streaming with so that it's FREE?***

6. Average number of streaming services a person/family will have is 1-3. Very few will go past 4 or even 5. Now think about where DISCA will fit when [DIS, NFLX, and AMZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_services) are there locking up the top 3. Youtube is always free with streaming as a plus. It's left to fight for the scraps among Hulu, HBOMax, Peacock, Viacom, and AppleTV & other lesser rivals.

7. Content. I don't think Discovery even has the advantage on content. [NFLX/DIS/T/VIAC all beat it in content.](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/ranking-best-original-content-streaming)

8. Moat. There's no moat in the industry. If there was one then it's NFLX's name and the ability to package other services which I mentioned in 5. We're already oversaturated BEFORE factoring new entrants both in the states, Europe, and China.

I won't tell you to NOT buy DISCA. I just think it's a small fish in a crowded and ever-tightening pool of sharks. I've been in GOOG and T for years. The only reason I don't sell T is because I'm just pocketing dividends of the TELECOM company I bought. Not for the streaming. If I were to do some pickup I'd take VIAC over DISCA. 

I am also interested on your opinion on my assessment.","['CMCSA', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'VIAC', 'DISCA', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN']"

Related party transactions and acquisitions have been a matter of habit for the Alibaba Partnership. In April 2014, Alibaba gave Simon Xie a $1 billion loan which he used to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media5 through an entity that was jointly owned by Jack Ma and Simon Xie. Alibaba claimed that they were not able to invest in Wasu Media directly because of Chinese regulations and that investing through Mr. Xie’s entity was the only way. In fact, Alibaba has regularly invested alongside Yunfeng Capital, a Shanghai based private equity company that was established by Jack Ma in 2010. The list of such related party transactions runs long and as recently as 2019 Alibaba Pictures gave a $103 million loan to struggling film studio Huayi Brothers Media in which Jack Ma has a considerable stake6. The lines between Alibaba’s shareholder interests and Jack Ma’s personal interests are very blurry, and at odds with our philosophy of backing clean and well aligned ownership structures.

Since Alibaba’s IPO, the asset base has grown tenfold from $18 billion to $185 billion or 48% per year.

However, this asset growth has mostly been driven by acquisitions and self-reported asset revaluations. Between 2014 and 2020, Alibaba has expanded their balance sheet by $92 billion in relation to equity investments (incl. goodwill recognised). In the same period, the ROAs have dropped from 26% to 13% and ROIC has fallen from 33% to 8%.

Alibaba management justifies these acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015, Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197. Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after four years in the red8.

Some of these acquisitions are in fact so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project10.",

Go to hour 9 minute 30 for his spiel as all the information is pulled from his testimony. Ticker is CRK .

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

Going to buy options around Q1 earnings date (May 4th, 2021). May the Fourth be with us research monkeys! :)",['NI']

mqu5r0,,investing,post,1618417509,"Palantir (PLTR) : today presentation is a bit weird(IT guy views):

Maybe, I don't have the full picture but it seems their products are only ""put a cool UI and automate some data tasks"".

All  the things I saw in their presentation are perfectly manageable if you  hire proper IT people. We don't need UI to prepare data from different  sources, link the data, run AI models etc. We can do it in days or weeks  not years like they are trying to sell you.

Maybe they will faciliate some tasks for companies without good sized or skilled IT teams, I dont' know...

Their  UI seems very interesting and well designed, I can give that. But I m  sure we will be quicker with a simple linux terminal (joke) :)

I  see their products like ""Channable"" for data flow management but with  all the AI hype (\*\*Channable is a small tool to prepare data to be sent  to shopping marketplaces).

Like I  said, maybe I don't have the full picture based on their presentation  and I don't know any figures related to their valuation etc. But for a  pure technical point, I don't see anything in the core plateform that is  a big whaooo effect (except their UI).

If  I need to think about a road : they maybe will be a 3d engine like  Unreal Engine or Unity but for data linking, preparation, and IA models  (the tool that groups up the techs in a simpler way).. but I have a  doubt.

Can be cool if someone has complete different views on that.",

Just a single (and possibly uninformed) perspective, but that has not been my experience working at a f100 financial services firm. We have multiple complex proprietary processing systems that we've spent tens of millions on, multiple large-scale data warehouse (each with thousands if not tens of thousands of tables), and a whole supporting cast of upstream, intermediate, and reporting systems. These systems are diverse, some proprietary, some purchased, and they have been stood up over decades. It takes our IT group many months to create or even modify integration between legacy systems. We have a small army of IT folks and have thrown an awful lot of cash at several top-tier consulting groups and none have had a magic bullet. Every RFP response promises nirvana, and all scale expectations once they open the hood understand the scale of our data issues.   

If these guys have a way to efficiently unify/link and homogenize diverse datasets, it is a very big deal and worth alot of money. Especially if they have found a way to structure unstructured data effectively, as they claim.

What are the most reccomended indicators and overlays to use when trading? Right now I mainly use SMA (100), EMA(100) for overlays and RSI and MACD as my indicators. After that I check the EPS and PER plus the EBITDA.

I think it works, but honestly I'm not knowledgeable enough to asses whether this are the most useful indicators/overlays or not, so I ask.

I’m not paying student loans right now due to the interest freeze so I could contribute $400-$500 a month probably. 

I’m a 27 year old man who lives in Ohio. I just got a raise and make $17.50 an hour which is around like 36.5k I think per year but after bonuses and OT I make in the low 40s. My fiancée is 23 F and makes $13 an hour. We both have bachelor degrees.

We don’t own a house yet, but that’s a goal within the next couple years. I live in a LCOL area so we could buy a modest home for around 150k-200k. 

I have 2k in savings, $400 in a HSA and 6.5k in my 401k. I recently started contributing 12% of my check and my company contributes 3%.

I added $100 to my robinhood account on 2/23/21 just to experiment with and as of right now it’s at $257.09 already. This quick gain has gotten me more interested in investing but not sure where to start for safer, long term investments and I’d like to put my money somewhere else other than robinhood.

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US)’s first product unveiling of 2021 will take place on April 20, the company said on Tuesday.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant dubbed the event “Spring Loaded” in a media invitation. Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business.","['FB', 'AAPL', 'TWTR']"

mquayi,,investing,post,1618417918,"Updated Paysafe DD: Medium to long term hold.Paysafe  offers a unique combination of fintech, crypto, iGaming, sports betting  and banking all rolled into one stock.  This is why NBC’s Cramer  recently said, “There is something about Paysafe that may be the  ultimate stock for this moment.” Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso  calls for $45-50 saying, “It’s the most excited I’ve been about a stock  in a long time.” So why is that?

Updated DD:

Partnered  with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch,  Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming,  etc.

Global electronic payment  platform with integrated cloud technology offering migration of eCash,  integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into  global banking as a service (with proprietary risk management enabling  mobile e-commerce for the 1.7 billion ”unbanked.”)

$58  trillion TAM.  Fund manager Cathie Wood: “Fintechs are going to gut  banks.” Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve predicts a  “$16 trillion market cap wholesale transition” of fintechs “taking over  and revolutionizing banking”

No. 1  global leader in iGaming eCash network. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market  volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected  to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

No.  2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. Owns Neteller  and Skrill, winner “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”,  “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current  ecosystems.”

No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing

Enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies)

Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Rapidly  expanding in US with new partnerships (last 3 months: Coinbase,  Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto) & new  legalized sports betting (this month: NY, WY, NH)

Trustpilot  in Europe (where more commonly used) rates Paysafe as “Excellent”  (4.7/5 stars) with over 24,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""poor"" (1.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Bill  Foley, Paysafe's Chairman of the Board, has a proven track record in  generating rapid synergistic inorganic growth. Over the last five years  Foley has grow Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X  ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS  from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those  characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with  Paysafe.”

Foley on Paysafe: “It’s  a fortress. It’s got a moat…We have a proven strategy of winning as new  global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory  risk and technical expertise…It’s going to be a land grab…I have a  vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there  first and to make sure we dominate. We’re focusing on gaming,  particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and  we’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting.”

Analyst coverage: “We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within  the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical  footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply  revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe  there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level  legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a  unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and  offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential  legalization of iGaming in the United States.""

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections and factoring in debt and dilution.
2. From  published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,  bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.  Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to  fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected  10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

Recent signals of Blackstone/CVC’s long-term hold beyond lockup expiration:

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler : “We believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

SEC filed FTAC’s Board of  Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward.”

&#x200B;

Edit:  Looking at the bear case to justify recent price action but it becomes very hard to do when Paysafe has substantially positive free cash flow at $362 million, healthy revenue growth, and strong EBITDA growth.

Even looking at a basket of the poorest performing fintechs with much slower revenue growth or even negative revenue growth, negative EBITDA and negative cash flow, the lowest possible average of that basket of multiples would put Paysafe’s share price at $15.43. There is no reasonable way to argue that Paysafe is worth even that little.

For example:

Paysign has negative revenue growth (-30.4%), negative EBITDA margin and  negative EBITDA growth, and yet it trades at a higher EV/REV multiple of 8.5X. This would put Paysafe 15% higher at $15.20.

Shift4 reported only 4.8% y-o-y rev growth, with negative  cash flow, negative EBITDA growth and much higher debt to equity but it  still trades at EV/REV of 10.6x. This puts Paysafe SP at $18.88.

Shift4's EV/EBITDA multiple of 51.56X would put Paysafe SP at $31.29.


Unlike most other fintech companies, Paysafe has very large exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, which have been very hard hit during Covid.  When we look at other brick-and-mortar payment processors like Visa and Mastercard, we can see that, during this time, Paysafe has performed extremely well by comparison:

-- Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

-- Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

The averaged EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors with negative revenue growth would put Paysafe’s share price at $25

Their EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $48




Another measure:
Fintech competitors with negative EPS:   Repay:  -0.67,  Affirm :  -2.18,  Nuvei : -1.08,   Paysign : -0.19.  Bill :  -0.62,  Shift4 : -0.43 
 
Average EV/EBITDA multiples of above would put Paysafe's SP at $69





Paysafe excluded expansion of US iGaming from its growth projections even though ”roughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe.""  Considering that an analyst with a $19 PT said, ""we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of  state-level legalization of iGaming,""  it would seem that an upgrade to growth guidance and price target is in the making. Headlines from just the last two weeks:  

1. (Paysafe partner) “Caesars Entertainment announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" 
2. ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""
3. ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

mr23mr,,investing,post,1618440740,"My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?",['TSLA']

mr3c8y,gujsw6r,investing,comment,1618445334,"If the case for equal weighted funds is so that you have more small cap exposure because small cap outperforms large cap, then it becomes a discussion on factors - specifically the size factor.

If you want more risk-adjusted return, equal weighting doesn't give you adequate exposure to the size factor.

You need a small-cap fund that filters out small-cap growth stocks, because historically they actually have a negative total return. You want a small-cap value fund ideally.

If the case for equal weighting is that you don't like FAANG and think tech is overvalued/the next tech bubble is about to burst, well, if you hold VTI and VXUS you're diversified, and that's the best you can do fundamentally. Otherwise you are moving into the realm of investor ""tastes"", which also doesn't have a good risk-adjusted return rate.",

mqy9tn,,investing,post,1618429220,"Vicinity Motor Corp/Grande West Transportation TSXV: $VMC OTC: $BUSXD - Significantly undervalued with amazing growth opportunities ahead Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&t=454s&ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.
* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting
* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.
* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.

Positions:

Currently sitting at 1886 shares at an average price of $7.73 USD

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

It assumes that after the asset price doubling (from $11 to $22), the costs to mine the same quantity of bitcoin stays constant. This may be approximately true with gold. But with bitcoin, the difficulty of mining scales with the number of miners, which in turn scales with the price of the asset to maintain an equilibrium.

So in actuality, after the asset price doubling, it is much more likely to cost $20 to mine $22 worth of bitcoin. Profit margin stays the same as just buying and holding the asset.",

mq6e0u,guf9wli,investing,comment,1618353614,"So this is oversimplified to the point of probably being inflammatory, but here I go:

Firstly, our entire economy, not just the stock market, is predicated on the assumption that growth can and must continue infinitely. All credit and lending is based on the ideal that the supply of money will grow, allowing borrowers to pay off loans with interest and still come out ahead. The stock market's pyramid-ish tendencies are therefore not a risk unique to the stock market.

Secondly, it's my opinion that the U.S. government, and the corporations it is beholden to, are simply never going to let the stock market crash long-term if they can do anything at all to prevent it. That doesn't mean the bull market is infinite, but it means that on a long enough time horizon there are only two possible things that will follow a massive crash:

1) Investors who were properly diversified, and who have the time, cash buffer, and fortitude to hold and ride out the crash will eventually regain the value they lost (which was only ever lost on paper), and investors who have capital on hand to keep buying will make even more profit. 

2) The stock market never recovers, which can only mean the U.S. government as we know it has essentially collapsed, and at that point the fact that your portfolio is worth nothing is probably not your biggest concern.

Historically recessions facilitate more transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, because even though the wealthiest lose the most during a recession initially, the effect is temporary and they still have enough liquid capital on hand to buy up a bunch of assets at a discount from sellers who are hard pressed enough for short-term cash to sell at a loss. 

Bottom line, here's the secret to success: Diversify your investments, increase your cash allocation as you approach an age where you may not have the luxury of waiting for a recovery to play out, buy assets during recessions if you can, and hope that the government doesn't allow income inequality to get bad enough that the guillotines come out.",

mq6e0u,gue3wh8,investing,comment,1618334191,"Also the ""Buffett Indicator"" uses GDP. Last years GDP was unusually and temporarily extremely low because of COVID-19. The Y/Y growth in GDP will be higher than almost any other time in our lifetimes. This will make the indicator go down without any stock price decreases.

The 10 year yield was at 5% before the dot com crash, it is at 1.63% now. If you don't think that yields play a factor in asset valuations, have a listen to the man himself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6bQPoPvCoM&ab_channel=YahooFinance

**Interviewer:**

>It suprised me when you said that you didn't think that the market was overvalued relative to historical ratios.

“NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/15/young-people-stand-to-make-dismal-returns-on-their-investments

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

1. I'm 31 years old, live in Russia - which has an effect on whole situation.
2. I work as developer. My monthly income is about 1400$, but I hope it will increase as it has been increasing before.
3. My main short-term objective is to save money, and buy a bigger house/apartment after 5-6 years.
4. I have some individual stocks right now: 2 AAPL, 1 ENPH, 2 XOM, 1 MSFT, 1 NEE, 2 PLTR, 1 TSM, 2 UAL, 1 DIS.

&#x200B;

The whole situation with my country makes any saving in local currency a joke. Even housing is not worth. In fact, with my current stocks I'm down 1% in general, but up 4% in my local currency.

There are sanctions on horizon, any time my president could do any shit, which would worsen situation for all the folks. So, I've chosen investing in world (not local) companies.

As a Russian resident I can't easily get access to a foreign broker. So, I'm pretty limited in available stocks and ETFs. My current broker is one of the 3 major Russian banks.

&#x200B;

**ETF or individual stocks?**

Maybe I should buy some ETFs, but again, which ones? There are not so much available for me - most of them are ruled by Russian banks. And I'm afraid they could collapse after sanctions or some other shit.

The only one which is semi-international is FinEx: FXUS, FXDE, FXWO and so on.

With individual stocks I'm more confident, because I'm an shareholder and present in all the required registries. So, I could restore access to my shares if something happens.

The price is less profit compared to ETF and more time spent on tracking companies.

&#x200B;

My current plan is to buy individual stocks regularly. I would chose companies from S&P500 and add some less reliable like ENPH, PLTR.

Short term plan is to buy: little oil (XOM), some cruise (like Carnival), more green energy (NEE), add no-tech companies like Walmart, McDonald's, Procter&Gamble. Also I was thinking about LHA.

So, I would like to diversify, but be more tech.","['CCL', 'WMT', 'XOM', 'MCD', 'DIS', 'SPGI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'UAL', 'NEE', 'ENPH']"
mpr7hk,,investing,post,1618273875,"Canoo Inc. (GOEV) Due Diligence  


**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Tony serves as executive chairman and founded Solera Holdings a successful company that provides risk management, asset protection software, services to the automotive industry and property insurance. He has also served as chairman for multiple other companies including Sportradar Group,Aircraft Performance Group,RocketRoute Limited, global aviation services company, and  APG Avionics LLC.

**Mark Aikman**

Mark Serves as Chief Marketing Officer and he has nearly 20 years of experience including a decade at Daimler AG.

## Ulrich Kranz

Ulrich currently serves as CEO, and has worked with the company since 2017 as the company's CTO (chief technical officer). Since 1986 Ulrich has been involved in the car business holding various leadership positions at BMW AG and caused great innovation.

**Peter Savagian**

Peter Serves as the current CTO and has held multiple different leadership positions at companies including  Ampaire, Inc, Electrified Future,Faraday&Future Inc,Sibros Technologies,and General Motors Company. Which are all companies that have to do with automobiles, electric vehicles, or technology closely related to those categories.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Some important tidbits;

>The stock had lost almost one-third of its value since Beijing launched a series of investigations into the company last November.



>The price of Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 9% in morning trading, reflecting a belief by investors and analysts that the record fine draws a line for now under Beijing's regulatory action against one of the country's tech giants.



>...noted that the regulator has made a point that it will no longer tolerate some of the hidden rules in the e-commerce economy, which makes it more difficult for companies like Alibaba to sustain their double-digit growth. But the upside is that the regulator is unlikely to impose further penalties of this scale on Alibaba in at least the next three years if Alibaba follows its instructions

mpgnog,,investing,post,1618242555,"Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023. Mobileye is working with the startup Udelv to manufacture 35,000 delivery vehicles[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023)

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”",['INTC']

mprkx9,,investing,post,1618275211,"About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM ESTOn Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

We'll know Tuesday at 8:30 AM EST. It could be interesting.",
mprkx9,gucgqvb,investing,comment,1618296862,"I don't think it's clear what the market will do in either case.

Higher than expected -> buy because you'd rather hold assets? sell because you think the fed will ease off?

Lower than expected -> buy because you think the fed will continue to print? sell because cash isn't being devalued as everyone expects?

Investing is hard man",
mprkx9,gud62bb,investing,comment,1618318523,"It was up .6% in March. What worries me so much about this is the powers that be (Powell, etc...) keep saying that they expect inflation to pick up this year, but they are sure it will be ""transitory"" or a short term thing, then it will just go away. I realize I don't know nearly as much as them, but doesn't inflation have a psychological effect, that feeds on itself? When people see prices rising quickly they change their behavior, which causes prices to rise more, etc... 

Inflation is not easy to get under control, so why are people so confident that this time will be different?",
mpllls,,investing,post,1618256463,"In-depth DD on Bio Stock Nearing Approval of Breakthrough Drug to Treat Depression: Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) 

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

**Disclaimer**: I have 400 shares at an average cost basis of $51.96.","['MS', 'CAH', 'NDAQ', 'BLK', 'MRK', 'BIO', 'PFE']"

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

In the long-term, money will flow to those firms that increase their revenues and earnings (which ultimately are able to deliver the greatest amount of cash back to their shareholders). In the short-term you might see some volatility or discrepancies but in the long-term, money follows where money is being made.

This is part of the efficient market framework that people are  so quick to dismiss. Can Tesla or Gamestop continue to have high valuations? Sure...but if they don't start making that expected future cash via increasing earnings and revenues, the market will let Elon Musk and Ryan Cohen know pretty quick.

This is why people like me always recommend a globally-diversified, low-cost index fund like VT. Money will flow wherever the cash is been made.

mohir3,,investing,post,1618104600,"Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s whyWhich is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

I'm not sure now that properties are very expensive and don't cash flow nearly as well (or, usually at all) you can expect the same safe and robust returns. 

Though owning your own home is probably a safe expense to have regardless. The equity building process can be almost like constantly putting money in a bank account pegged to inflation.

In 2021 the NFL is worth 5.7 billion dollars, all because from a few individuals has a dream and took a major gamble.

The  first real season play fpr SNPW is just about ready to just began for SNPW,

SNPW's  teams:

Medrecycler, Sun Pacific Power, Street Smart Outdoors, and   National Mechanical Group  (non glass  solar panels)  are just about done with their exhibition season and about ready  to play for real.

What the exhibition season has revealed so far about the  SNPW teams

\-  The Company’s subsidiary Medrecycler RI, Inc. continues to progress  through the regulatory process  for the approval to construct a 48,000  SF state-of-the-art pyrolysis  facility expected to process 70 tons of  medical waste per day. With approval and the completion of financing,  the project should be operational by the end of 2021

\-  One man who reviewed the tech of Medrecycler has enough faith in the   technology and business plan, that he sees fit to committed 17 MILLION   DOLLARS to buy all the Rhode Island bonds to finance the project.

\-  Many cities have shown faith in the LONG TERM VALUE of Street Smart  outdoor advertising to award them decade long contracts.  Street Smart  is expanding and adding new services to it;s product.  Geopath is  expected to support a strategy for expanding our market reach to  targeted advertisers in the OOH industry and  Atlas Transit Solutions to  collaborate on the development of a  high efficiency off grid digital  plug and play modular unit will  develop a new SMART Bus Shelter which  integrates a new software as a  service that enhances the commuters  experience while driving a new  unique and proprietary product offering

\-  The US Patient office after viewing the science  the technology   granted 5 patents o the Non-glass solar panels and the manufacturing  process for it.  UL certification for the non glass solar panels iare in  the process

\- Free agents were  signed to aid in the Durango Mexico Solar Farm team,  one a solar farm  developer the other a financial backer. Durango Mexico Solar Farm  project  currently undergoing a financial review with a selected EPC and  funding group. This partnership is targeting a financial closing and  the commencement of construction in 2021

As  the exhibition season winds down, we have a chance to evaluation what  type of play we expect to see once the real season begins.

Pre-season  tickets are cheap right now but prices will only go up once  the real season fully starts, and one  can only imagine what those tickets will be  worth after our first complete season and we get to the Super Bowl.

mo5ii4,gu1mw1u,investing,comment,1618064549,URNM - it is directly affected by the demand for uranium. It's also been doing consistently well over these last several weird weeks in the market,
mo5ii4,gu1sh4k,investing,comment,1618067465,"Nuclear power in Europe is currently declining, and I would expect it would continue to decline. There are a few nuclear reactors currently under construction in Europe (UK, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia) but they won't replace the reactors that will be closing.

However, nuclear power is growing in Asia, particularly in China and India. China is currently building a number of reactors, with plans to build many more in order to transition away from coal. Globally, nuclear energy accounts for about 10% of the energy mix and the IAEA projects that by 2050, it will account for somewhere between 6-12%.

Keep in mind that the construction of new reactors is very costly and takes a long time. Maybe there is a play there with reactor construction. The shorter term catalyst in the uranium market will be currently operating nuclear plants securing long-term contracts for supply. Prices have been depressed for a decade and continue to be below the global cost of production. Miners were slow to respond, and there was a lot of existing supply in national stockpiles that were being put into the market, but in the last few years production has been tapering off and is below global demand. At some point, power plants will have to step back into the market and sign multi-year deals to secure supply. Its worth noting as well that the cost of uranium is a pretty small part of the price of generating the power, so plants have plenty of room to pay more.

I would stick to ETFs to get broad sector coverage because it's hard to pick winners and losers. URNM was already mentioned, which is a good choice. My money is currently in URA, which is slightly more concentrated with a slightly lower fee. You're a little late to the game as money has already started to move back into the sector, but there still should be a lot of room for growth as demand picks up.

Edit: After reading a lot of the posts that have been made since I first posted, I would just like to add that this is supposed to be an investing subreddit. The OP didn't ask what you or your friends think about nuclear energy. Nor did he ask you to dream about a time when nuclear energy won't be necessary.

Nuclear power is in decline globally, but still accounts for a large part of the global power mix and is growing in some parts of the world. If you think it isn't ethical, then don't invest your money. Do I want to own Cameco stock in 100 years? No. Will I take the 60% I've made off it already, plus the potential upside of another 100% when uranium prices recover? Yes.

If you don't know about nuclear energy or uranium mining, you shouldn't talk about it on an investing sub. In 2 years, my investments in the uranium mining space have returned an average of 100%. I've sold a bit when prices peaked, but I'm still holding most because uranium prices still haven't recovered.

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”","['TSLA', 'TWTR']"

modaz8,gu3kc0d,investing,comment,1618100815,"I think this indicates the realities of running a fund that is negatively correlated with the market.  In theory it sounds like a great place to put a percentage of assets to reduce risk in a portfolio.  And right after a big crash when people look at the returns it seems even more prudent.  But deeper and deeper into a bull market, the lessons of the last crash are forgotten, the returns of such a fund look miserable compared to the general market, and people naturally pull their money out.   The nail in the coffin is bull markets are generally seven or eight years and bear markets are one or two.  It looks like a bad business model.",

mok1fb,,investing,post,1618114299,"$MHH - Value Stock in this market; my DDMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

The S&P 500 fell 0.12%, after hitting a record high of 4,130.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, or 86 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.44%.

Consumer discretionary and financials supported the broader market's move to record highs, with the latter coming under the spotlight as major banks report quarterly earnings this week.

Major Wall Street banks reporting include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Wall Street's outlook on quarterly earnings appears bullish, with cyclicals backed to show strong quarterly results.

""We anticipate S&P 500 Index earnings per share will grow by more than 30% this year with cyclical sectors such as industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, and financials leading the way,"" Wells Fargo said.

Energy stocks slipped on a retreat oil prices from session highs as investors weighed up the ongoing progress on vaccinations against ongoing Covid-19 restrictions that threaten energy demand.  

Technology started the week on the backfoot stifled by weakness in chip stocks and mixed trading among the Fab 5.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was higher.

Microsoft said it will buy speech-recognition firm Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) for $19.7 billion in a bid to boost its foray into healthcare.

""The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors at a time in which hospitals and doctors are embracing next generation AI capabilities from thought leaders such as Nuance,"" Wedbush said in a note.

In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was down 1% just days after the company urged 16 airline customers to ground its 737 Max jets, citing electrical issues. The issues, however, are not expected to cause major disruptions.

""Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note Friday.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped more than 3% after receiving an upgrade from Canaccord, citing a bullish outlook for the company's battery storage business.

Canaccord upgraded Tesla to buy from hold, and lifted its price on the company to $1,071 from $419 per share.","['DOW', 'BA', 'FB', 'TSLA', 'NDAQ', 'BAC', 'WFC', 'GS', 'SPGI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'JPM', 'AMZN']"

mopsuv,,investing,post,1618142387,"The bear case for BABA (no news is bad news)The stock is down from ATHs for good reasons due to fundamental changes to the the risk profile of the company, and uncertainties regarding the potential for future success it may have moving forward. 

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

-	Investor sentiment remains unchanged.  No new “buzz-worthy” events are coming up and no recent company news that I see promises to serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest or inflows. 

So what’s changed? Anything?

Are these assumptions correct or did I miss something? What makes BABA an attractive investment to consider now, rather than a wait-and-see story which may or may not see upside in the near- to mid-term? Or should I assume this is a dead money play for the reasons stated above. 


TL:DR 

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent. Down to flat are the trends, so they’ll continue until they have reason not to. Opportunity cost says steer clear.",

mok0m1,,investing,post,1618114213,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",
mok0m1,gu4oqfr,investing,comment,1618128647,I think this is a version of a long-short alpha strategy (or whatever) but the flaw may be that those companies may be expensive to short if the market already thinks they’re losers. Also puts may not be available.,

mobt6t,,investing,post,1618084613,"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claimsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it has found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.",

In a globalized world, there is only so much you can do to abstract away negative ESG factors from the companies you invest in. The first line company itself can try to be socially conscious, but at some point their money is going to make its way back into unethical labor, environmental, and social practices. Do they need to ship products? Do they rely on paper? Do they use energy? Where are they sourcing their paper, pens, desks/furniture and other supplies? The world is just too intertwined to avoid having your money make its way back into the hands of companies with unethical practices, and anyone who thinks that they're making a difference by looking for ESG companies are kidding themselves.

I definitely think that we should all be trying to make the world a better, more ethical place, but I don't think this is a good avenue for making that change. Invest to make money, use that money to change the world, and if you disapprove of a company's practice that you hold stock in then use your voting power to make your voice heard.",
mnvx7u,,investing,post,1618020605,"China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust CaseThe penalty is Beijing’s toughest action to date in its campaign to tighten supervision of the country’s internet Goliaths.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

mu3w35,,StockMarket,post,1618848276,"My Trading Plan Template That Made Me Consistently ProfitableIn my trading career beyond having a strategy (actually multiple depending on market state and asset class) to base my trades on nothing has ever been as important as having a Trading plan. In this post I want to share with you my personal trading plan to help you create a set of rules that will help you stick to your plan and keep your emotions in check so that you can actually follow your trading strategy and become a consistently profitable trader.

Something that was and still is key for me is the following realisation:

Never get attached to your opinion or view of why something should happen. The market is in fact always right and based on nothing but irrationality since its made by humans so the movements of the market do not have to make sense and at more times than not will not make sense.

Trading is simply a mind game. Markets are a result of mass psychology which leads to exploitable edges. Mastering your own psychology is key to keep following the strategy that defines your edge.

So now without further ado my trading plan template that has helped me so much over the years and I hope will help you as well:

**\*\*General Rules\*\***

1. Never enter a trade without a plan (TP,SL)
2. Once you are in a trade stick to the plan
3. Its ok to be wrong its not about being right its about making money
4. Be patient do not act on FOMO
5. Do not chase the market
6. Let your winners run and cut your losses short

**\*\*The 5 fundamental truths\*\***

1. Anything can happen.
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money.
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge.
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another.
5. Every moment in the market is unique.

**\*\*Rules of consistency\*\*I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE:**

1. I objectively identify my edges.
2. I have predefined risk of every trade.
3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them.

**\*\*Risk and Money Management\*\***

Do not increase the standard trade size before you doubled the account.

1. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose in a day is $XXX.

 2. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose on any single trade is $XXX.

 3. The maximum number of losing trades in a row you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is three. 

4. The maximum number of losing trades you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is five. (You may have had a win or two between losses, but there is a time to stop trading.) The maximum number of losing trades in the same direction you are allowed to take in a day before you stop trading is two.

 1. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the current price to protect a portion of those profits. 

2. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will take the money and close out the trade.

 3. If you are up $XXX for the day, you will take the rest of the day off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading

4. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the month's profits to protect a portion of those profits. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will take the rest of the month off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading! Take a vacation, sleep late and read books, or do something else fun.

I created this trading plan years ago and am only sharing it with the community now (never spent much time on social media). It is a mix of my own ideas, ideas from fellow traders and books I have read over the years. One book in particular that I highly recommend and that has hugely influenced my trading plan and journey as a trader is: Trading In The Zone from Mark Douglas.",

Since I’m a pretty impulsive person, and a very inexperienced trader, my whole portfolio consisted of tech stocks and spacs , which we all know have been going down the toilet as of late.

mu4mgz,,StockMarket,post,1618850248,"The most discussed stocks on social media last week, their sentiment and returnsHi all, many of you found this so useful last time you wanted me to post this weekly, so here itis!

For those new to this:

I have built a python algorithm that scans social media to identify which stocks are being discussed. It does this by assessing the amount a stock is mentioned, the sentiment of the chatter surrounding that stock (how positive or negative that chatter is) and the interactions surrounding that chatter (upvotes, likes, retweets etc.)

The algorithm surfaces emerging stocks by looking at which stocks have seen a regular, non-spiky increase in chatter surrounding a stock.

The algorithm tries to remove pump and dump stocks by removing stocks that have seen a single spike in chatter, and ignoring chatter by newly created or bot accounts.

It is meant to be used as a way to identify stocks early, enabling you to perform research and enter into a stock at an early stage. It has allowed me to identify opportunities such as DDD,PLUG, SRNE, PLTR and MGNA.

*Just because something appears here does not mean you should purchase it. Please do your own research beforehand!*

# Results

There are two sets of results, showing the stocks with the biggest movement in chatter, and the stocks that were talked about the most.

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.

Stocks rise and fall.

Stock falling:  
Due to sellers selling at a lower rate than market value and / or little demand and too much supply.

Stock rise:  
Buyers are willing to buy at a higher price than market value and / or high demand and too little supply.

Seeing this, how can we predict when 1 or more hedge funds, big whales are going to buy?  
It seems like a guessing game. Also the analytics are all nice parlor tricks, but unless you have the inside scoop from someone inside a hedge company or big whale you would never know. How would you?

Now these sites that claim to know etc, I think have a connection through 7 other connections to one of these hedge funds or big whales.

Think about it. We are human, we buy and sell when we need to. How would one be able to calculate when a big whale needs to relieve one of their stocks / accounts to serve another. There is no other way than knowing. Perhaps catalyst are a help to see if something will go up, but by the time you buy it since it was on the news the stocks normal price is no longer normal, but elevated.

mteym6,,StockMarket,post,1618759729,"I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results.**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/uur6fwi5ayt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f8ee2bafe16ef745dd3289826c503317135a40

Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. 

https://preview.redd.it/dcoh4td7ayt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb00595845533eba0e9dfc4769f0e1ac98a301f

Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think!

mteym6,guzdhhq,StockMarket,comment,1618763064,"The recommendations are all coming from Mad Money, which of course is aired after the market closes.  So the ""base price"" is the closing price for the day the show aired, if that correct?   So in order for an investor to achieve the same results, they would have had to buy (or sell) each stock at the close BEFORE Cramer made the recommendation?  

The investor would also, of course, have to have an unlimited source of funds: either they would have to have an infinite supply of ready cash (which of course would drag down their total return), of they would have to sell something in order to make a new purchase.  My point here is that following all of Cramer's recommendations would not result in the investor's achieving the same returns.

It's apparent that Cramer's recommendations do create a short term positive effect on the stocks, but that those effects are pretty transitory.  I admit that I don't really understand the ""Till Date"" line: it looks great, of course. But if the positive effect is pretty much worn off after one month, how can the return be so great when we're only 3.5 months into 2021?

As you may have guessed, I am not a fan of Jim Cramer. But it isn't because of WHAT he says: I just don't care for his whole hyperbolic ""schtick"". I have seen him on other shows. It's obvious that he's a very knowledgeable guy, and is capable of being very articulate. But investments should be based on logic and calmness. To me, his over the top persona is just as detrimental as Robinhood's confetti is accused of being.

Okay, JUST MY OPINION.",
mu4hgd,,StockMarket,post,1618849859,"$PEI - Undervalued Reopening Play - Deep Value DD**$PEI - Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust**

Post Covid, people will want to start experiencing the classic memories down memory lane and are retail traffic is poised to come back in 2021. Pennsylvania Real Estate group owns the majority of malls in PA, 18 of the core malls.

Part of their strategy is to not only continue functioning these malls, but they are selling their real estate to new housing developers building condominiums and other mixed-use components. PEI recently signed a lease with Tilt Studio for a 100,000-square-foot entertainment facility to backfill a former J.C. Penney at Magnolia Mall. It also signed a lease with Cooper University Health Care to convert the former Sears at Moorestown Mall into a specialty care facility.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers have roughly $2 trillion of excess savings due to government stimulus efforts and lower spending on travel, dining out, entertainment, etc. during the pandemic. Americans are starting to ramp up their spending. Retail sales surged in March, including an 18.3% month-over-month jump in sales at clothing and accessories stores.

Yes. A reported 18.3% increase. Just wait until the fall and holiday season, people will be shocked how packed the malls will be this year. Folks will be able to experience something they could not last December, that hectic magical feeling of shopping in a crowded mall during the holidays.

----------------------------------------------------

**PEI Announced today the following as they improved their Collections and Liquidity Flow:**

1. Rent collection rates are improving collection, as it received 119% of billed rents in Q1, up from 112% in Q4 2020 and 99% in Q3.

2. That has bolstered its liquidity profile. Upon closing of PEI's expanded credit facility, it put into place a $130M revolving line of credit. Of that, the company drew down $55M, leaving $75M of availability.

3. ""In returning to a positive cash flow profile with improved collections exceeding 100% of billed rents, we now have over $30M of cash on hand, improving our current liquidity position to over $100M,"" the company said in a statement.

----------------------------------------------------

**Other Valid Financial Information in Regards to PEI's Current Fiscal Status**

1. At present, PREIT has $90 million of future land sales under contract. It expects to close on deals worth $22 million in 2021 and $54 million in 2022.

2. PEI could sell joint venture stakes in some of its top-tier properties. For example, three years ago, Cherry Hill Mall (its best mall) was valued at $786 million by analysts at Boenning & Scattergood. Interest rates have fallen since then, which should drive cap rates lower (all else equal), partially offsetting the short-term pressure on NOI and the greater risk premium that investors may demand for mall investments.",

mtdj7v,,StockMarket,post,1618755113,"Predicting where the market will go. (Don’t do this at home!)Am gonna try to do something here that people say is impossible/foolish - timing the market. 

Alright, to add some nuance, I’m not going to make some bold unsubstantiated prediction and blindly stick by it. I believe as traders, or at least active investors, while being cognisant that it’s impossible to consistently predict the market week by week / day by day, it’s also good to have some sort of awareness / bias to the technicals/forces in play in the market that will allow us to react better and make better decisions to maximise our gains. 

So, this is what I personally thing how the market has a good CHANCE to move this week - either flat/chop or down. These are just some of my reasons that make me come to this conclusion. I’m very open to discussion and differing viewpoints - that’s how we learn !

1) 4th consecutive week of STRONG gains, starting to look parabolic on the charts. 

2) Not to mention, on tapering volume - weak conviction behind the move. 

3) RSI getting overbought on weekly and daily. Negative divergence setting in on the hourly. 

4) Further overextensions from our moving averages.

5) Last week, utilities were the strong leader - this may signal a more risk off stance coming into this week. 

6) Dollar index, while have been falling, are coming into an area of support, where we may see some consolidation or small bounce this week. This is the same in bond yields. Hence might see a little more pressure on equities this week.

All these stacked on top of each other, points of greater POSSIBILITIES for us seeing a temporary correction as the market catches its breath after such a strong run. Hence we might want to consider looking for some short plays / protective hedges. That being said, we all know that the market can stay overbought and irrational longer than we expect. Thus, just want to reemphasize that until we have the benefit of hindsight, we are just playing with probabilities here. 

Personally, i still believe that we will see greater highs this year, just that we need to undergo a healthy pullback for us to catch our bearings, before marching higher, and this pullback seems to be due anytime soon. Some good support targets to cover your shorts / enter longer may be the previous all time highs. 

We’ll see how the market moves by the end of the week. If it closes near all time highs again - I’m perfectly fine with being wrong. It will just increases my conviction of an incoming correction.

I know it’s impossible to predict the market but just curious...I’m no economic expert but it just seems weird that the covid crash was so short lived. I guess that was because the us gov bailed out the economy with billions in stimulus. And now the markets are at all time highs. It seems weird that after more than a year of millions dying and millions not working and productivity down because the world went into hibernation, yet the stock market and other markets immediately went so high again like nothing bad ever happened. I know the federal reserve probably did this to prevent a big depression. It just feels like an artificial high and that all of that covid terribleness will catch up finally to the markets and the free gov money will stop and then things will crash. Is it possible that something terrible can happen like covid and the gov prints lots of free money and there will never be a crash caused by this pandemic, and that a future inevitable crash will be caused by something else? Has there ever been something like this in USA history, like a great flu in USA back in like the 1900s or 1800s and the government bailing out the economy and then it crashing or the government just letting it crash without a bailout? Or maybe that covid was something that affected the whole world it is different than something that just mainly takes place in America like the housing crisis or the dot com boom? Will it be a sudden big crash or a slow downturn?

mt8gi6,,StockMarket,post,1618731969,"Why are some stocks declining in the midst of a market rally? Bagholding in a bull run.Hi,

I think we all have been noticing that despite the broad market rally in the S&P, Nasdaq, DJI, there are a certain group of stocks that have barely moved, or in fact declined. I've observed that they fall into two main categories 1) SPACs, 2) 'reddit' stocks (like NIO or PLTR off the top of my head). 

Especially when the March correction was attributed to the bond yield spike that raised fears of inflation and interest rates hikes that would devalue the future earnings of a lot of these growth stocks ,where a lot has been priced based on their uncertain future earnings. However, we have seen yields start to **cool off**, allowing tech in general to rally hard, but not the aforementioned stocks. 

So I've really been scratching my head trying to figure out, why is this the case? I've thought of / came across some ideas, and really wanna find out what other people think or whether anyone can shed some light for me.

1) Meet Kevin pointed out that SPACs may still be suffering because of **SEC investigations** into them that is generating a lot of **uncertainty**. 

2) Another thought I came across is that a lot of these stocks were propped up by retail investors using **margin**, and when the correction occurred, many got margin called and **lost their capital**. This is even more pronounced for those who had been dumping a lot of their money into call options, fueled by euphoria, and eventually got devastated when the risk they were ignoring/negligent of reared its ugly head. Essentially, the correction in those high beta stocks **wiped out** a **great deal of retail investors' capital**, leaving them with **little firepower to buy the dip**, and hence the poor performance of these stocks. 

3) It may just be a technical consequence, where these stocks had went on a **euphoric climax** (too high, too fast), and when the rug got pulled and the dust settled, its natural that they will have to take their time to find some footing before they recover in the long run. One can consider a **rotation** perspective as well where these relatively smaller growth stocks / SPACs **strongly outperformed** even the Big Boys like AAPL, AMZN and FB during the past few months. Now, its the other way around. Of course, the psychology behind this technical observation may be explained by point 2 and point 4.

4) After the sharp correction in March due to bond yields and inflation scare, not forgetting the **archegos saga**, institutions and their **risk compliance committees** may have shaken off some euphoria of their own, got reminded that such stocks have a tremendous amount of future expectations baked in (and hence **greater risk**) that would be hard of them to swallow at these prices, and adopted a more **risk-off** stance towards such stocks, rotating back into more consistent, proven and stable plays like that of Big Tech. In a nutshell, institutions are **more wary and not as willing** to enter these stocks at this point in time. 

Please let me know what you guys think. Am really trying to find a *satisfactory explanation* for myself because personally I'm holding on to quite a number of such stocks and its lowkey demoralizing to see them continue to slowly bleed even though the market pushed into ATHs. 

There are also **no fundamental changes** in most of these companies, hence I cannot find a reason for myself to sell out (the *bagholding* begins). That being said, the drop in prices in some potentially promising names have made them more **attractive** and am considering adding more to my positions (just afraid of a **further decline** caused when the broader markets start to **cool off** after their **big moves up**). 

Just want to encourage and remind everyone, that when we invest, we are investing in the **company**, not the stock. \*Insert quotes about market being a weighing machine blah blah\*. Hopefully, we can take this time to do further DD and **reinforce our convictions** towards what we hold, and then baghold **proudly** and without shame.","['DOW', 'FB', 'NDAQ', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'AMZN']"

mtg49v,,StockMarket,post,1618763367,"Zoomd Technologies TSX: ZOMD OTC: ZMDTF 

Zoomd is currently one of the most aggressive players in the martech/adtech/SaaS arena. In a nutshell, it is a digital advertising and monetization technology company that leverages onsite searches to better manage advertisers’ media budget, with monetization and conversion rates that are superior to the industry baseline.

Zoomd provides a unique one-stop-shop campaign management platform enabling publishers and advertisers to achieve superior results on wide, effective digital marketing vs. potential competition and it allows users to efficiently manage their ad spend budgets. They also launched a new full “self-serve” SaaS-based product for businesses of all sizes. Their patented NLP based technology analyzes visitor's intent and interests, thereby gaining invaluable customer information.

From a fundamentals perspective, Zoomd is well-poised within a sector--adtech--that is expected to witness double-digit growth in coming years. Moreover, Zoomd’s momentum is directly linked to the global App Install/Ad Spend market, which is expected to grow by 27% per annum. Some of the major global brands Zoomd is working with include McDonald's, Tik-Tok, SHEIN, Pango and many more. In sum, their platform has integrated more than 600 different media channels in more than 70 countries worldwide, with a maximum potential reach of more than 3.5 billion consumers!

And now onto some promising financials…

* US $4.3 million cash balance at end of Q120, with no reporting off long-term debt.
* Highly experienced management team (see the attached video for testimony from CEOs Amit Bohensky and Ofer Eitan).
* Revenue CAGR of 250% since 2017, from US $4.7M in 2017 to US $27.1M in 2019.
* Approximately 84% customer retention rate in 2019.
* Lunched SaaS-based business model in Q4 2020.

Based on my analysis (which is not financial advice but rather a personal take, do your own DD), Zoomd is a promising penny in a sector that is earmarked for serious growth in coming years. While most other analysts’ ratings are tending to neutral, I’m scooping up more ZOMD ZMDTF and holding on for expected long-term growth.",['MCD']

The etf on copper seems high right now. So I have a few questions on what I should do. First, if mining has stopped what will that do to the stock? If it does drop it's a no brainer try to buy the bottom.  But, could it possibly go higher as the demand for copper is still high even with inflated prices? 

I guess I really would like some insight to what the future price movement could do and why. I could see both scenarios playing out, but I'm pretty new to investing and I am complexed about the current situation.

mt064o,,StockMarket,post,1618697064,"Futures Trading Part I (Market Commentary and Gold futures) - 4/17/2021Hello investors,

I have been going through a recruiting process and was not able to allocate as much time into the markets recently. You can expect to see less frequent memos going forward as I'm still navigating through the recruiting.

I wanted to discuss two things today.

1. A quick update on the markets, to maintain a big-picture perspective.
2. How to trade bond and gold futures.

**1) A quick update on the markets, to maintain a big-picture perspective.**

Stocks rose to new highs, including S&P, Dow and Nasdaq.

What's notable is that the Nasdaq recovered from its ""rotation from growth to value"" correction.

📷

I mentioned in a series of market commentaries that this NASDAQ dip was most likely another buying opportunity.

3/16: 

3/29: 

What's also noteworthy is that the recovery was different for different types of stocks.

For instance, most of the names I mentioned that I felt bullish about, the growth-oriented ones, have not yet recovered to their previous highs. Examples are the following.

📷📷📷📷📷📷

As I've repeatedly mentioned before, I believe there's a value in buying these growth names at cheaper levels than before. These are businesses with strong moat and proven services trading at relatively reasonable/expensive levels.

Of course they could slip further, which will present yet another buying opportunity. Buying the dip is easy but holding it is the hard part.

**2) How to trade bond and gold futures.**

The reason why I bring this up now, which I should have done months ago, is that I see real opportunities in the two asset classes, specifically gold.

To explain futures a bit, they're really nothing more than leveraged assets.

For instance, similar to how most of the retail investors buy gold through GLD etf, gold futures represent the same thing except your position is 100x levered.

If you bought one GC (gold futures) contract, your exposure is $178,020, because GC closed at $1780.2 on Friday and it is magnified by 100x.

However, you are not actually holding $178k worth of gold futures or spending $178k to buy it. In fact, you just spent zero dollars to get $178k exposure, hence the leverage.

Although you need to maintain certain amount of cash to guarantee the futures position, it is a very minimal amount compared to the $178k exposure you're receiving.

If GC rises by 10%, or $178, then you also gain 10% on your futures, or $17,800, with minimal upfront costs.

On the other hand, if GC declines by 10%, then you also lose 10%, or $17,800.

It's very similar to options in that you get exposure to high amount of delta dollars for low upfront costs.

I personally like the leveraged feature of futures and that's why most investors use it to hedge or optimize their portfolios.

Here's CME's [page](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold_contract_specifications.html) explaining the contract specs.

📷

Similarly, ticker ZB represents 30-year Treasury bond futures. I will explain this in more detail in the next memo.

Looking at GC, gold futures turned positive in recent days and is about to test the 100 MA resistance.

I have a few reasons for gold to benefit from a new bull market. This is a position for the intermediate-term, 1-3 years.

I will walk through the reasons behind gold in the next memo after the recruiting process is over. I just wanted to throw it out there in case anyone wanted to get ahead of their positions before any big upward movements.

Thank you for reading and enjoy the weekend!","['DOW', 'SPGI', 'NDAQ', 'CME']"

**1. Understanding the career risk professional investors face can help individual investors:** professional investors often become forced sellers due to liquidity concerns, stop-losses, or bumping up against their portfolio’s risk budget. During market uncertainty, career risk hedging (i.e., not losing clients) can drive professional investors’ actions more than fundamental and/or technical analysis.

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
> From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson & Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
> So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
> That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
> # Signs of margin pressures?
> Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
> Utilities was the best performing major S&P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
> Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
> “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
> “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
> While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
> Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
> “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
> But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
> # Searching for hints of inflation
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
> “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
> He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
> The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
> Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
> Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
> “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
> # Economic rebound
> In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
> There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
> “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
> However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
> He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
> “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
> # Watching bonds
> Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
> Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
> “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
> “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

> # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

> “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

> The bull market continues, with the S&P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

> Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

> First, the S&P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&P 500 was up >10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Third, the S&P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

> Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

> After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

> The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

> Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

> # Growth a Market Cap Story

> Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

> That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

> In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

> With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

> # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

> Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

> In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

mstzdg,,StockMarket,post,1618677217,"Angle publications are scammersI have tried to get my refund from a subscription that I cancelled and the company tried to deny that I even had the subscription. Then they finally located it and said the refund cheque was in the mail since the beginning of February. And to this day nothing has showed up 
So I asked them to put a stop payment on the allegedly mailed check and issue the refund to my credit card they have on file 
Their response is that since there was no money left in my account(what account. It is a subscription) they can’t refund me because they already did 
How stupid and inept can an accounting department be when they can’t do a simple thing as to put a stop payment on a cheque and issue the refund back onto my credit card. 
My only conclusion to this is that they Angel Publishing is a scam outfit just like those butt holes that the SEC shut down Raging Bull

msuh1b,,StockMarket,post,1618678799,"Analysis: Community Health SystemsThis is my first time posting here and my first time combining my education and technical skill set to make a stock pick. Would love some feedback on if this is good analysis, anything I missed, or ways I can improve. Thanks!!

*****THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE*****
I am not licensed or trained in the field of financial advisory/equities. I am just a guy with a computer, an MBA, and a passion for data. I am an amateur. Make decisions based on my research at your own risk. Full transparency: I currently do not have an open position with this company, but will likely open a position.

TL;DR: The technicals indicate Community Health Systems (CYH) stock may be oversold and a deep dive into the company indicates that they are getting back on track after several bad years.

The company:

Community Health Systems is a Fortune 500 company based in Franklin, Tennessee. It was the largest provider of general hospital healthcare services in the United States in terms of the number of acute care facilities. In 2014, CHS had around 200 hospitals, but the number had declined to around 85 in 2021. (source: Wikipedia)

What brought this stock to my attention:
See the chart below. I had set my stock screening script to market caps between 1b and 1t with a max share price of $45. This yielded 1,346 stocks for evaluation. I ended up with about 75 stocks that then met my criteria of meeting a particular RSI threshold or Bollinger percentage. Out of those, this stock jumped out in particular since it hit both the RSI threshold and Bollinger percentage, and is in a field I am familiar with (healthcare - I work for a large hospital system). There were a few pharm-tech/biotech stocks that met my criteria; however, I personally don't like those because they can be so volatile - one clinical trial doesn't yield the results you expect, and the stock craters. This stock is in a more stable industry that I am comfortable with.

Back to the technicals - This stock closed at $10.01 on Friday, which is 17.5% below its 20-day moving average of $12.13. The stock has a Bollinger percentage of .02 and, earlier this month crossed the lower Bollinger band which would have yielded a negative percentage. This is an indicator that the stock may be oversold. Pair this with an RSI below 30 (18.6), we have another indicator that this stock is oversold. Recall, RSIs above 70 indicate overbought stocks, and below 30 indicate oversold stocks. However, RSI is not an accurate price-movement-predictor for all stocks. For this particular stock, RSI has a 55% accuracy of predicting price movement (in my opinion for things like this, over 50% accuracy is good enough, particularly when paired with other indicators).

Beyond the technicals:

Now that I had some technicals to go off of, I did a deeper dive into the company.

The Bad:
-CYH has 12b in long-term debt
-Currently has a negative Book Value to Price Share
-in 2014 CYH operated 200 hospitals, but not operates 85
-Total liabilities is 1.5b more than assets
-Growth is negative at 1.5b

The Good:
-11b in revenue and 16b in assets
-Price to book ratio is below 1 and the PE ratio is 2.29 (average PE for stocks on the S&P sits between 13 and 15)
-CYH has 1.67b in cash on hand which has been a major increase over the last 2 years
-Long term debt is high but trending down
-The balance sheet has improved consistently over the last 3 years.
-CYH has a positive free cash flow
-While growth is negative at 1.5b, growth has continually improved since being -2.14b in 2019
-Total liabilities are trending down
-Has beat earnings estimates for the past 3 quarters (next earnings release is 4/28)

Summary:

As a short-term play, CYH may beat earnings estimates again, and with the technicals indicating the stock being in oversold territory, there may be a small pop in the stock price to take advantage of. However, after diving into the company deeper, reading about the management team, and seeing the improvements over the last 2 years, this could be a good long-term healthcare play as well.",['SPGI']

msl8o9,,StockMarket,post,1618639203,"dealing with depressionHi All,  


I've started investing a year ago and have had some near opportunities to change my family's life. I had some safe picks, but also bought GME when it was 5 dollars and doge when it was .004. I sold both with a small profit, but seeing how they skyrocketed has me just so angry at myself. I could have changed my family's fortunes and not live with the day to day stress of bills coming in all the time. I've been holding onto stocks that have really been hit hard since Feb. because I don't want to make the mistake of selling again.- but now am dealing with the stress of seeing red every day while the overall market is green. I think I am building better tolerance for the volatility of the market, but when I have moments along, I just want to cry that I messed up so bad and could have done something amazing. How do you all deal with it? Would appreciate your thoughts. Sorry for the depressing post - this is hard for me to write. But I can't really talk to anyone about it.",

* There are loads, loads more opportunities than just Doge and GME

msqs33,,StockMarket,post,1618666243,"What do you think will happen to a Food Production company's stock price pre and during the US-China war?Historically, before 1940 it increase moderately, but during 1940 - 1945 the Wheat, Beef commodities went up by 50% (capped during the war). And because of the inflation it went up again between 1945 - 1948.

&#x200B;

It is based on a research journal  [Selected Commodity Prices before and after the Second World War | Download Scientific Diagram (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Selected-Commodity-Prices-before-and-after-the-Second-World-War_fig10_207258306) .

&#x200B;

============= Below this is an opinion due to the 560 minimum words post. I did not intend to write opinion.

&#x200B;

But today's war will not be like in the 1940s. Either we nuke each other or we strangle each other's economy. In other words, commodities shortage. I prefer the latter. So here I am, questioning redditors which you are going to bet pre and during the US-China war.

&#x200B;

Alright, so wheat is a basic commodities to create instant noodles, bread, porridge, cereal. While beef is well you know, a source of protein. Asians eat noodles regularly, Italian eat pasta as well. It's an essential ingredients to create food. Alright, essentials do not mean it has no substitute but supply and demand does not change easily, at least the demand part. So for a time, when the supply drops, the demand will cause a price hike. I am not sure whether this will be good for a noodle company or any company which rely on Wheat.

Because the take out or pizza person don't make any money off any them - they tip the driver - no tip ever goes to the actual person putting the food together. So the majority of managers understand this, turn it off, and just allow online orders to come through that actually tips the people working. They let the kitchen catch up before turning it back on.

msgxs1,,StockMarket,post,1618621747,"How margin and short interest rate works for those who are curious.

Short interest and Margin interest is APR and daily rates are based on trading days per year.

There are 365 days/year and 52 weekends that you cant trade on. So that brings the amount of days interest is charged on to 261. (365- 52x2) 

There are also a handful of holidays and other days the exchanges are closed so we will say 11 of those (xmas, 4july, thanksgiving, memorial, etc) so whatever the interest rate is at they are paying you divide that by 250. (261-11).

So lets say interest rate is 20% or .2
We take .2 / 250 = .0008 daily interest.
If the amount you are buying on margin is $10000you will pay $8/day interest. (10000 x .0008) 

If the shares they are shorting are worth fuck lets say 500 million then they will be paying 400k/day interest. (500mil x.0008)

The math equations without numbers look like this. 

APR / TD = DPR   

(EDIT: I was typing this on my phone and put a multiplication sign instead of a division sign thank you to u/bruceismynickname for pointing that out.)

APR= Annual Percentage Rate
TD=trading days
DPR= Daily Percentage Rate.

DPR x CoS =DDO

DPR=Daily Percentage Rate
CoS=  Average Cost of Shares
DDO= Daily Dollars Owed

Now obviously the letters I have used aren’t very mathematically oriented (my math profs would have laughed me out of their offices) but I figured those letters corresponded nicely to what they are meant to represent. If you buy on margin or are interested in finding a rough amount shorters might owe daily these equations can help you with the math.

Tilray bouncing on a big pivot and momentum about to turn up...could move to $25 before big resistance...

Option contract level P/C on Tilray now neutral (has been pretty bearish)

Aphria looking even stronger than Tilray. If it gets above $14.85 is can move to $16.28 and then even up to $19 level

Calls and puts here waging a little battle but overall premium is leaning bullish

GRWG looking like it wants to take one more stab at $50 level

GRWG options looking call heavy too..

Canopy Growth Co. looks like the same setup...been holding the major pivot for a while now.

Lastly CRON is looking strong too - held the major level (VPOC) and looking like it's momentum is about to break out higher....$9.50 would be resistance. 

https://preview.redd.it/87tajmo9mlt61.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=322d3fcd18ffc3b64d05a0e83968187b75359d2d

CRON options are looking neutral but above $9 and that could change quickly.

There are never any guarantees in trading...but these are some pretty solid setups (as far as risk/reward goes) for the Cannabis space and there is some strong call buying coming in.",

By Todd C. Frankel

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/



One month after revealing that one child died and others were injured in accidents on Peloton treadmills, the at-home exercise company is fighting a federal safety agency’s request that the company recall the products and has delayed the agency’s investigation into potential safety problems, according to officials familiar with the incident.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission this week took the unusual step of issuing an administrative subpoena to require Peloton to disclose the name of the child who died and the family’s contact information so regulators can continue an inquiry into what went wrong, according to officials who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The previously undisclosed dispute between the nation’s product safety regulator and Peloton — a $34 billion company famous for its stationary bicycles and online workouts — has so far taken place outside public view.
The two sides also are clashing over whether Peloton’s treadmills need to be taken off the market. The company and regulators have been negotiating this week over the wording and timing of an agency warning to alert consumers to potential dangers posed by the company’s Peloton Tread+ — a $4,300 exercise machine, these officials said. A new safety warning from the CPSC is expected to be posted as early as Saturday, officials said.
“This doesn’t happen with other treadmills,” said an official familiar with the case, explaining why the CPSC was alarmed by reports of victims being pulled under the machines and suffering injuries that included broken bones and head trauma. ""It is a different hazard pattern than is typically seen.”",

msbrz1,,StockMarket,post,1618604953,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 16, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 16, 2021**

Stocks traded higher on Friday, continuing momentum from yesterday’s record-setting close, with a batch of better-than-expected economic and corporate earnings results fueling the recent rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. 

According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

 ""*There's an elite group of investors that has managed to produce spectacular returns for decades, outperforming not only the market, but also corporate insiders. They're not a private equity group, or a hedge fund, or even Motley Fool subscribers. They're members of Congress. Researchers have found that between 1985 and 2001, members of the House of Representatives outperformed the market by about 6% per year (*[*PDF*](http://insidertrading.procon.org/sourcefiles/abnormal-returns-of-us-house-of-representatives-2011.pdf)*). Members of the Senate did even better, crushing market returns by more than 12% annually in the study period of 1993 to 1998 (*[*PDF*](http://insidertrading.procon.org/sourcefiles/abnormalreturnsziobrowski.pdf)*).

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

mu71ka,,wallstreetbets,post,1618856785,"No, no one knows the date or PT on the ticker you just yolo’d your rent check on thinking it’s a “squeeze.” $CLOV $GMEI find too many comments on YOLO/DD threads of people saying they need it to moon, or “I’m also in, please let me know when it’s a good time to get out,” and “I don’t want to miss the squeeze!” Instead of commenting on each of those with, “decide for yourself,” here’s this commentary from some random idiot on the internet. I’ve made 1000% gain some years, but also have lost 50% of that 1000% in days, so the fuck I know right? But, this IS financial advice. 

First off, no one knows IF there will be a squeeze on any stock. SI doesn’t equal squeeze. This is true for any stock.

Second off, you need to make all of these decisions yourself. “This is a casino” isn’t a joke. It is a casino. Sometimes fundamentals matter, sometimes they don’t. No one will ever know the peak of a squeeze, let alone if there will even be one. 

Follow DFV’s yolo posts, and you’ll realize that the squeeze was just the icing on top. He was in it for the literal “I like the stock” phrase. Not even he knew that it would squeeze so hard, he was long, and just knew the potential of a squeeze. He happened to be right, even if it took 8 of his 9 lives to get there. 

So ask yourself, does the stock that you just read “squeeze DD” on draw similarities to DFV’s DD about GameStop? Do you trust these random DD’s about CLOV that came out of no where?

DFV yolo was over a year in the making before the squeeze was ever a thing, and that squeeze was also in the making that whole time. 

If any ticker besides GME gets squeezed, it will pop faster than an teenage boy’s white head on hot day, and probably only one person in the world will sell at its absolute peak. 

(I say “besides GME” because it has such a loyal following, I believe them when they say 69,420.69 or nothing.  Maybe TSLA can be thrown in that group too)

Set a price for yourself to get out, and make sure you’ll be ok if everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Because you’ll either sell for a loss, or will have to go long, which wouldn’t be terrible if you believe in the company. 

God bless you retards that sell at the top, and Valhalla to you brothers and sisters holding without an exit strategy (whatever that is?)

I’ve held CLOV for a while, sold some for a loss, and still have some. I would love to see this thing get jacked, but don’t look for a GME 2.0, every stock is different with different dynamics. So I’m not against CLOV, but trust the squeeze like you’re going to be able to time it.

I love looking at loss porn, and wsb is the best place for it. The bets some people make are IQ level a million, others negative IQ.

But, for the love of God stop asking for dates and pt on things you spent your rent check on, most people on wsb couldn’t care less about your wallet. You have to look out for you. Lost puppies are depressing.

TLDR: PLTR is game-changing tech, has a deep moat and a huge TAM. But, the stock has been beaten down...and without any upside catalyst...will likely break the $21 support level and grind down to $15...or lower. I exited my position and have buy order at $15...all tendies will be reinvested in more PLTR shares.


AMAZING COMPANY
Much DD has been provided on WSB...so I won’t go into too much repetitive detail.
- PLTR software is potentially world-changing.
- They been developing/optimizing this software for over a decade...funded by DOD/DARPA.
- Their B2B play is just ramping-up...they’ll likely be working with 50%+ of the F500 in 5 years.
- Their competitive Moat is Challenger Deep.


UNFORTUNATELY, NO UPSIDE CATALYSTS UNTIL EARNINGS IN MAY
Lots of downside catalysts: 
- Insider Selling 
- Wall St/Pro investors still don’t fundamentally understand PLTR.
- Management shunning Wall St...not playing the quarterly results game.
- The DoubleClick Demo Day last week was a dud...a real missed opportunity...PLTR didn’t manage expectations...the presenters looked into space somewhere off camera...and awkwardly read instead of presenting the amazing tech...they also went too far into the weeds...only presented 2 client categories...and never presented PLTR client results...the stock literally dropped from $26 to $23 in a day...and is still grinding lower.


BRILLIANT UNIQUE CEO
- Love Papa Karp...and he is building a world-changing company.
- But, when the CEO literally tells people not to buy “short term”...what kind of message does this send? 
- Who wants to buy a stock and watch it grind lower without any upside catalysts?
- Pro investor have many shiny objects to chase.
- Retail investors don’t have unlimited dry powder to buy the dips.

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

* **1. About Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. BCRX, is a commercial-stage *drug developer* headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, that focuses on developing oral therapeutics for *rare diseases*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xrll4lihq2u61.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5a96be0300985c8d0ee9becdc8ab6edce5c7ad

&#x200B;

* **2. Unique staff team**

The company was founded in 1996 and is currently led by *Jon P. Stonehouse CEO*, a renowned pharmaceutical executive with over 20 years of thought leadership. Stonehouse previously served as the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Merck. Among his numerous accomplishments, Stonehouse was responsible for the game-changing acquisition of Serono S.A in 2007, the largest biotechnology company in Europe at the time.

What makes Jon Stonehouse a unique CEO is the *dedication* he has *towards patients* through his commitment to working faster in order to bring life-saving rare disease therapeutics to patient populations around the world. His passion is further substantiated by the note he had pasted on his monitor during the[ 2021 JPM Healthcare Conference](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9)

&#x200B;

* **3. Institutional ownership**

Apart from having a stellar management team, what prospective retail investors should also pay close attention to is BioCryst’s rockstar institutional investor syndicate, which includes both generalist industry stalwarts such as *State Street/BlackRock* and sector-specialist biotech funds like *Baker Brothers/Sarissa Capital*.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the *first Oral approved* treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with *hereditary angioedema (HAE)*, disease which is estimated to affect *1 in 50,000 people*.

Berotralstat is currently approved in two countries. On December the 3rd it got approved by the FDA in the *USA*, and on January the 22nd in *Japan*. The company expects approval of Orladeyo in *Europe* to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

CEO himself Jon Stonehouse confirmed in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) Orladeyo will annually be generating $500MM plus revenue.

\-Serge Belanger ( Analyst ): I think in the past you've talked about sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( CEO ): Yeah make sure you remember the plus.

&#x200B;

Before oral Orladeyo was approved for HAE, patients would only have treatments that required usage of *needles*. This dramatically reduced the *quality of their life*, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main reason why Orladeyo is a game changer.

After the approval, surveys on patients were done, showing a large number of new patients that were not treated before due to needles, now willing to be treated taking an oral form pill, Orladeyo.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 13), in their recently undergone survey 59% of the patients expressed high willingness to use Orladeyo, and that number rised to 71% with Physician recommendation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6bzzghklq2u61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c53c2b75315664ca4bdc96244a9843c40534194

&#x200B;

Additional surveys were undergone on patients using treatments from the competition ""Cynrize, Haegarda, Takhzyro"" and the results were[ the following ones](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 14).

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to 485,000$

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

The day Orladeyo received the approval in Japan, Goichi Matsuda, president of Torii said the following words ""Until now, HAE patients in Japan had no therapies approved to prevent attacks, so the approval of Orladeyo marks a significant advance in HAE treatment"", ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to bring the first oral treatment option to Japanese HAE patients and are actively preparing for the commercialization"".

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to $248,500

Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment from Torii.

BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales.

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's $248,500/year. This number should soon be confirmed.

Approval in Europe expected to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$

Japan - 500p x 248,5K  = 124,250,000$

EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of $2,628,170,000. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

\- On October 30, 2020 MHRA granted early acces for Berotralstat patients in UK

\- On March 11, 2021 Berotralstat received the early acces approval for HAE patients in France

\- On February 26, 2021 Berotralstat received positive CHMP opinion for Orladeyo

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating $2,628,170,000 a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of $18,397,190,000 meaning an increase of $104,46 in the stock price.

[Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/zratyvq0r2u61.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=41cd28426b365fec413eadee1236ee71904822e8)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

Rapivab is a bio-defense drug that is often stockpiled by the government. Last time being September the 26th, with a purchase of $14 million.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than $500,000,000 conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/7s0re83fr2u61.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd1c0a8f7dacfc31705d4e0f93577c4dddcaba3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

&#x200B;

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika. 

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.  (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses. 

NIAID on April 9th 2020 its expansion of the Brazilian yellow fever trial to include three cohorts of 8 severely affected COVID-19 patients, each being given a different IV dose regimen . Unfortunately, but obvious in hindsight, this trial was from the beginning underpowered to determine a clinical benefit. The patients were followed for eight weeks after their treatments. 

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage. 

Despite all this and even though the trial was not even powered to detect a clinical difference in the patients, the NIAID, after finding an insignificant difference in outcomes between the small numbers of drug-treated and placebo-treated patients, inexplicably decided to discontinue clinical trials of it for COVID-19, to the great confused dismay of investors and perhaps even taken advantage of by short hedge funds who brought the stock down in late December.

 Bear in mind that during this trial, one of the most lethal strains of COVID-19 we know of was affecting the Brazilian trial sites, later known now as the P.1 or Manaus strain, and could have easily negatively affected the clinical outcomes of this small trial too given that the trial was focused on very sick patients more likely to carry this bad strain.

Interfering with the replication process is a well-established antiviral strategy that has been successfully exploited in developing such life-saving drugs as the nucleoside inhibitors of HIV and acyclovir for herpes simplex complex. This approach could allow a single broad-spectrum drug like galidesivir to address gaps in the U.S. government’s medical countermeasure plan and to possibly replace multiple, pathogen-specific drugs for use in response to both natural outbreaks and bioterrorist threats. 

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than $1B this is 5,67$.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/fxrrrs1qr2u61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=7599688644c70cc0e49c002386039efc181bcca2)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

&#x200B;

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at $75,000,000 = 0.43$

[BCX9250 value: 0.43$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/k683ekasr2u61.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=255260cf9ff156cde132c5ff8344b18528f62441)

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

This is how Bill Sheridan ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""*

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and excited about the incoming future of BCX9930. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the following words.

&#x200B;

*“Embarrassment of riches”*

*“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”*

*“My only concern is i have no concerns”*

*“Pipeline in a molecule”*

*“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”*

*“This is Big”*

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that[ BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to pivotal trials in PNH](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/7d6e0bdb-fc11-4653-a0cb-a8c64e159082) following the successful proof of concept trial.

The company announced that a Pivotal trial for PNH, and proof of concept trials in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021.

A pivotal trial is typically a Phase III clinical trial in the multi-year process of clinical research intended to demonstrate and confirm the safety and efficacy of a treat. A successful pivotal trial is required as evidence for drug marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""100 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 83 percent of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were *transfusion-free*. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

"" Hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3.5 g/dL in treatment-naïve patients and 3.2 g/dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

&#x200B;

To understand properly how positive BCX9930 data was, below you can find a photo were the main undergone studies in this kind of inhibitors is shown, with the results they achieved. What mainly should catch your attention is the Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline - This data has been gathered by Barclays.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it “Pipeline in a molecule”. Those 8 diseases are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to $28,56B - $51B / year. This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 ""  [Due to COVID-19, the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ **7023 million** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.](https://www.marketresearch.com/QYResearch-Group-v3531/Global-PNH-aHUS-Size-Status-13306748/)""

3 - “ Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for 1,65B - 3.3B market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""IgAN. The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds  45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential 7,25B market size using Soliris's yearly price  ""

6 - ""C3G:  Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds  2,31B - 23,1B ""

7 - "" PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning 7.25B""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B. More than 90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""”  C5 inhibitor, being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is.

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.

In 2019 Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,946.4 million. Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick example, using the average biotech mid-cap x7 revenue multiplier, and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019,  3,964B = 27,748B. It would mean a SP value of $157.56 for BCRX. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Phase II study**

Despite the company not PR'ing the start of the phase II study of BCX9930, the official page of[ clinacal trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04702568), show that the start of phase II study was December the 18th, 2020. This is extremely bullish since it reasures our thoughts that Ph I data readout will be good and enough to keep the study going.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a survey with 23 patients, 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris. The survey showed that 91% of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uud6ce7rx2u61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d90f157a39f94bf07330e06c159887435da70d

Some of the patients treated with BCX9930 were asked some questions, among them, the 6th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill. As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill form treatments.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a[ Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293), totally skipping the Ph2.

Additional proof of concept BCX9930[ Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335296) will be made.

Straight jumping from a[ ph1 to a pivotal ph3](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293) trial, is something that's not common in the bio world and could be taken as a really bullish sign. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it accelerates the process of development of the drug, giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time. The quicker the drug is in the market the better, and the more value it brings for investors.

&#x200B;

**4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential *best-in-class treatment*, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30% of Alexion’s buy out price, this is 11.7B meaning 66.44$.

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/c8fck3ytx2u61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2622d005e26eab918e1d33ae84bfe605f34b90a3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is. After recently increasing his stake in BCRX, along with BlackRock, he now owns a 5% of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789% in the last 3 quarters, showing strong conviction in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y598y4yx2u61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c5ce6aa1e60151aea85e69eaa850c8f3362f8e7

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate. A buy out coming from BIIB, company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors, would make total sense in the following 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

&#x200B;

It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates         ( Mergers and Acquisitions ) as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue growth in the incoming years.

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D""""""""  C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%. Being valued at 10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than doable with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX at least expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo, apart from it, additional revenue generated by Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. With this agreement BCRX was funded with $325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch. Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".

Jon Stonehouse CEO, also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved. Showing how bullish they are on BCX9930 and their willingness to invest at it.

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company, obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo approval in Europe / Germany launch.
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the PH2 trials in complement-mediated diseases.
4. BCX9250 Next steps should soon be shared by the company
5. BCX4430 Galidesivir recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID. Next steps for Galidesivir trials may soon be given.
6.  Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around 180$. The StockPrice fair value  number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.","['STT', 'DE', 'BLK', 'BAC', 'JPM', 'MRK', 'ALXN', 'IR', 'BIIB', 'BIO', 'PH']"

mtehdq,,wallstreetbets,post,1618758206,"I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results.**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/v6v86fgm5yt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d99ad37e0f07803910a0ee250883aee7be43ee

 Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7tt84a2o5yt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc245cf01922010a13705e721d564a4299ebbac

Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think!

mu0hvd,,wallstreetbets,post,1618838571,"Supply Chain Disruptions and You: A DiscussionOK, so, I have a thought and I want your opinion on it. I've been trying to figure out why the market has been so choppy lately, even things like Semiconductors where they literally can't physically make enough to meet demand. There's a six month wait to buy a new refrigerator, and I haven't seen my favorite coffee product in over three weeks. 

Then it hit me. My coffee isn't out of stock because of unprecedented demand, it's because the supply chain is *so* disrupted that they can't get the resources they need to make it. I'll bet it's the same thing with Semis and appliances and all that. But how can that be? There was that ship disrupting trade for a few days, but I think a lot of people (myself included) are forgetting that it takes *time* to bring products to market -the more complicated the product or its components the longer it takes.

Covid. We crashed hard when the effects of Covid were first becoming apparent, but since then we've recovered, right? **Wrong.** Those disruptions have been working their way through the supply chain for the last year and they're just now starting to hit for more complex products as manufacturers draw down their reserves and find that their suppliers have been doing the same. Maybe the *raw* materials are available again, but that doesn't matter if it's going to take a few more months to turn those raw materials into components.

*If* that's the case, it could explain why industries like tech have been underperforming of late. There's a mismatch between the perception that we're returning to normality and the reality that we're still feeling the aftershocks of a nearly global shutdown in manufacturing and trade.

*If* that's the case, here's what *I'm* thinking is the play:

* Indices: Continue to moon. Sectors are coming back online and once reality catches up to perception even the laggards like tech will start to contribute again and there's nowhere to go but up. 

* High Industry: 🦘 Gang for a few months. This is where the majority of the disconnect is. They're not working flat out trying desperately to meet demand, the demand is there but they *can't* meet it because they haven't got the material to produce more than a pittance of what's required. How long did disruptions at the bottom of the stack last? That's how long these guys are going to bounce around as people variously pile back in but as many leave because they realize there's still a ways to go before the tippy top of the manufacturing stack is stable again.

* Retail: Tepid to mildly bullish. You can't sell what you can't have, but they've got a lot of pent up demand, and when they start getting things back in stock I reckon the ones that have survived will feed the bulls quite nicely. 

* Raw Materials/Mid Level MFG/ Transportation: Either back to normal or Moon baby. Depends, really. They're likely struggling to meet demand as well, but I feel more bullish on them overall. Their consumers are the ones who just can't get enough of what they want -High Industry. And they *can* be working flat out. This is where I'm personally leaning toward dropping my cash for a while. For them it seems like the disruption has largely passed and I'll be expecting big things over the next few months. The counterpoint, I suppose, would be that it's more or less business as usual for them, so there may not be a true moon shot.

That brings me to the final thing I'd like to discuss. Idiosyncratic vs Systemic risk. I've been talking in broad terms about entire industries or groups of industries, but let's face it, indices are a little boring. They're boring because thanks to diversification they're a bit safer than their constituent parts in isolation. This seems like a personal risk tolerance question -are you happy taking the risk that Bob's Copper Refinery is going to win the big contract (or not) or are you more comfortable riding the broader recovery through some copper specific ETF that I haven't found yet (at least not any that can be discussed here)? That's really a question only you can answer, but I'll let you in on a little secret: the big boys don't do either. They diversify, but just enough that their idiosyncratic risk (the risk that an individual company runs into headwinds specific to them) is mitigated. Even making a bet on two different companies in the same industry can *dramatically* reduce your idiosyncratic risk. You're still at the mercy of *systemic* risk (see the ARKs), but there's no avoiding that.

I'm curious what others think about all this. Am I completely off base? Is there a better way to play the final gasps of last year's shitshow? Tune in next time on, ""Madman Presents: The Slow Descent Into Bankruptcy"" to find out!",

mtkyw2,,wallstreetbets,post,1618778361,"CLOV DD - No BullshitCLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are “non-tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the ""Hindenberg said this” and “S3 said this” bullshit that people have been arguing about...

But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS

Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here’s why:

The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \~30M short volume on 4/8 and \~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.

https://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d

The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it’s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let’s get into the shit that really matters.

First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)

https://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e

* MACD bullish
* RSI only starting to warm up
* Decent support built between $7-$7.30
* But what’s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.

**Now let’s get into call volume**

[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)

https://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed

Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:

* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS
* Hindenberg short report
* Short seller price manipulation

The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.

Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: “Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)”

Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782

It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn’t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.

&#x200B;

**Wrapping this up**

Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC’s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.

&#x200B;

No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don’t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.

$CLOV to $100

EDIT: anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME, it's not. Holding GME, love the setup going into this week.

Also: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah

If your curious why these trends appear common for any ticker, it is because options are priced based on quantitative models (Black-Scholes, Bi-nomial...). The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. 

Curves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. 

With skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack. Meme stocks like GME and AMC have way overpriced OTM calls for example

They are building the “Automated People Mover” at LAX which provides automated tram services. With Bayer they are building their state of the art Cell Culture Technology Center. They build mines, casinos, hotels, reactors. In general they are a world class infrastructure producer which bodes well in the coming infrastructure projects under the present administration.

As the economy slowly picks back up and with infrastructure around the corner, this stock is a strong long term play that should hit a serious catalyst when this admins infrastructure projects begin. 

To quote Zacks: 

“It has a solid track record of receiving awards and management is optimistic about continuation of this trend in the future as well, which is expected to drive growth. The company, being an industry leader in nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the United States, is expected to benefit from the rising demand for energy across the globe.”

Why are you building factories off-grid? and just an FYI, this is a thing, except instead of nuclear, we use LPG/NG or Diesel. Generac can get you all the power you need in a few days without any permits.

mu7dep,,wallstreetbets,post,1618857660,"DD: MVIS go BRRRR and I don't care which way.My medium-term bull case for MVIS.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly.

&#x200B;

I'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said...

&#x200B;

I yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus.

&#x200B;

Positions:

3 GME @ 238

500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg

\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized)

&#x200B;

The most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected.

&#x200B;

In my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now.

&#x200B;

High IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums.

&#x200B;

Lets do some quick and dirty math.

&#x200B;

For our purposes we will use May 21 exp.

&#x200B;

GME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \~193% current price)

MVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \~182% current price)

RKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \~136% current price)

&#x200B;

So, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium / stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

GME: 5.387%

MVIS: 7.273%

RKT: 1.182% (IV is \~60%)

&#x200B;

At 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price.

&#x200B;

If MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too)

&#x200B;

If MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \*bought\* calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them.

&#x200B;

MVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, so let's talk potential gains and losses.

&#x200B;

Because my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!)

&#x200B;

If the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got.

&#x200B;

In summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high. I'm just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty confident in this, so I'm probably fucked. Please teach me. If you want charts and graphs, fuck you do your own DD. If you want rocket emojis, this thread is accepting donations.

mtmvnz,,wallstreetbets,post,1618784292,"$TSP (TuSimple, autonomous truck tech that IPOd this week) is a scam -- DD insideThis isn't investment advice and I'm not making any claims that **TuSimple is a fucking scam**, I'm just a retard.

From TuSimple's [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm):

> Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (“HD”) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, and an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite and components.

In the world of autonomous driving, L4 is the point of full automation and a human isn't needed in the vehicle at all. And technology with a 1,000 meter range doesn't exist (the 35 second ""planning horizon"" is a direct result of the range - it's the amount of time to react at highway speeds).

This article [discusses TuSimple's gear setup](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/article/14197547/autonomous-vehicle-technology-shifts-to-a-more-realistic-gear):

> TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.

Let's go over that again:

 * LiDAR range - 200 meters

 * Microwave radar range - 300 meters

 * **Magical HD cameras that claim to be able to identify vehicles 1,000 meters away - are you fucking kidding me?** I can't link to YouTube, but find the video ""TuSimple's Delivers Enhanced Night Vision Capabilities with New Camera System"" and you'll see that TuSimple's supposed ""improved"" camera is actually less clear, it's just better with headlight glare, and sure as fuck doesn't have a 1,000 meter range

They claim their technology can see [up to 1,000 meters away - triple the range of any competitor](https://www.tusimple.com/technology/), but they outsource all of their hardware and nothing on the market comes close to 1,000 meters. 

> Aeva Inc, a firm founded by former Apple Inc engineers to supply a key self-driving car sensor, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to [supply the sensors for self-driving heavy duty trucks being developed by TuSimple](https://www.reuters.com/article/aeva-tusimple-idUKL1N2K102G)

Oh, and when TuSimple [tried to demonstrate how awesome its autonomous driving system is, it failed](https://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/):

> The demo drive also, however, makes clear there’s work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: “Autonomous driving off.” Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. “I’ve got a freeze on my visual,” he tells Hou. “I shut it down for safety.” A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.

> And so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple’s garage. 

TuSimple hasn't sold any of their technology. [Their revenues are from traditional trucking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1):

> TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.

**TL;DR - $TSP claims to have self-driving technology that has three times the range of anything on the market, but haven't demonstrated it, or sold it, and the equipment they currently use is from other manufacturers. They have 70 trucks (50 in the U.S., 20 in Europe and Asia) on the road making normal freight deliveries, with ""safety drivers"" in the vehicles, and that's where their revenues are generated.**","['HD', 'AAPL']"

mtq4ij,,wallstreetbets,post,1618795473,"DD: Boomer Edition - CSX earnings this weekFor this week's Boomer Dick and Dividends we look once again at 🚂🚂Choo Choo!  No one knows what the fuck is going on with CLOV hard to tell with that ticker if they are selling healthcare or some other clever name for weed stonks anyway.  RIDE bombed out of their Desert race so EVs that aren't Tesla are going to remain fucked because it seems like new millennial mechanics can't figure out how to actually use a DC motor after hyping it for over a decade. (Hint: Plug in motor = ⏩⏩) 

CSX is set for earnings this week and they will almost certainly beat expectations.

Why?  Well there is a handy tool to track rail traffic for CSX available on their own site to track performance metrics which includes the number of rail cars online at any given time.

https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/customers/performance-measures/

If you download the data it shows that the number of cars online hasn't been this high since 2018 (so not just beating out the pandemic numbers but smashing 2019 as well).  Previous years had much higher numbers but CSX did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well.  (You can also see in the data velocity in 2017 was 14.7mph and is now 20mph).  

The short of it is that rail traffic appears to be up about 17% (technically it is 17% more cars online at a given time) while earnings estimates are pegging it at a 7% increase.

(Example of earning estimate stating this just recently https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-report-q1-earnings-low-155803201.html)

On top of that the the rail cost index was near an all time high in Q1 (https://www.aar.org/rail-cost-indexes/) which means that prices on rail freight were UP UP UP.  So they are moving more 🚂and charging 💵💰.  If you looks at earnings estimates regardless of the firm everyone seems to be pegging them at a slight increase from 2020 when the 17% increase was a sharp and almost immediate change on the year.  

If you need further confirmation from a non-CSX source the AAR also confirms that traffic is back to prepandemic levels of you remove the february blip from the Texas freeze.  CSX doesn't operate any lines in Texas so it is reasonable to assume that they weren't majorly impacted as their own data displays. https://www.aar.org/data-center/rail-traffic-data/

To top it off there is not a single part of the transportation industry that isn't struggling to meet demand right now.  CSX isn't going to be a magical exception and just have small growth when they have major lines throughout the major manufacturing centers of the Eastern US.  You can bet that they are doing it with less employees due to across the board labor shortages (listed as a concern in their annual report) and with an increasingly energy efficient line of 🚂 since they have been investing in and showing upgrades for years.

Pros: 

CSX is a profit heavy industry with government support that consistently out paces SPY as a long term investment even if you ignore the 1% per year dividend.

CSX is going to beat earnings because earnings were assuming moderate recovery vs the explosive recovery we got.  Almost no reason to doubt this and no reason to doubt they continue to do well throughout the year because as you can see in sky rocketing commodities pricing we simply cannot meat the demand for materials right now.  🚂 Are much 💪 vs tiny 🚛 when it comes to moving things like wood, steel and copper across the nation to be processed.

CSX didn't get hit by the Texas shutdown as they are an east coast outlet.  This means they will look better than several competitors with lines closer to or inside of Texas

CSX like all the major railroads prints money with a 27%ish profit margin year to year.  Railroads are a lifeblood to American supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years.  Government support and regulations keep the industry wide stability and growth in place with more and more companies realizing that rail is the ideal way to move bulk goods when you have smart systems to plan around the delivery dates.  As long as Tony Musk and Tim 🍏 don't start shooting our goods down 🧲 tubes soon railroads are going to be good for a while.  

Cons: Good earnings reports don't always mean good stock prices 😕🙃.  Lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped.  (Stonks did not like the last report but it also wasn't really that good).  $CSX did show very strong and steady growth after the last report so the real question is if there is a drop off on the report or not.  I lean towards no dip but it would suck to buy now and miss the dip since the last one was $10 drop 😕🚂💥.  

Time based Efficiency metrics are down a bit for Q1.  Trains are slightly slower and dwell times at stations are slightly longer.  Mostly labor based but it's still an issue for the slowest form of transit to move slower (note that vs 4 years ago they are 30%+ better).

Boomer Points:. 
🚂 Are an amazing and under appreciated form of transportation.  They are incredibly 👕 so the Democrats currently in power love them and they are big tough machines so Republicans tend to love them too!  It's vastly agreed upon that is long as you are a properly 💉 citizen that you will almost certainly love 🚂 and the way they follow simple patterns too!  💉💉💉💉⬆️🆙⏫=🚂🚂🚂🚂⏫🆙⬆️

Dividends: Essentially comes out to about 1% of the stock price per year if you hold it that long.  More or less free growth on something already beating SPY YOY.

Positions: I don't have any 😕.  Just saw this coming weeks earning notice has CSX.  Looked and saw it didn't appear to have a pre-earnings spike and decided that the rail data should probably show increased traffic since my companies rail cars keep getting stuck in station traffic.  The data shows a 17% increase in traffic and now I wish I had $CSX but I can't buy it til tomorrow.

Recommendations: Worst case scenario is probably that earnings randomly tank it for no good reason.  Last time it took a month to recover on bad earnings so if you aren't going to do shares then buy a call that ends a month from now.  No puts.  🚂💥🌈🐻","['CSX', 'TSLA']"

# Introduction

Hey, it's your girl Dry-Drink. Was a WSBs lurker for years, used to be that this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? But now it seems we pride ourselves on being retards who lose money for a living with options we don't understand. What happened to us? Here's to bringing back some old-school circa 2017 WSBs.

I've [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kspobo/true_wsb_leveraged_portfolio_continues_to_deliver/) about this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/) and strategy. I've gotten a lot of questions as to how it works and how to implement it so I've put together my definitive guide on this. From here on out, I'll just post updates of the portfolio performance periodically. I don't have a TLDR, unfortunately if you're interested in implementing this, you will have to read through this short guide. It's not super complicated once you get it, I promise.

# Glossary

Compensated vs Uncompensated Risk: The market rewards you for some risks, specifically the ones that cannot be diversified away (like overall market risk, or the risk of value companies). The market does not reward you with a return for taking on risks that can be diversified away. In other words, no one is paying you money for betting the farm on one stock.

[Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) Criterion: The percent of your account to invest in a risky asset to have maximum compound returns. For stocks, the Kelly Criterion is given by the formula [Sharpe/Volatility](https://www.cashchronicles.com/2019/05/20/the-kelly-investment-criteria-and-optimal-leverage/). So for stocks, maximum compound return (Kelly bet) is around 0.4/20% = **200%** (that is, you borrow as much money as you have, to buy twice as much in stocks as you otherwise could, by using leverage).

Margin Call: When your account equity is too low versus the stocks you hold, your broker can force you to sell stocks with a margin call. In other words, if your leverage is too high, the broker will de-leverage you automatically.

Portfolio Margin (PM): A margin account that determines margin maintenance with risk models instead of set leverage targets. It will typically allow greater leverage (**not that you should use more leverage than I say later)** and, most importantly, will let you [sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) for cheap borrowing with no effect on the margin maintenance.

Smart-beta: Catch-all term for equity indices or ETFs that are not market-cap weighted, but actually tilt towards additional sources of stock compensated risks (value, momentum and quality being the big three). Because these added risk sources are uncorrelated with the market, they lead to portfolios with higher returns and lower risk

# Background

For maximum compound growth, you want two things: Only take risk that compensate you, and take as much as it is optimal for max returns (Kelly bet size). In this post, I am going to show you the portfolio that has the theoretically highest compound return. History confirms this portfolio works, but don't invest in this because it worked well in the past or my updates. That the theory is well-supported in historical returns and practice is just the cherry on top.

Big-picture, the portfolio can be set up as follows:

1. Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms). You want country, currency and sector diversification to make sure you diversify away as much of the risk you don't get paid for and only take on compensated, equity risk. Using smart-beta further increases returns.
2. Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage). That is, borrow on margin to borrow twice as many shares as you otherwise could.
3. \- Bonus) [Sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\~0.5% borrowing rate, instead of Interactive Brokers 1.6% margin rate). This is not required, the most important part is the actual portfolio and level of leverage (steps 1 and 2). This is just a cheaper way to borrow.

**Note:** This is NOT riskless. On the contrary, this is a high-risk strategy, with plenty of financial risk. You can lose money and A LOT of money in the short/medium and, heck, even long-term. It would've lost about 83% during 2008 GFC, even more during the Great Depression. But eventually, it has and should come out ahead. All I'm saying is that it is the highest amount of risk that you would rationally take with a portfolio and hence, will have the highest average, expected, compound return. Taking any less risk (less leverage) should result in lower compound returns, that's logical. And taking any more risk (more leverage) also leads to lower compound returns (that's what the Kelly Criterion proves).

# Benefits

1. No position on volatility or downside protection (aka ""theta gang immune"").
2. Only takes on compensated risk. Better global diversification and access to smart-beta products than you otherwise could with options and futures.
3. Extremely tax efficient. It borrows as cheaply as you could with options and futures, but gains all stay unrealized.
4. Much more protected from short-term movements (you don't lose 30% just because your favorite stock missed earnings).

# Audience

The portfolio has the highest expected compound growth from index investing and requires little active management (no individual stocks or trying to time a trend). **Hence, it is ideal as a base WSB portfolio.** If you believe you can consistently trade for a living, that's great! You should probably ignore this post. But if you've lost enough money to feel like the market is a casino, here's a portfolio where you can let your money simmer and earn high returns before you decide on your next YOLO. I personally only use this; every time I have more money to invest, I just direct it into this portfolio.

# My Portfolio

I opened a Portfolio margin account at Interactive Brokers. You need >$100K for this (see below for smaller-account alternatives) I use a 60% USA, 25% Developed Market, 15% Emerging market split, all with low-cost, smart-beta stock ETFs. I've posted my portfolio on each of my updates but here it is once more. Again, just a bunch of stock ETFs that use smart-beta methodology, have low costs, and diversify globally. Feel free to use the same ones. I especially like Vanguard Multifactor fund (VFMF), the Schwab Fundamental funds (like FNDC) and the iShares multifactor funds (like EMGF). If you want something simple, a portfolio like:

30% VFMF

30% VTI

15% FNDF

10% ISCF

7% FNDE

8% EMGF

Is very close to what I use. Or feel free to copy my exact weights below. You'll see different positions because I tax-loss harvested back in March 2020.

[Current Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/rb14mo0640u61.png?width=2952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a242fe349528291cc664942edcacba378ef011f8)

So far, I am up \~108% annualized since June 2020 but, again, do NOT do this just because it worked well in the past. Do it because you understand and agree with the theory. I plan to do this for decades. I recommend you use Interactive Brokers due to their low margin rates. Although if you'll sell SPX boxes to avoid the margin rates, you could do it anywhere that offers portfolio margin (ex: TDA).

# Managing the Portfolio

You opened a Portfolio Margin account, bought twice as much in stocks as you had money for (using your ideal ETFs in the weights shown above, or the ones I use) and even sold SPX boxes to get rid of your negative cash balance to borrow cheaply. What to do now?

As the market rises, your equity will grow and your leverage (as a percent of the account) will drop. So it is vital you re-leverage further (borrow more against your bigger account) and buy more stocks to get back up to 2:1 leverage. If markets drop in value, you'll do the opposite: control your risk by selling some positions, paying off some of the debt, and bringing leverage back down. This is KEY towards avoiding actual deep, nearly-100% losses and to obtain the highest compound return. Just like boomers rebalance their 50/50 stock/bond Vanguard portfolios back to 50/50 if it gets out of line, so should you keep your portfolio at roughly 2:1 leverage. And no, it's not ""buying high, selling low"". You can't time the markets, so just stay disciplined and rebalance. This portfolio has the highest compound return **despite** having to sell somewhat during down markets. To minimize transaction costs and the cost of weekly whipsaws, I recommend you sell and decrease leverage if your leverage is higher than 2.2x, and buy more stocks by borrowing/re-leveraging back up if your leverage is lower than 1.8x. These are the **rebalancing bands**.

When you sell positions to deleverage, you would want to either keep the additional cash as collateral until the next SPX box expires, or just buy back a box. I recommend selling boxes in the near future (3-12 months) so you're always decently close to an expiring box, or a box so close to expiry that buying it back would entail very low spreads. BTW, when a box expires, you don't have to do anything. It is cash-settled automatically.

If you ever add money into this account, just invest it in such a way to get close to that 2:1 leverage. So if leverage was less than 2:1, you'd buy stocks with your added cash+more borrowing, if leverage was higher maybe you just keep it in cash/ST bond fund like ICSH/buy back a box spread. Play it by ear in your specific circumstance, just make sure your leverage stays within the rebalancing bands.

# Timing the Market

It is reasonable to let leverage rise a bit past 2.2x if markets are quite cheap because they've dropped in value (like in March 2020). It also is reasonable to let leverage drift down if markets are at ATHs (see my current portfolio is only about 1.75:1 leverage right now). The Kelly Criterion is clear that you'd want to leverage past 2:1 if the equity risk premium is abnormally high and vice-versa, so it makes sense. Don't do A LOT of that but a little bit of opportunistic market-timing (I call it ""delayed rebalancing"" when stocks are either real cheap or real expensive) is likely warranted.

# Looking Forward

No, you're not late to the party. Obviously, it would've been better to start a portfolio like this back in June 2020 when I first posted about it but hindsight is 20/20. This strategy does not require timing the markets; today is still a good time to start. Even today, stocks are decently priced, especially if using smart-beta. I expect this leveraged portfolio to have a return going forward of about 13% average annualized. Obviously, what you'll actually get short-term might be much more or much less but if you diligently stick to it, that would be the average return I expect. This is about three times as high as I expect for the very-expensive S&P500 (because of the 2:1 leverage, the international exposure and the smart beta vs the S&P 500 at a nosebleed valuation level of 37 Shiller CAPE 10).

# FAQs

\- Account minimum to start?

Ideally, you start with $100K (somewhat more is preferable to give you a cushion over the $100K barrier) and a portfolio margin account. Otherwise, you can just use regular margin and pay the slightly higher borrowing cost. I probably wouldn't bother if I had less than $20K, but if you have $50K or more, I'd say go for it.

\- What if I get margin called?

If you follow the strategy as you should (selling positions if losses mount, to pay back the debt and keep the leverage around 2:1) then you should never actually get to a position where your leverage is so high, your broker is liquidating you themselves. So you should never get an actual margin call.

\- What about using Leveraged ETFs (ex: SPUU)?

Those have high management fees, sometimes have too much leverage (ex: UPRO), will not let you diversify globally as effectively, there are no smart-beta options and they rebalance daily (instead of using the 1.8-2.2 leverage bands I recommend). IMO, it's better to rebalance a little less frequently than daily (this is what using bands accomplishes).

\- Where can I learn more about this? How did YOU learn it?

Unfortunately, I don't actually have a good resource for you. I've learned a lot about smart-beta, leverage, the Kelly Criterion and these topics to know what I'm doing here but it has been from a bunch of different sources. I hope this is enough to get you started though.

\- Why not more leverage for more returns?

Don't leverage more than this. Leveraging further leads to **overbetting (a condition where you're past the Kelly Criterion).** Any more leverage than that, and your portfolio risk goes up and your return goes down. Don't be a Bill Hwang and blow up with margin calls. Be disciplined, rebalance, keep leverage around 2:1, and let the portfolio do its magic.

\- Doesn't this only work during Bull markets?

This is the opposite of the above FAQ since it implies I'm using too much leverage. This is the theoretically highest compound returning portfolio **given** the risk of stocks (i.e. including both bear and bull markets). Obviously, in bull markets, it will perform amazingly (like now). And portfolios with even more leverage will be even better. During Bear markets, it will perform worse than not using leverage (and portfolios with more leverage will do far worse). Since I can't time the market or know when good or bad periods will come, I just use the optimal leverage a long-term portfolio would need for max returns. That's 2:1.

\- This sounds like the famous Hedgefundie UPRO/TMF portfolio no?

I personally think that portfolio has multiple problems (the LETFs themselves, the risk parity weights do not lead to max sharpe, even if it were max sharpe, I'm aiming for max compound growth not max Sharpe, and the leverage of 3x is just about past the Kelly Criterion). [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/gtwe5p4/?context=3) a chain of comments where I dig into the math I used to come to these personal conclusions.

\- Doesn't this lose money during Bear markets? If you use 2:1 leverage, shouldn't it have been wiped out during the GFC (stocks dropped more than 50% then)?

It loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for).

\- Can I do better if I add non-stock assets, or use dma200, or etc?

Probably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly. Ditto for any other strategy like dma200; if I felt confident about them, I would add them so if you do, then add them, that's totally fine!

\- Why do you only show returns since June?

Been doing this for a few years but only have computed data from Interactive Brokers since June. Before that, I used other brokers and it would be a pain to try to compute my personal overall returns. If you don't believe I got through Dec 2018 or March 2020, then I can't really do much for you. [Here's a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=5&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=2%3A1+Leveraged+S%26P+500&portfolioName2=S%26P+500&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=200&allocation1_2=100&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100) since 1985 showing it wouldn't have blown up, even during 2008, (though the drawdowns can be deep, again, there's risk!) and does outperform eventually as theory would say. 

\- Well, I invested in X stock and got much higher returns!

Good for you (srs)! If I knew what stocks to pick to make a lot of money, I would just do that. But I have no clue, so I'm just investing in a few sources of high risk/returns, diversify away all risk I don't get paid for and leverage to the maximum compound return.

\- This doesn't belong in WSBs, why are you posting it?

I thought a 2:1 smart-beta leveraged stock portfolio, funded with SPX boxes, would be the kind of portfolio WSBs would appreciate. If it's boring, I get it, I'll just post gain/loss porn from here on out any ways.

mth8b4,,wallstreetbets,post,1618766856,"PSFE DDPaysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.

 The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. 

Paysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. 

Taking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. 

Other notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. 

Advantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. 

&#x200B;

Finances.

PSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. 

The market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.

PLTR-68

COST-6.3

AAPL-19.1

MCD- 17.1

INTC-6.03

SPOT-27

SQ-42.6

PYPL-31.6

VISA-28.8

Relatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. 

Taking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. 

&#x200B;

Overall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. 

I started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.

Edit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence. Also fixed market cap # because google is a liar

**Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary:**

A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don’t know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don’t know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don’t think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why. 

**Binariness:**

First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(*i.e given a prediction date t1, did the the prediction come true by t2➝t1+3months?*). Being fair, they will take this statistical flaw into account and take and compare different t2 values( *t2➝t1+3weeks,  t2➝t1+6months,  t2➝t1+next quarter, etc)* but I want to exclaim that the issue is that the predictions are NOT analyzed independently, when they should/need to be. 

**Why were they wrong?:**

So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let’s assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision. 

**Direct contradiction of the prediction:**

Let’s say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a    

prediction that says “Stock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good 

earnings. ” and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ½ legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met). 

**Missing leg of thesis:**

Elaborating on the above example’s outcome where ½ legs were met, it is important to   
 ask why this leg was missing? Did the predictor take this leg into account and disregard   
 it? Did they just not think of it? Either way, it is important for any predictor to think of all 

variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of 

these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong. 

**Black Swan Event:**

But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the 

available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective 

at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I’m not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive. 

**Thesis has not been satisfied:**

Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says “Stock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2” but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric. 

**Devils advocate: Why were they right?**

I don’t think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but 

obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit. 

**Bayesian Statistics:**

This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability: 

P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to **(**the probability of event B GIVEN that event A is true**)\*(**the probability of event A happening**)** all divided by **(**the probability of event B happening**).** Now, I won’t continue with the maths but I want to get across that this is the framework that should be used when quantifying a correctness metric. A metric that scores an outcome with respect to its thesis happening. After basing each right or wrong on its underlying factor, you will receive a bayesian approached ratio of totalCorrect/totalPredictions. 

**Conclusion:**

Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I’m not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn’t see where the time went. Fuck

**TL:DR**

Don’t trust all articles that say “\[Your fav analyst\] is only right 50% of the time!”. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness.","['LEG', 'TSLA']"

Root Insurance - $ROOTBeen trying to find value stocks but it’s not easy in a bull market so I’d thought I’d look at heavily shorted stocks. Haven’t seen much discussion about this company and thought I’d share. 

Root Insurance is a fintech company that had an IPO at the end of October. Their aim is to reinvent how auto insurance is done. You download the app and let it monitor your driving behavior for a few weeks. After the trial test driving period is done they give you a quote. Services are in 30 states. They are also getting into the home insurance market.

They seem to have a ton of class action lawsuits against them, the typical “contact us if you lost money on your investment” that every company has to deal with. They debuted at $27 and have gone down since and are at $10.30 as of writing this.  

Looking at insider transactions I noticed someone named Meyer Malka bought one million shares at $27 near IPO. Later in December he bought the dip and increased his position by 753,976 shares at $16.55 each. 

Did a web search for him and found this Walmart press release. 

https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/11/walmart-announces-creation-of-new-fintech-startup

ROOT is currently 41% sold short. I want to compare it to LMND which is also an insurance company that had IPO recently but I haven’t been following that company at all so I won’t say anymore on the subject.

This is actually a profitable company unlike Palantir. To compare, Palantir is a 40B Mcap. 

It's expected to smash it's very low estimates. It has the last 3 times.

Analysists have given the stock high estimates. 

https://preview.redd.it/9djhjmpw66u61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72c78d1f8d2185e7c0222e305e41b3377d94d73

The stock is down like some lesser known SaaS stocks. However, it's lagging behind recovery. 

To compares analysis estimates: Palantir +14.36%,

The stock saw an insane increase of activity from insider trading, hedge funds, and general volume in the last quarter. 

While we don't like hedge funds, it's odd to see this volume of buy without much selling - especially as it's dipping. 

  
Q: **Why is this a post lockdown player?**

A: The tool was sold to lodes of companies trying to better themselves. Carnival cruise bought it when there weren't any cruises. Ceazers bought it when no one was gambling. Chevron USA when oil hit all time low. These companies are now imbedded to the service. 

Q: **Why don't companies do these things in house?**

A: The training, and learning, is free. In-house teams can learn this and join the community for free. In-house teams want this instead of trying to build there own.

Q: Why is May special?

A:  Annual conference, Inspire, will take place May 18-21 “**This year, we will announce major innovations across analytics automation, data science, machine learning and AI and the Alteryx Community platform**.”

mu4p61,,wallstreetbets,post,1618850463,"CGNT likely to be acquired by NNDM **TL;DR**: Cognyte (CGNT) will very likely be acquired by Nano-Dimensions (NNDM), in a form of merger called a Reverse Triangular Merger, for a number of reasons including: highly synergistic offerings, favorable tax treatment and government funding given enjoyed by both Israeli companies, posturing and hiring of new executives in the defense space with head of M&A being recent president at Verint systems division which was spun-off to become CGNT as of February 2021. The combined entity would be profitable due to CGNT’s expanding margins and revenues along with NNDM’s large cash position and cash burn that is manageable on the combined balance sheet. Additionally the combined entity would be an industry leader with more offerings and capabilities globally than their competitors of Palantir or Fire Eye. The acquisition will occur quickly and likely be funded significantly from NNDM stock and the rest cash. Given the mismatch of market caps and estimated BV multiple of 7x-10x CGNT shareholders will be winners in the merger transaction, achieving a very favorable stock-to-stock exchange rate + cash consideration. Conservative estimated total value per share realized from CGNT shareholders of 40% relative to current share price with 16% low end premium if deal terms inked in the past few months are realized mark to market.

**Why CGNT as Acquisition Target**

· NNDM has been highly vocal that they are planning an Acquisition for some time

· From the 20-F SEC filings from both companies they state that there are tax and royalties penalties from merging/acquiring a non-Israeli company along with manufacturing products outside of Israel, which CGNT does have manufacturing plant in Israel. Acquisition target would likely need to be an Israeli Company

· Both companies receive funding from the IIA which is a material part of project funding, with ramifications from merging/acquiring non-Israeli company.

· CGNT is the cyber threat and security spin off of Verint with the spin off occurring Feb 1, 2021. They are profitable with their growth strategy being expanding enterprise customer base, growing deeper with existing customers, adding verticals. This fits well with NNDM as they can aid expansion of verticals for both enterprise and government via production of and protection of enterprise/5G/security operations devices (CGNT provides IP data theft identification and prevention which is critical for NNDM to serve large enterprise customers)

· From the AME Academy NNDM demos different device capabilities of their systems including 5g, implantable/tattooable sensors which would be synergistic for CGNT security operations

· CGNT business model of software as a service meshes perfectly with NNDM’s plan to transition business model to software side from purely a manufacturer

· CGNT is profitable, the spin-off only makes sense if it was done for the purpose of a sale, 4 of 7 CGNT board members are current Verint board members/executives

· Hanan Gino appointed Chief Product Officer and Head of Strategic M&A: He was most recently in charge of the division of Verint that becam

**Why a Reverse Triangular Merger**

· The licensing agreement between Verint and CGNT only allow critical IP to be used if they are using for existing business activities and are not acquired by a 3rd party. The agreement does allow to be used by affiliates via sublicensing.

· A reverse triangular merger allows the acquisition to take place while keeping critical licensing contracts intact for CGNT

· The target (CGNT) must own substantially all of its assets and perform substantially the same business activities in order to qualify.

· The benefit of this type of transaction allows the acquisition to take place tax free if certain conditions are met, 80% of consideration is stock of acquirer and not more than 20% cash (might act differently due to different Israeli regulations)

· This kind of transaction can be performed quickly with minimal regulatory and shareholder actionse CGNT

· CGNT wording within their 20-F filling allows them to pass a merger/acquisition with 25% shareholder approval, classified as Emerging Growth Company and aren’t required to disclose proxy statements. They will easily be able to pass the merger without going through public shareholder announcement.

**What will NNDM need to Pay**

· Current CGNT market cap of $1.6ish billion

· Recent filing from CGNT lists Book Value of the company as $301.5M

· Using some conservative multiples of 7x-10x book value using competitors like FireEye, Palantir and IBM we get a Price of $2.7B to acquire CGNT (8.7x Book Value, $40 per share)

· Value at Current NNDM Share Price: At 80% of the consideration being stock to be tax free the exchange rate of CGNT to NNDM shares would need to be around 4 shares of NNDM for every 1 share of CGNT in addition to $8 per share in cash. This isn’t possible currently given that would exceed NNDM current shares outstanding so the cash consideration would need to be more or the agreed value of NNDM shares be higher (trading between 12-16 when CGNT was spun-off)

&#x200B;

Highlighted prices are around CGNT spin off

· If the agreed value is at the recent direct offering at 12.8 per share of NNDM then the consideration paid would be 2.5 shares of NNDM for every share of CGNT and an $8 per share cash consideration. (This exact case likely would not occur unless SP rises or considerably more cash is paid above the tax consequence of breaching 20% cash – Virent still controls board and needs to ensure significant value is provided to former shareholders and justify spin-off)

· NNDM has the ability and spare cash to repurchase shares in order to drive price up in order to get NNDM market price up the pre-determined exchange rate value

· SEC Filing on Feb 15. 2021 amends the company’s articles to allow the board to call upon shares from shareholders giving further latitude for forcing acquisition if need be

**Other Notes and Consideration**

Options Activity

· Both CGNT and NNDM have extremely high options activity for May expirations

· NNDM Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.53 indicates strong bearish sentiment

· CGNT Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.06 and Put/Call volume of 0.01 indicates extremes in bearish sentiment but the extremeness of the value implies the opposite, being a major turning point

CGNT is required to pay Verint a one time cash dividend of $35m, being an impact per share of $0.51, theoretically this should already be priced in but the merger announcement would likely be after this payment is complete.

CGNT has affiliations with a blank cheque company according to the SEC website indicating that the merger has already been planned as a blank cheque company is required for a Reverse Triangular Merger.

**Risk Factors**

· NNDM stock is driven further down or doesn’t recover and the deal goes through anyway at unfavorable terms

· The combination of the two entities are viewed negatively and value is lost

· I completely misinterpreted the SEC fillings and Israeli tax laws

· The deal does not go through and the standalone CGNT entity is worth far less than expected

· CGNT was left with unknown liabilities passed off from Verint

· CGNT financials are misstated and fraudulent

**Conclusion**

While I think that NNDM will acquire CGNT if I am wrong about that I still believe that CGNT is an acquisition target for another company based on my findings.

If a merger doesn’t happen CGNT is still a strong play in their sector and has strong growth and profitability in the same industry as Palantir which saw ridiculous amounts of interest. I think the risks associated with this play are managed well, my view of probability of high returns in a short amount of time make for excellent risk adjusted return potential.

It appears we are in a commodity supercycle replicating 2008 and 2010 cycles on this particular stock. 
Steel prices have been hitting record highs what seems to be almost every other week. Iron ore prices are also at record time highs, as well as other building materials. 

With these rapid price Increases it's extremely possible that we are currently in a supercycle. They show no immediate signs of slowing down.
I encourage you to look at June 13 2008 when the share price reached $101.58 a share. And then again in april 29 2011 when the share price reached $93.72 a share. It appears this time around supply cannot meet demand just like on these past 2 dates that were in commodities supercycles.

mt3oba,,wallstreetbets,post,1618710101,"CLOV degenerates be carefulSigh... be careful CLOV degenerates. This high short interest stuff has already been debunked it looks like. The high short interest shown was a mistake by Factset and the short% of float is way way lower. Short interest is actually only about 35% of float, which is moderately high but not anywhere remotely close to the 145% being spread around.

1. Institutional shares like Vanguard that are counted in the post are freely tradable and are never deducted from a float calculation.
2. Clover’s publicly traded equity are Class A shares. Clover’s CEO only holds Class B shares. The screenshot shows that FactSet accidentally thought CEO Garipalli’s 83 million Class B shares were Class A shares. They were not, but because of the mistake FactSet subtracted them from the calculation of Class A float, which led to the mistakenly low number.

In other words, the screenshot of the “evidence” actually debunks this thesis.

There are about 109.8 million shares in the free float, and FactSet, Bloomberg, and Reuters are now all in agreement on that. But when FactSet subtracted 83 million from that by mistake it made it look like the float was only \~27 million (109.8 - 83) which made it look like the short interest as a % of float was massive.

FactSet corrected their numbers today. S3 Partners (which was cited in media and relied on FactSet) will likely correct next, then the handful of media articles that cited S3 (and indirectly FactSet) will probably correct as well.

There are actually a ton of shares available to short (30 million) according to IHS Markit, another short data provider. The cost to borrow is cheap at about 1.5-2%. None of this is consistent with a squeeze scenario.

Want to find high short interest names like everyone else but this is just not the one.

EDIT: S3 has now corrected their short interest based on the incorrect input from Factset, their SI% of float number has changed to 36.97% [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236)

So what this shows is the CFO sold 255K shares but she has over 1.7 million shares in total coming to her, most of which are unvested. So instead of a 100% sale, this is actually more like 15-20%. Which is a totally reasonable divestment when you're talking about this kind of money.",

Every post, I tell WSBs that this strategy still has excellent potential (smart-beta and stocks are still looking quite attractive). Every post, a smooth-brained idiot tells me smart-beta is dead, that this only makes money in bull markets (the last 220 years are not enough evidence apparently..), etc. And every time, I ignore them, follow the strategy (buying stocks if needed) and it continues to deliver.

Also, saw so much loss porn yesterday. Was a WSB lurker for years, used to be this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? Now it's only about retards who lose money for a living with options they don't understand, and holding a stock just because they bought it higher and everyone else does too. It's not ""diamond hands"" dumbass, that's called ""sunk cost fallacy"".

If you've lost enough money to realize trading is like a casino, and want to make money again, WSB old-school style, well, this strategy STILL has plenty of potential to go.",['AMD']

So, first, I think I understand that as the market goes up, your leverage decreases and so you then use that leverage to buy more, that's the compounding part, right? But if it goes down, and you need to sell to maintain your leverage ratio, I guess it may not necessarily be at a loss due to overall cost basis, but it certainly could be, no? And if you're buying more on the way up, that just turns it into a wash sale, unless you wait 90 days which seems like way too long to rebalance. But you're not selling on the way up, so where are the profits coming from? Solely unrealized gains? So what am I missing/not understanding here?

Also you've mentioned this *could* be done with a smaller portfolio, but afaik, portfolio margin needs 100k minimum. I read in another comment you mentioned selling puts when the account was closer to 50k, but that doesn't generate buying power like selling a box spread with PM does, so I'm confused here as well, and almost all of those tickers have very very poor option chains with no liquidity to sell puts on anyway.",['PM']

[US Weekly Box Office Grosses \($\) - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/tu8r6jo3rst61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0fced0cbc3ace032915b3d860fe811bead118f)

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film’s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, “[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)” already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan’s puzzling sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” is projected to take the weekend’s top spot, while Roadside Attraction’s “The Courier” are other notable new films releasing this weekend. (Source: Bloomberg 4/17/21)

***5) Wall Street ""Hate-Love"" Relationship***

Wall Street analysts absolutely HATED the stock in 2020. From May 2020 to March 2021 there wasn't a single BUY rating. B. Riley analyst Eric Wold was the FIRST to put a BUY rating on AMC since the pandemic. On Friday he said that the CEO’s comments on the share authorization should be interpreted as good news on AMC’s cash position for the year.

On Wednesday, Aron told YouTube host Trey Collins in an interview on “Trey’s Trades”: “We hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.”

Aron also said AMC still has authorization to issue 43 million shares “that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.” Excerpts of the interview were [disclosed in a securities filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921050489/tm2113075d1_defa14a.htm)dated Thursday.

Over the past year Wall Street analysts still keeps a fairly high rating on the stock,

&#x200B;

***5) AMC Lightens Up Debt Like GME***

Like all companies, going into the pandemic highly levered (with tons of debt) wasn't a good idea, which is not surprising that so many hedge funds went after GME and AMC. GME recently announced that they are going to be debt free and AMC also lightened up their load this year when various PE firms like Silver Lake and Mudrick coverted their convertible notes into equity.

[AMC's debt in coming years is low and at a very low interest rate \(sub 3&#37;\), with the majority of its callable debt maturing in 2026. The company is now generating cash flow again which will easily have plenty of runway to get them through 2021 and to 2026. They should have no liquidity issues this year so as long as theatres continue to re-open. \(Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgwc4f9ut61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b8df16a0de21a46980107df20eeb7e1e4df7387)

***6) SHORT INTEREST BACK UP***

Almost at 100% utilization, and 93.92MM shares short interest, next week will be interesting. Borrowing rates have also jumped back up this week. For those who are hoping for a gamma squeeze or short squeeze, I'm sure there are tons of you already reading other DDs and watching YouTube videos so I don't need to explain here. We're all here to make money. I'll be honest, I did a YOLO bet using AMC Call Options on the first pump up to $20 in late Jan and paperhanded and took gainz on the ride up. Now that the stock has pulled back to a decent level, this time I'm using shares, as there is just way too much market manipulation going on in the weekly options expirations with the market makers. This week, I saw tons of tutes coming in buying big blocks (100,000 to 1,000,000 share blocks) of AMC throughout the week, and I started accumulating from the high $8 range. Will continue to watch the MaxPain and options activity in coming days and weeks and play the trading range in addition to HOLDing shares.

For those following today's race in Baja in which Lordstown Motors entered a souped up version of their EV truck ""Endurance,"" hopefully you're already trying to figure out what to do with your positions Monday at open. For those who didn't follow the race,  despite what Lordstown released on Facebook and Twitter, it really can't be viewed as anything other than a disaster. 

The truck's battery gave out at mile 40, at which point the driver (who is apparently a janitor or security guard at LM) veered a mile off course so they could recharge. The truck sat not moving for around two hours before taking the wrong route to get back on course and finally deciding to just turn around and drive back to the start via the highway. 

Honestly, that's not the worst part.  Lordstown posted a video to Instagram showing the truck in action during the race.  It was *ahem* ...underwhelming. My 68 year old mother would have passed them on the shoulder in her 10 year old Chevy Malibu and flipped them the bird for driving like a bitch. One of the biggest concerns many have had about this truck is that having the motors in the wheel hubs versus mounted to the body would cause serious issues on bumpy terrain and lead to the motors being rendered inoperable when you hit a pothole. The video of them driving Miss Daisy though the Baja desert did not assuage these fears for me.  Perhaps it did for others. Perhaps I'm overreacting. 

I had hoped to see them go balls to the wall.  Announce their presence with aplomb and say ""Here we are, America! Come get yours off the line in September!"" At least then if it broke down (like literally 50% of the entrants in this race), you could at least say ""Hey, we went for it.  We've got some things to work on before next year's race, but the truck is still a winner."" Instead, they drove it like a 90 year old who is driving for the first time in their life five minutes after smoking their first fatty. And they still broke down 40 miles into the 250 mile race. Really disappointing. 

So, positions. 

200 shares @ 11.95 average that I expect to lose value as I will continue to hold long term. 

15 4/23C $13
25 4/23C $12
25 4/23C $10
10 4/23P $8 

The options were stupid and overly optimistic, but I bought them as lottery tickets hoping that Lordstown would push the truck to the limits today.  They didn't. 

My only source of hope right now is that this market makes no sense.  Maybe they'll shake this off and spike Monday. Should have joined the theta gang and sold some covered calls of my shares.

Edit: more embarrassment.  The other EV in the race,  lovingly nicknamed ""the shitbox,"" which is nothing more than an old 4runner mated with a damn Nissan Leaf is still going strong and on pace to finish under the time limit.","['FB', 'TWTR']"

CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,” they said, concluding, “stick with this top performing ARK ETF.”

Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.

It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

&#x200B;

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

&#x200B;

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

&#x200B;

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

Let's look at her track record : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on ""INNOVATION"" is obviously her success or stock market secret.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html)

What’s the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

""For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains"".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

“It is impossible to produce SUPERIOR performance unless you do SOMETHING DIFFERENT from the majority.”

Sir John Templeton : In 1954, he entered the mutual fund market and created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth over 15% per year for 38 years.

In a couple years most of the OEMs will be featuring siriusxm similar to terrestrial radio.  I will not be surprised if the dealers will be offering siriusxm radio for 3 to 5 years as a standard part of the transaction.  

Let it make it clear.  I am not advocating sirius xm as a service but rather as a Business whose $1.668 B fcf in 2020 is 8 more than spotify's and probably more than all streamers combined.  For some reason, most folks associate the company with siriusxm radio only.  This was the case five years ago, and a huge mistake to think now.  Today, siriusxm owns Pandora, is the leading digital ads technology  thanks to AdsWizz and Simplecast, that just surpassed 1 B monthly downloads, owns about 15% of SoundCloud, and 100% of Stitcher, on of the top 4 podcasts in the country.  I expect the share price to double already this year with Q1 to be a blowout quarter.

mt4xu3,,wallstreetbets,post,1618715304,"CBOE VIX Options: Maybe Overdo for a Sharp Move HigherHey, guys. I decided to bring out the ol' Excel to get some data on the SPY over the last 12-months to measure the money flow, and I found something super interesting.

Money flow is essentially the inflow and outflow of money coming into a particular company, asset class, or security. It's a good way of measuring market participation. Higher market participation in bullish times often takes equities to new highs, but in bearish times it becomes a drag on equity prices. When money flow oscillates in tighter intervals, we tend to see more spikes in volatility rather than when it oscillates slightly or not at all.

Let us take a lot at the SPY and the charts representing it. We have the price index, the total flows, the inflow(+) and outflow (-), and the net flow charts. Taking all of this information together, you may see where I come to the conclusion of why the market is overdue for a little more volatility, which means that VIX options are in play for the next few weeks most likely.

[This is the price index of the SPY on a per day basis over a 12-month period. We have reaching higher highs in the recent weeks while volatility has been dropping. This is a classic bearish sign for the market. Not to say that we will see a correction by any means, just a little bit more volatility, I think. Like I said, high volatility in a bull market is good. In a bear market, not so much.](https://preview.redd.it/hbfiz3fwcut61.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=4910cea6eea6159d41c54f078e49d8e623051df6)

[This  is the total flows on a per day basis over the same period of time. As you can see, volatility dropped in the most recent weeks in comparison to those before and the SPY went up. Reiterating: it's a bearish signal based on historical measurements. But expecting volatility is not the same as saying I'm a bear. I'm just seeing perhaps more swings in the weeks to come to both the downside and the upside. If we're in bullish mindset, the price will trend up. If bears take over, hold on to your hats.](https://preview.redd.it/bwqkuld1dut61.png?width=2486&format=png&auto=webp&s=a093c106910abe22916074072cb7df322f8dff17)

[This is the inflow\/outflow chart over the same period of time. Notice the higher frequency on the left-side of the chart vs the right-side. This tells me that there is higher market activity as larger volumes of inflows and outflows are happening in tighter spreads, thus giving the \\""clustered\\"" effect. As we look towards the right-side of the graph, we see a lower frequency as inflow and outflow activity isn't so active and the spreads look \\""looser.\\"" The money flow frequency can change at any moment but just be aware that the frequency starts going higher because of an event that forces it. Often that event happens after a low frequency environment. We are currently in a low frequency environment.](https://preview.redd.it/gy3vyq0idut61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbca5977189fdc9e7e6e30d1d3e55396b6a19c85)

[This graph represents the total net flows per month. The peaks \(i.e. turning points\) show where the CBOE Volatility Index \(VIX\) has stabilized. Since the last spike in the VIX around late January\/early February, we haven't seen the VIX consolidate at a bottom. The data for April is only partially available because the month isn't complete, so do not take the line upward following the last turning point as a definite sign of stabilization. However, if we can assume that the final line going upward will average the current rate of return that is already there, then we may be due for a stabilization test soon.](https://preview.redd.it/v4e4xp2ceut61.png?width=2173&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d4c0a2c3b3b7ab1c7426e42db700438c644f425)

You can see the correlations between the VIX stabilization and the net flow peaks around the period by comparing the chart above with the one below.

https://preview.redd.it/oc2wlpcbfut61.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=f599b35562d2b4494e138b98de2358ea5de66052

Based on this argument, I think we may start seeing the VIX consolidate at around this level. We're in a low frequency environment, the perfect spot for when high frequency starts to kick in. After a test of stabilization, we either see a sharp move upwards or the continuation of a slow decay before it gets retested again. Are we at a place of consolidation, or are we quickly approaching one? I don't know for certain, but I like to follow the money.

mt4xu3,guy15le,wallstreetbets,comment,1618728042,"I have been waiting for VIX to hit $15, but it seems like a lot of investors are antsy. Bonds selloff recently raised cash for those who sold. Why? Banks offered huge bond sales to raise cash. Why? London did not hide that it intended to push gold spot price up last week, but the bond to gold trade to shift cash reserve positions is not appropriate for this recovery environment. Why? Was it to pad the value to take a little edge off of a coming massive fall? Warren Buffet exited bank positions leading into a recovery, which is another strange move to raise cash. Why?

All of this tells me that big money is preparing large cash positions to support future buys. A fair case for the banks is that they need to support higher housing costs for mortgages, but that doesn't feel right to me. Banks could draw more debt from FedRes, but they chose to raise cash through traditional means. Banks also traditionally sell gold and silver, preferably near the top to front run other big sellers. I expect this to happen, and with the debt competition between banks and investment firms, and due to the dynamics of recent sovereign challenges, I expect fierce gold sells to plunge gold spot price. All of this leads me to believe that coming is a major shift of investment capital out of commodity heavy exchanges and into storefront & webmarket exchanges.

My bet is that VIX is about to double, so FOMO is adding anxiety daily.

msy7zx,,wallstreetbets,post,1618690626,"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DDI’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. 

I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.",['TSLA']

What??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.

These hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:

[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)

Their weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.

Isn’t $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math, however this may or may not unfold.

**$CLOV Short Interest:**

$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do yesterday. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to counter S3 Partners data (although S3 calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:

https://preview.redd.it/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e

[This includes CEO's shares in the float -- it shouldn't. ](https://preview.redd.it/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)

Shorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:

* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil
* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)
* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July
* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell

***What does this mean?***

What this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma fairy dust to make $CLOV move A LOT.

**Timing:**

Timing this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any good news, this would be our catalyst. 

To capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.

Inducing some gamma fairy dust so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.

Remember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation à la Archegos.

Obligatory: I am a financial degenerate and this is for entertainment purposes only; not investment advice.

msy9s3,,wallstreetbets,post,1618690782,"Explanation of the $CLOV 10k and Calculating Short Interest by handEdit: I seem to be getting downvoted a lot, yet not a single person has replied criticizing my math and the numbers....

TL;DR: The real short interest is 35.1% and the data provider which first reported 140% has changed it back to this number. Also, I apologize in advance for disrupting the echo chamber.

Over the last two days many people all over every social media platform have been in debate as to what $CLOV's real float count is and what the real short interest as a % of the Float is. I am here to explain what went wrong in FactSet's calculations (which have now been fixed BTW: [source](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)) and to calculate the float by hand using information and data provided in $CLOV's 10k to confirm the validity. Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.

Here are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:

* There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.

What is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:

Yesterday FactSet reported that float was \~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.

&#x200B;

Now for the 10k:

&#x200B;

[10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)

This 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.

Further, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.

Therefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**

Taking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:

(38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**

Now to clear up some more misconceptions:

[Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.

*Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*

It is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:

1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding.
2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III.",['MMM']

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>“Why do I need to learn this?”

It turns out, the answer is not

>“so you can become a scientist!”

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

msfygy,,wallstreetbets,post,1618618171,"I counted all the GME Yolos Part 3Hi Everyone,

In case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/)

To summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares.

**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.7 million**.

As I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter  and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimates of  silent whales :

1:9= 4,257 Silent WSB Kongs with 5,187,897 shares.

1:90= 42,570 Silent WSB Kongs with 51,878,970 shares.

Either way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding.

**TDLR: Just 473 WSB Kongs hold 576,433 shares worth 92.7M**",

I've seen some tendies get thrown around the CRISPR space lately with all the $EDIT talk which is great to see as I feel I can finally contribute something meaningful to r/WSB.  I assume you apes have had a little exposure to the Cell & Gene Therapy (C&GT) industry when you're jerkin off on the couch to Cathie Woods and her $ARKG fund while your wife and her boyfriend are in the master bedroom, but then again probably not.  So, please read the preamble before throwing your shit all over my DD.

**Key Points on Cell and Gene Therapy Industry**

C&GT is a long time in the making and many (including several Nobel prize winning) discoveries had to coalesce but the industry is finally starting to hit major inflection points. One of the major subcategories within C&GT are ""cell-based gene therapies"" like CAR-T cell therapy. A patient's (or donor's) T cell is genetically engineered to express a CAR which drives the T cell towards the cancer cells. There are 5 FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies on the market. Below is a table from Wikipedia with more info on them.

https://preview.redd.it/wk1h7t06sqt61.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=798b37452937b4018f93f1939d5794ca80d2fc1a

There are many other subcategories within C&GT and many other types of ""cell-based gene therapies"" beyond CAR-T cell therapy.  Not all of these require genetic engineering, FYI.

On January 15, 2019 commissioners from the [FDA issued a bullish statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-peter-marks-md-phd-director-center-biologics) on the C&GT industry and here are some highlights:

1. ""The FDA is witnessing a surge of cell and gene therapy products entering early development, evidenced by a large upswing in the number of investigational new drug (IND) applications.""
2. ""We anticipate that by 2020 we will be receiving more than 200 INDs per year, building upon our total of more than 800 active cell-based or directly administered gene therapy INDs currently on file with the FDA.""
3. ""And by 2025, we predict that the FDA will be approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy products a year based on an assessment of the current pipeline and the clinical success rates of these products.

&#x200B;

When you look at the [FDA's IND Receipts for Biologics](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/ind-activity/ind-receipts) in 2018, we see that 1594 INDs were filed. This was a below average year compared to the 1614 (+/-70) INDs that were filed, on average, from 2014 through 2019. It is important to remember that there was a ""surge"" of C&GT products entering the early development landscape BEFORE the pandemic because this implies that the share of C&GT IND receipts is growing in a pie of \~1600 new INDs per year. In 2020, the FDA received 2182 INDs.

The ""surge"" in C&GT products entering early development the FDA noted in their early 2019 statement was a mere prelude to the 2020 surge in C&GT therapy products entering early development as evidenced by large upswings in the number of new INDs.

Unfortunately, there are many risks involved with investing in early, mid, or late stage biologic drug developers because of their high cash burn rate and constant threat of dilution. Obviously the tendies can be nice if some of these companies get acquired but that's a tough game to play. IMO, you are much better off finding a company that provides the C&GT industry with all the reagents, consumables, and instruments that these developers and institutions use to conduct R&D and development work. **Enter, $TECH**.

[Bio-techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) is a NE Minneapolis, MN based company that has largely grown through acquisitions. It's largest subsidiary is R&D Systems, a company that has been providing research grade reagents to the biotech industry for 50 years. That brand is well known and have a great reputation. They have quietly acquired many other brands quite strategically which will enable them to service the growing C&GT industry new ways like: GMP reagents for use in the expanding clinical and commercial landscape, gene editing technology (including CRISPR/Cas9 and other non-viral methods), contract development and manufacturing services, analytical instrumentation and assays, etc. [See here for full list of Bio-techne brands.](https://www.bio-techne.com/about/bio-techne-brands) 

 

**The Metaphorical Stars Align**

Not only is $TECH a fundamentally sound company with strong analyst reviews (see my E\*Trade snapshot below), but stars are soon to be aligning that you apes need to be aware of.

**On 4/20, $TECH will break through its $420 resistance**. I mean come on, this is too good to be true right? See my shitty technical analysis below for confirmation bias. Everything seems to be lining up.

Here are my holdings of $TECH.

 **TL;DR:** If you like $EDIT, $ARKG, or any other hot cell and gene therapy companies like $CRSP, $FATE, etc. but do not want to invest in cell and gene therapy developers directly (because of risk), then $TECH is for you. Not only has $TECH supported the biotech field with reagents, assays, and instrumentation for 40 years, they will continue to take market share in the rapidly growing clinical/commercial (non-R&D) groups. Finally, their stonk will break through the $420 resistance on 4/20.",['BIO']

So what it breaks 420!

Profit ratio is small.

No thanks",

>apes and autists,

Retards and autists pls.

Also, most biotech/pharma stocks see massive movements on approval/breakthrough days. So, unless there is any potential catalyst, it's not likely that it will despite whatever your shitty 2012 4/20 memes indicate.

Also, your TA is way off. Price action shows that a reversal back down is more likely than a breakthrough.",
msrrzp,guvhjj9,wallstreetbets,comment,1618678642,Or it could crash.,
msrrzp,guuv8ht,wallstreetbets,comment,1618671015,"Just want to throw out there that as someone who works in this sector generally, R&D systems is massively dominant.

Edit: that being said, I often opt to pay more for their (privately owned) competitor's product due to the quality difference. R&D systems use what are called polyclonal antibodies for my assays, whereas use of monoclonal antibodies is better. Most of my colleagues just use R&D systems for their assays regardless.",
