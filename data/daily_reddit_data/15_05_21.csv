lv5dlb,gpbcy3e,stocks,comment,1614617395,"Swedish investor here. Been investing for about four years now. I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
> # Fed Ahead
> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
> # Retail earnings and housing
> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
> “The S&P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
> “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

> # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

Most of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.

Amazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.

Amazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.

Amazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

In April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.

Last year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.

Amazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'

ncyqua,,stocks,post,1621084843,"Risks regarding AMD?I wanted to hear your opinion about AMD. I am considering investing a large portion of my portfolio in AMD and have concerns about two specific risks:

If the mining boom slows down because the bubble has burst or something similar, I fear for the demand for graphics cards. I know it's rather partially dedicated mining cards used to mine, but to a large extent GPUs as well. Won't the used market for graphics cards then be flooded with cheap goods and the demand for new graphics cards collapse?

Also, many tech companies are starting to design their own chips, for example Apple, Microsoft and Amazon (the latter for their server business). And you can see from Apple's example that they are also very good at this.

How do you assess the two risks? Or can you think of other reasons not to buy AMD (or other chip designers)?","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'AMD']"
ncyqua,gy7ppqs,stocks,comment,1621086285,"While there is some risks for AMD with Amazon designing chips for AWS, the number of customers for AMD in the cloud and server space is quite large and so there is substantial diversification there. Large number of cloud providers won’t be able to design their own devices and ARM will never be 100% of the server market unlike the smartphone market. AMD is also well diversified into console gaming and IP licensing areas. See for example Samsung’s device using Vega. 

Regarding mining, I don’t think this is significantly material to AMD from downside risk since a bulk of the GPU business is in actual graphics use. This includes high end PC gaming, console gaming and yes also perhaps mobile gaming if Samsung’s plan comes to fruition. 

So overall risks to AMD are just the usual competitive pressures but given that the overall markets they are playing in continue to increase in size, as long as they execute they should be fine. 

Having worked in the chip industry for 25+ years there is not a whole lot of reasons not to buy into semiconductors. Semiconductor content in our lives continue to increase and while the players might change the overall industry is going to be growing and valuable over time. Just look at TI or STM or even INTC who have been around for 50 years and still going strong.

Just don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. AMD and others for that matter have struggled in the past on execution and so the stock might trade sideways or even down for a long time. 

But Dr Su has built a solid team now and hopefully these issues are in the past and won’t repeat again.","['INTC', 'IP', 'AMZN', 'AMD']"
ncyqua,gy7q4el,stocks,comment,1621086513,"I don't think demand would collapse. For one most people clamoring to get a gpu won't want a burnout mining card

Second I don't see mining going anywhere anytime soon

Third amd has been consistent in crushing intel on gaming  and value in CPUs last year ish and probably will for a few more years. 

Fourth amd has been getting closer and closer to matching/beating Nvidia in gpus. 

So even if mining collapses amd still will probably keep taking more market share from Intel and Nvidia.","['NVDA', 'INTC', 'AMD']"

Source: own 400 shares and accumulating.",
ncyqua,gy82xj9,stocks,comment,1621093002,"Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. 

Intel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. 

Hence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. 

Intel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. 

Also the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. 

As I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. 

Is NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. 

Now regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. 

And regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. 

Full disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.","['AMAT', 'AVGO', 'AAPL', 'BLL', 'AMD', 'MSFT', 'HPQ', 'INTC', 'NVDA', 'AMZN']"

My problem with Zoom is the same one I have with Dropbox. Their entire product offering is competing with products that are an add-on to ecosystems which companies likely already use.

If a company is using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure or any of the numerous Google services, why would they continue to use a separate cloud storage/video conferencing application which does nothing special?

(00:21): “... and where is Amazon’s headquarters? … 1516 Second Avenue… We didn’t see anything that looked vaguely cutting edge… Upstairs, it doesn’t look very high-tech, either. More like a college dorm than a corporate headquarters. And then there’s the boss; you generally hear him before you see him… you can afford a better desk than that… and you don’t need clean carpets.”

(06:08): “Is this investing or this gambling?”

“Right now, with the frenzy we’ve had, to me, it feels much more like gambling.”

“Because it’s crazy?”

“I don’t find it to be rational, to be honest with you.”

“But investors keep flooding in. Why? Amazon snagged almost 2 million new customers at the end of last year. And like other internet companies, it’s growing much faster than those old blue chips.”

618 million common shares outstanding x $8.11 market price = $5 billion market cap

Accumulated deficit $2.3 billion

Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $1.62 billion

===== ===== =====

The biggest change comes with WISH’s increase in logistics revenue (revenue from facilitating delivery of product). Info found in most recent quarterly report, link as above:

Three months ended March 31 (in millions USD: 2020 / 2021):

Logistics revenue: $56 / $245 (increased 337%)

Marketplace revenue: $384 / $527 (increased 37%)

Revenue: $440 / $772 (increased 75.5%)

Overview of Wish Local, which is part of its increase in logistics revenue: https://www.you----.com/watch?v=WBkP2FtSq00

Wish Local might seem like Amazon’s ability to deliver to post offices and other pickup locations, but a key difference is that Wish Local allows the pickup locations (retailers) themselves to sell their wares via the Wish App and to carry popular items from Wish, earning a commission on in-person sales.

ncihqg,,stocks,post,1621024967,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

TL/DR: wtf is going on with [http://www.buyins.com/](http://www.buyins.com/) \- the site is completely broken, no links work, latest data on the site is from like 2012, HOWEVER they randomly release recent (few days ago) reports... I would be very interested in actually using their services but it's almost impossible to actually interact/use them??

Any insight would be appreciated! I'd pay to use their services if they are actually usable...

Longer explanation:

\- I was reading a [Yahoo finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huge-naked-short-helium-explorer-144300407.html) saying ""*...Buyins.com, which allows companies and investors to see what’s really going on in the markets--recently put out a* [*shocking report*](http://www.buyins.com/news/avnnews5-10-21.pdf) *on Avanti...*"" (the ""shocking report"" link works btw - good read)

\- Immediately interested, I go to their website (check it out yourself). Almost ALL links are broken, latest dates are from years ago etc.

\- HOWEVER, doing some google searching, they do arbitrarily put out reports (very recent). My question is WTF is going on with their website/services. I am pretty much saying ""take my money!"" :) but can't figure out what this company is doing (vis-a-vis their online presence)

ncl56i,,stocks,post,1621032615,"Why I Think AMC Will Result In BagholdersAlright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.

Let’s look at liquidity:

AMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they’ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there’s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.

Next there's the valuation:

Forget covid and let’s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today’s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is $16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was $4.0b vs. $5.8b today.

Conclusion:

AMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn’t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.

The current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.

If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.

A lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it’s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme. Invest safely!",['MMM']

I don’t know why 80% of holders will want to run for the door if they really believe it’s undervalued and the price was just being pushed down. And if it’s the result of a squeeze, than an eventual price drop is pretty much in the name and anyone who’s still holding for more of a squeeze is just taking excessive risk, and also isn’t likely to be running for the doors if they’re not selling on the growth it’s seen. 

I don’t think the standard metrics really apply to meme stock holders that we’ve seen. I mean there’s always people who’ve taken, and lost on excessive risk, but it seems rather new to see people eat it, for all it’s good and bad.

For me, as a very new investor (I’m only a little over a month in, so take my word with a grain of salt), “best” are the stocks that have shown consistent, steady growth and have been minimally affected by losses. At this time, my four “best” stocks are…

4) Costco (COST) - It’s had a few swings in its price, but it’s never dipped into the red. As of this post, it’s gained 6.25% in a little over a month, and it’s already paid a dividend.

3) Goldman Sachs (GS) - I’ve only held this stock for about two-three weeks, but its growth has been spectacular. In researching, I found out it was still undervalued, and man, has it shown. Even when it tumbled, it hasn’t been a nightmarish fall. 6.5% growth already.

2) AbbVie (ABBV) - I knew nothing about this company and spent three days researching it before I bought its stock, and it’s been one of the best purchased ever. It doesn’t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%). It’s grown 8.35% in almost four weeks.

1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - First stock I ever bought. Outstanding, steady growth. Hardly has a down day. 10.8% growth in over a month. The only drawback? No dividends.","['ABBV', 'GS', 'BRK.B']"

Over the past few months of ""investing"" I realized volatility is not my friend. Maybe that is the wrong approach but I figured, I'll take the loss as a tax credit and just keep everything in VTI/SCHG and some dividend stocks.

Edit: thanks for the support

An example I’ll use is PLTR.
On March 8th it was at 22$. Analysts were saying buy buy buy. Great. So as of today, it is down 20% from March 8th. Vs VTI, March 8th it was 200, closed at 211 today so you’d be up 6%. Of course, you can wait 5 more years, and maybe PLTR will get to 40-45 again... that is if they don’t have competition, no issues with their business model... whole VTI may go up 30-35% but with less stress of worrying about an individual company... yes less risk, less reward...

Edit:
There have been some messages about ""paper hands"" etc, buy high sell low... valid points perhaps, but, 
I did this for my own self, as I realized that:
 1. I am not a person who can handle the volatility of some of these stocks, I am sure that they will go up in 1,2,3, years etc, but if they do, so will VTI / VOO / SPY.... maybe not to the same level but the road will be less bumpy
 2. This is a way to build a base of my portfolio. I will go back to stocks, but to at a much lower exposure. I do think that inflation will be an issue over the next few years and I think some of the tech stocks will be up / down for the next bit. Especially those companies that are trading at 100x their earnings, so I am sure I will have the opportunity to re-enter (again my opinion).

ncgg66,gy57kvx,stocks,comment,1621025663,"I bought 100 shares of AAPL for $14/share circa 2002/2003. Sold about a year later in the mid-$20 range thinking ""hey, I nearly doubled my money in about a year. Moving on...""

That was before iPod money starting filtering to the bottom line, and obviously several years before the iPhone even came out.

Had I held the entire time from purchase until now, I'd have 5,600 shares (after splits) worth about $713,000 at today's closing prices.

So, yeah, I'd say I sold ***way*** too soon on that one. Though I tell myself that I probably would have sold after the first 2-for-1 split and it ticked back up to around $80/share and I would have had around $16,000. But, I think I just tell myself that to make me feel better.",['AAPL']

For example, all the cruise lines diluted to high hell during COVID and issued some pretty bad bonds, some which are convertible which will dilute even more going forward. And they are foreign business and run by really nasty folks. Look up the history of cruise lines and be in awe of all the bankruptcies and how they are still controlled by the same circle of people. Basically they let their companies go bankrupt, then have their buddies buy the boats for pennies on the dollar. Then take more investor money and relist. Rinse and repeat. A lot of REITs do something like this too so be careful.

Many Hotels are up to pre-covid levels already on speculation of return to norm. The ones that arent, were not so great fundamentally even before COVID and in general, hotels are volatile and casinos have been on a down trend for a while too. Basically Macau ate a huge portion of their market (the Chinese love gambling) when it became big and now online gambling is competing with them...

I believe this will cause the exact opposite of what should happen where you should always do your own research. 

Watching youtubers that have super risky options and stocks creates a confirmation bias to do the same thing as them whereas they have more capital than most of us, and they get paid a lot of money making these YouTube videos via google adworks.

The more realistic/negative side of me is thinking. If it’s been down this long how can I tell if it’s going to stay down for a long time? Or if it will even go back up?

Taking AFRM as an example, you bought in when they were valued at roughly $21B, right? I would assume you have reason to believe they're worth $25B, or $30B, or whatever value you placed on them. Assuming nothing has changed regarding their financials, performance, whatever, you would still have that target estimate. So anything south of that would be a discount to you, and a decline in share price is irrelevant, because you have reason to believe it's worth $30B.

nc8xtf,,stocks,post,1620999841,"Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber CompaniesBased on questions I've been getting the last couple weeks, I want to share all the various sources I’ve used to keep myself educated on the industry and get my “feel” for long term exit strategies.

This post isn’t about doing EPS or IV projections.  It’s simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity, as well as any major news/opinions out there that could affect the commodity’s future direction.  

I find it **very** helpful, because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit, I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didn’t change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industry’s record profits.  I didn’t panic when futures went red the last few days, because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30% and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine.  So this “market feel” research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noise.

**Basic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber Industry**

I think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it, because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have confidence in your investment when the fundamentals are still there.

Here are two excellent podcasts from two industry insiders discussing the current state of the industry:

[Odd Lots Podcast with Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-price-of-lumber-has-soared-day-after-day-after-day/id1056200096?i=1000518629853)

[Building Optimal Podcast with Dustin Jalbert; Fastmarkets RISI Senior Economist; Episode #71]( https://buildingoptimal.com/episodes/)

Both are great podcasts to help you understand what’s causing the surge from the people that know.  Hint: it’s not due to an industry-wide conspiracy.  This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from it’s high after the summer.


**Apparently Social Media Actually has a Positive Use**

I don’t use social media, but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other non-stop about things going on in the cash markets / futures, as well as the occasional opinions.  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts.  So it’s a great way to keep yourself educated.  Also, they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see what’s going on with them any particular day.

It can be insightful (and calming on red days), especially since normal members of the public can’t see what’s happening in the cash markets real time, but sometimes these guys will let you know.  The other day, when all the futures were nose diving, cash markets were still up, meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship (which is a good thing!).

[Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://twitter.com/LumberTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – The King of Lumber Twitter.  Nice guy and great insights.  Don’t ask him what the price of lumber will be in Q4.  No one fucking knows.  

[RISI Senior Economist Dustin Jalbert](https://twitter.com/2x4caster) – Also a very prolific poster in Lumber Twitter and will share great insights.

[Forestry Insider Bryan Davis](https://twitter.com/bryandav1z) – Another knowledgeable insider who likes to share insights on the industry and some of the main lumber stocks.

[Housing expert/Chief Economist Ali Wolf](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon) – The housing market is driving this surge.  The lumber industry uses housing demand/data as the canary in the coal mind.  You probably should too.  If housing demand is still going bananas, then lumber will do so as well.

[Madison’s Lumber Prices](https://twitter.com/LumberNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – They post Lumber Cash Prices, typically about 2 weeks behind, but that’s still way ahead of whenever the company’s next earnings statements, and provides a break down by the major types of lumber.  Sometimes you even get a video interview/update.

[RISI Analyst Bryan Smith](https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en) – He tweets out when some of these forestry companies declare wood pulp price increases (which extra is a significant source of income for a lot of these companies).  I find it a helpful data point.

Those are main ones.  But if you follow these people enough, you will see them talking to other insightful people as well and sharing informative content.

**Publicly Open Websites That Help You get a Sense of Market Direction**

Here’s the link for lumber futures: [CME Lumber Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#) - This is the closest thing to a general market gauge of the lumber industry.  But this isn’t an exact predictor and this price is pegged to the Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&Btr.  There are many different types of dimensional lumber, some cost more (like Eastern SPF) and some cost less (like Southern Yellow Pine – SYP).  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally.  But remember, these prices can change.  They can go up or down, these aren’t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn’t mean it will stay that way.

[Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) – a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don’t need to panic.  

The industry’s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don’t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.

[Madison’s Lumber Reports]( https://madisonsreport.com/) If you hate twitter, here’s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.

[US Housing Data Releases](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) – US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don’t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that’s when you know the party is over.

[Shanghai Pulp futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices) – This isn’t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  [Here’s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.](https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf)

**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**

[Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  

[Whale wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/) is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F’s so it isn’t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.

Overall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.

If there is one place you *shouldn’t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it’s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending “lumber stocks.”  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.

**TLDR:** there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don’t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don’t FOMO buy just because “the sucker’s going up.”

**Disclosure:** most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.  Anyone have thoughts on what they like more LPX vs WFG long term (the next 6-18 months), please share and why.  I can’t decide which I want to buy more of.  For the Canfor/Interfor Bros out there, I don’t need to hear how cheap your otc stock is. :p","['NDAQ', 'TWTR', 'CME', 'AAPL']"

ncem0x,,stocks,post,1621014679,"Selling a position before or after 1 year ownershipI am hoping someone can tell me if I am thinking about this correctly.

I was pretty new to investing when the market crashed due to covid last year.  I bought a bunch of stocks (eg. CCL, DAL) without too much diligence just because they were down so far and I figured ""hey, this can't last forever!"".  Now as we get into May, most of them are hitting the 1 year point since purchase. 

I am looking to simplify my portfolio and own fewer tickers because I don't feel like I care to be invested in these companies anymore and I can't follow all of them.

Should I try to wait until 1 year after purchase? for instance I have a stock I purchased in June 2020.  If I wait to sell until next month, will I be better off on taxes (understanding that the prices could also move between now and then). My current thinking is if I wait one more month I will save 10% on taxes.

ncfdc2,gy5z3sf,stocks,comment,1621039652,"Yeah it kinda seems too good to be true I'd agree but I think it's worth a position, even if not a tremendously big one.

I for one started out by putting in 5k€ when I first read the DD of the dude who put in like 5 million freedom coins.
It seems like free money tbh.
I personally found the states that institutions have taken up to now pretty encouraging.
Furthermore the stock is trading with astarys already being FDA approved + level 4 drug so MUCH uncertainty is already gone but the stock hasn't moved much.

Once sales start happening that is 100%ly going to change!
The question is: will they start happening?
I think they will. The CEO and team have a proven history in this field and a bunch of private equity family offices have already developed huge positions.

The good thing about micro caps is that really big players can't take positions easily, thus making ""efficient market theory"" more difficult to work.
What I mean by that is basically that it's much easier to find an undervalued stock sub 500mill MK just because it's easier for institutions to invest in the bigger once.
They just don't bother doing research for the smaller ones.
Generally retail has the edge here but it's MUCH more risky.

I have expanded my position to about 11k€ and I have more money (5k) being wired to my brokerage ATM for another entry because I am quite bullish.
Would put more in but it's not rational to overweigh a position that theoretically is really speculative.

Financials are sweet with 0 debt and the cash that is being burned each quarter is practically nonexistent (1m).

Furthermore you got 73$million dollars CASH as of 31.3 not counting the 2x10mill that came in milestone payments since then, thus making it just short of a 100mill in cash right now.

You buy a 250mill MK company that has 100mil in cash.
This basically means that their drug portfolio is being priced at about 150mil right now which seems really fucking low to me considering the drugs that are still in pipeline and the ones that have been approved.

Astaryz has the potential to make this thing a buyout candidate or alternatively at least quadruple stock price in my humble opinion. 
1billion mk would not be overpriced for a company that can potentially generate 560m in payments from one drug alone which is being distributed by a very knowledgeable team with a bunch of know how in the field.

I hope the stuff I just wrote out makes sense, listening to music rn, so maybe I repeated some stuff but you should get the gist.

SPLV has a beta of .7 and has a yield of 1.7% https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPLV plus there are global low volatility funds to add some international exposure https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239605/ishares-msci-all-country-world-minimum-volatility-etf




also look at beta for the bond fund, they can be almost as volatile as the market which kinda defeats the purpose of adding stability. Peter Lynch of Fidelity said somewhere that bond funds can give a false sense of security. 

if longevity counts for something to her, look at DODBX, the Dodge & Cox balanced fund. established in the early 1930s it's one of the oldest mutual funds still in existence, and IIRC the oldest that's still following its original mandate: ~70% blue chips, the remainder in quality bonds. fees are reasonable, and Dodge & Cox has an absolutely spotless reputation (Jack Boggle was a fan, saying they were one of the few active managers he'd recommend due to their long-term mindset, low turnover, and high ethical standards).","['UPS', 'MSCI', 'SPGI']"

I am 20 and my current savings goals range from 15-40 years, so long term goals. 

I am not focusing on dividends, but if there’s a strong passive investing portfolio advice, that does pay a dividend I like three reinvest potential.

VTI - 37%
SCHD - 30%
VXUS - 15%
VWO - 10%
ICLN - 5

REIT - 3%

nceyzx,gy5s73x,stocks,comment,1621035849,"VTI has all the stocks in SCHD, so IMO no need to have both. if you want to keep SCHD, I'd add something with more small/mid cap because VTI has ~20% those stocks and SCHD is all large companies. (ignore the haters, there's research showing dividend paying stocks tend to outperform non-dividend stocks www.csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf)

>What advice do you have for adding a little more risk? 

do you mean ""more risk"" or ""more growth potential""? not always the same thing. there's tons of data showing small and mid-size company stocks tend to outperform everything else, over long periods. I'd ramp up the small and mid exposure https://contrarianoutlook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SPY-Midcap-Smallcap-20yr-Chart.png

there's also plenty of data showing value stocks tend to outperform over long periods (EDIT: this might be a better link: https://thebamalliance.com/blog/is-the-value-premium-really-dead/). value can under-perform for years, but over the long haul has always beaten any other strategy. EDIT: I lean towards value stocks, but you always want a mix of everything ... I have some growth stocks too. 

low-volatility stocks also tend to do very well (https://www.invesco.com/us2/factor-investing/low-volatility-factor-101/) 

I would not recommend too much in any industry-specific things like QQQ, those are overheated and IMO will not continue to outperform. 

for international, the scandanavian/nordic nations tend to be very strong performers internationally so might want to allocate a bit to them (https://novelinvestor.com/international-stock-market-performance/). the emerging markets ETF is a good choice, emerging markets are so cheap right now that they'll do very well few years (according to Jeremy Grantham).",['IVZ']

It's a fairly conservative portfolio for how young you are. Consider QQQM, QQQJ, IWO for more growth-oriented options. 

I'm of the opinion that VXUS and VWO are trash - it's a global economy, so they follow more or less the same trendline (with perhaps less volatility) as US markets for the privilege of higher expenses and lower returns. Someone can disillusion me on that if I'm wrong, though.",
ncege4,,stocks,post,1621014266,"Retirement planLong story short, I was talking to one local multi-millionaire and he told me the story behind his fortune when he was a bit tipsy. He's in his 60s. So, this guy claims he never was really the wealthiest guy out there, quite the opposite he was working hard to survive from month to month like most people, saving some small amounts of money to buy himself a car or house over the years. I was actually amazed because everyone knows that at the moment he's a multi-millionaire, so I asked him directly how is this possible that he's a millionaire if he never really got any fortune in his life, and that was the moment he told me   
'son, you're still young, I'll give you the advice I've had got from one of my late old friends back day. Put $100 on stocks every week, that's it. That's not much, you won't even feel it missing, but over the years your money will be stacking, and be growing over the years. That's how I became a millionaire after cashing it a few years ago.'   
He said that he invested in some copper company.

1) is such a strategy really worth it?  
2) if so what companies are worth putting your money into long term?  
3) should I go on the market alone \[via robinhood\] or perhaps use some investment groups?

My personal opinion is that we are currently seeing a lot of money chasing too few opportunities. In general, companies don't need investor money as much as they used to. It used to be (30+ years ago) that for a company to make money they had to have a bunch of factories, equipment, and personnel. That all took a lot of capital which they would raise from investors. Nowadays you have companies like Facebook and Google, which still require capital, but nowhere near the degree to which companies of their size would have 50 years ago. As a result, you have companies requiring less investment, and people with boatloads of money looking to invest. That is generally driving the price of all investments higher and higher, personally I think we're gonna see some really meh returns in the coming decades.",['FB']

one item you can sell for double your purchase price. you earned a 100% profit. but the other item, you can't sell. nobody wants it. 

where did your money go? well, your money went to the purchase of assets. one of the assets gained in value, the other lost its value. it's not like your money vanished into thin air. you traded your money for something else. but because a stock isn't like a diamond ring, you make a false mental connection that it somehow is like money in a bank account.",

ncotuc,,stocks,post,1621045407,"Huya: severely undervalued.Huya: The most undervalued company in the market.

https://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya had been hit with the perfect storm of terrible news. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

This is bad for Huya? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

If you have a bear case, please share.","['PEG', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']"

nbqhfy,,stocks,post,1620937483,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday’s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

Jeanine Wai -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question probably maybe for Rob. I just want to make sure I heard your comments right in the prepared remarks.

So getting down to the mid-20 billion range on gross debt, that's where you think you need to be to hit IG status at mid-cycle prices. And I think ultimately, that's an important goal for you all. So about 10 billion more to go from there. Can you just remind us what your view of mid-cycle prices are at this point? And how does this jive with your prior target of three times leverage as the trigger for growth, which I think was also at mid-cycle prices?

Rob Peterson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's around the $50 range. And if you look at the price decks that are being used by a lot of rate agencies, they're in the high 40s right now to look to close to $50. They're not -- so they don't move their price decks with the current environment of being in the mid- to high -- low 60s.

And so that makes a significant difference on where that breakeven location is at. And so is it exactly 20 -- $10 billion? Obviously, there's a lot of different things to factor, as I indicated in my remarks, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of that. It's somewhere -- other things will go into that. It could mitigate it to be a little higher than that would be possible or even a little lower than that.

But obviously, there's a lot of things that go into it, but it's somewhere in that range. So even though that you can probably move forward and get pretty close to that or lower that three times in your model for the second half of the year. But by the end of the year, based on -- if current oil prices were to continue, it's not that price deck that we're going to be considered for investment-grade.""",['OXY']

During the annual shareholders meeting on March 9, Disney announced 100 million D+ subscribers.

Q2 ended April 3. Disney reports 103.6 million D+ subscribers. This growth of 3.6 million over a month is pretty on pace with the 3 million per month between January and March.

The average forecast from analysts was 109 million D+ subscribers. Are these analysts completely ignoring data provided directly by Disney? This estimate miss is by far the biggest narrative from Disney's earnings and is in every headline. I don’t get how they can be so off, and the market selling off in response. 

I can only assume these analysts looked at Q4 2020 to Q1 2020 (73.7 to 94 million subscribers) and based something off that. But analysts not only should know better, they do. I researched bearish analysts on Disney after their Q1 results, and they were all aware this large bump for Q1 came from Disney’s purchasing of Hotstar in India. So a growth of 20+ million per quarter, per analyst knowledge, shouldn’t have been typical.

Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I’m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought. Thanks in advance. 

Basically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company’s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. 

But with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I’m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don’t see how much more they can reasonably fall.

It expects to sell about 8 million electrified vehicles globally by 2030, of which 2 million will be battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.*

if anyone really thinks the markets , infrastructure, customer sentiment will change in thenext 2-5 years, they need to wake up. 

central europe - as an example - probably has the most advanced and stable electrical infrastructure in the world. yet, its nowhere near capable of supplying an ""all EV demand.""

and its not the charging stations that are lacking (well, not only them) but the infrastructure needed to supply enough charging stations. 

add to that the battery issues of longevity, performance fluctuations depending omn temperature levels, recycling of batteries, limited materials for those batteries... 

there needs to be significant improvements in all of these aspects to be made for EV to really provide an alternative. 

the environmental impact of EV´s - compared to ICE cars is far worse. EV´s will not be the end all be all solution to the planets eco- and energy problems. 

EV tech and TSLA as the flagbearer - in my personal oppinion- is nothing more than a wakeup call and proof of concept that a whole indusry COULD change faster than expected. if enough pressure is applied.

ncj5z4,,stocks,post,1621026772,"I don't understand $TSLAI first began investing in TSLA in mid 2018. I bought some puts thinking that this company was outrageously overpriced; net loss every quarter in 2017, enormous overhead costs that keep growing, ridiculous and practically non-sensible P/E ratio and a CEO whom even back then I'm surprised has not been arrested already. Every fundamental about this company point to it being grossly overvalued yet the stock price just won't go down; it just kept skyrocketing. Eventually around early 2020, I caved in and bought some calls. I thought clearly the market saw something behind this company that I'm not seeing and there appears to be a lot of momentum so I figure I'd just join in on the FOMO. I made tens of thousands (maybe not a whole lot but a non insignificant amount) buying calls and it seemed like TSLA was going to the moon. To this day, I still don't understand why. The best explanation I've found is that people are investing the man himself, despite the Tesla the company being nothing unique even back in 2017-2018 and even less so now. 

  

Fast forward to early 2021. I still had 200 calls at $790 and TLSA suddenly began to crash. This company which showed unrelenting momentum suddenly started plummeting, costing me all my gains from before and then some. From what I read, it seems to be due to increased competition, slowdown of sales particularly in China and \[potentially\] manipulating earnings via BTC trades. Essentially, what I'm interpreting from the TSLA's current bear market is that the fundamentals have caught up, but it still begs the question: why now? Fully electric vehicles are not and have not been unique to Tesla; relying on sales from China is sketchy and incredibly risky especially with US-China relations at an all-time low even before COVID; and the company has had sketchy earnings quarters before but every time, the stock just seemed to bounce back and then some quickly after. The fundamentals that point to Tesla being a shit company were in from of us the whole time and just now the market decides to focus on that instead riding the FOMO? And what was the FOMO even about anyway? Musk may own other companies but do people actually think he's going to invest earnings from those companies into Tesla? At the end of the day, Tesla's business is selling cars and they've been struggling to fill orders.  

  

  

TL;DR what's the deal with TSLA? How can this stock that just kept going up suddenly lose so much momentum despite the underlying fundamentals being largely the same?  

  

  

Secondly, what's the view of TSLA now? I've spent a portion of my remaining funds on 100 puts at $510. If you think that's a wrong move, then I'll back now and just forget about investing altogether since clearly I don't know enough and am not qualified to be investing in the first place.",['TSLA']

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

nazu9q,,stocks,post,1620854657,"Inflation explained like you're fiveI started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.

Let's say, currently the inflation is 0%, a burger costs $1 and a single stock  share of any company costs $20. You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that share.

Tomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.

The government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.

Now let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.

You remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.

The SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.

So, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.

You've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks.",

nbzzps,,stocks,post,1620965419,"fundamental conflict between cyclicals and long term capital gainsThis rotation away from tech has me thinking.  Investors are encouraged to hold stocks for at least a year before selling on a lower rated capital gains tax.   Yet, by the nature of cyclical trends (\~6-8 months from what I am seeing), it is very difficult not to sell before the rotation.   Its also very hard to tell if you have a unicorn or not because ALL stocks seem to withdraw due to the cyclical rotation and its a crapshoot where you will end up (see 3 examples below).   That seems to be the hardest part of investing.

$CRSP:  Bought at $35 March 2021.   High was $200ish.   Fell under $100 recently

$DNMR:  Bought at $19 around October 2021 I think.   High was $63.  Now at $16.   I dumped my DNMR at $20.

$NIO:  Bought at $10.   High was 55 I think?   Now at 30 and possibly headed down to 27.

My point is that its very challenging to hold for a year bc you dont know what the cyclical rotation will do to your stock and the cyclical rotation seems to last quite a long time.   Will you still be up?   Will you be back to square one?   Will you be approaching a loss?

It seems to me that this whole cyclical rotation makes it a real challenge to hold for a year for long term capital gains.

Am I overthinking this?   Does anyone else struggle with the same issue?  Its something that I am only now beginning to understand and really need to think about.   I was very naaive thinking I could keep everything in my portfolio when everything was up 4 months ago.   I thought I curated the perfect portfolio for a 1-year hold.  Maybe I will go buy some bank stocks so they can be down in a year

The only times it’s traded at a lower PS ratio than this post 2017 were Dec 2018, Aug 2019-Jan 2020 and March 2020 - May 2020. If you bought this stock in June 2020 or February 2020 you were buying it at an 8 PS ratio which is a higher valuation than what it is today.

Let’s compare this to PYPL. PYPL is growing at a steady 30% Y/Y and currently trading at a 12 PS ratio. SQs revenue growth Y/Y for the latest quarter is 266% and for the 2 previous ones it was over 100% for both. So SQ is growing revenue this fast yet trading at 2/3 the value of PYPL

Also in June 2020 PYPL reported 5.26 billion in revenue and had a market cap of around 180 billion, last quarter SQ reported 5.06 billion in revenue and has a market cap of 89 billion

With a valuation like this how much more will these growth stocks sell off? and why are people afraid to buy more with bargains like this

Edit: I don’t know where people’s brains are, they don’t understand how fast software as a service can grow, Bitcoin is 9% of their revenue, if they lost all that than ok a 9 PS ratio?

*Current situation*: everyone appears to be convinced that we will be plagued by crazy inflation in the near future

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/americans-fear-highest-inflation-in-nearly-a-decade.html

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/13/top-bank-of-england-economist-warns-of-1970s-style-price-inflation

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/upshot/inflation-is-here-what-now.html

*Idea*: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down.

You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I’m a moron or not.


*Question*: how do I bet on deflation? The idea I had was to take the short side of some of the inflation assets, but a short play is not sustainable for a retail investor on the long term due to daily fees.

FYI, I’m new to this, just started last week. When I was looking into what stocks to invest in, I kept reading news about the fear of inflation, which eventually was confirmed yesterday with the CPI report. 

But prior to this, while doing my research and reading about the fear of inflation, I looked up what kind of stocks to invest in during an inflation, and 'commodities' seemed to be a very common answer. 

So looking at companies dealing in commodities, I narrowed my list down to $CLF, $FCX, and $WY. I did see that they were trading at their all time highs at the time, so I read into their outlook, which basically said that given the rise in demand in the commodities they deal in and the bottleneck in supply, these stocks should continue their trend this year. So I got a few call options- 1xCLF 5/21 $20C, 2xCLF 5/28 $22.5C, 1xFCX 5/28 $43C, 1xWY 5/28 $39.5C- all by Monday morning.

Yes that's the same pipeline that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is/was protesting because they were worried the project could contaminate their drinking water/the environment among other concerns. The tribe has an ongoing legal case against ET and is seeking to have the pipeline shut down. The U.S. District Court for D.C. ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an environmental review of the project. There was a chance the the pipeline would be shutdown while the review happened and could last until 2022, but recently the USACE determined that the pipeline did not need to be shut down while the review was conducted. On top of that they had excellent Q1 earnings summarized below, and have had strong, recent insider buying. Overall the fundamentals look strong, the pipeline will probably not be shut down, and it's not too late to hop on board this rocket.

I personally think, that if from China to the US everybody is on board with changing the energy production to renewables and the strong development of the sector despite the pandemic in 2020, it should be very likely, that we see at least a strong decade for renewable energy stocks.

While researching what stocks are best positioned to profit from Governments trying to make a switch in energy production and at the same time are relatively stable during inflation and rising interest rates, I came to the conclusion, that I wanted to invest in companies that are already profitable an so well financed, that they are able to pay out dividends.

While the US market is relatively small for such companies, countries that are more advanced in their energy production do have some stocks that fit. Europe, Canada and China are clearly ahead in renewables and I would love to get some inspiration on where to look for more companies like this.Also I would be very interested in feedback on the stocks I have come up with doing my own DD.

* **Revenue** was RMB187,395 million (US$28,602 million), an increase of 64% year-over-year. Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue would have grown 40% year-over-year to RMB159,952 million (US$24,413 million).

If the stock hasn't done that, why would you pick an individual stock and introduce more risk to yourself? what are the chances that a stock would beat the index if it hasnt even done that in the past? of course given there are no major catalysts that would launch the earnings/revenue into the stratosphere compared to the past. 

This of course applies to stocks which have been around for a while and havent seen multiples in revenue/income growth. Slowly and gradual revenue/income increases dont matter, because the market also grows slow and steady. Then of course there are other reasons like major changes to market like increasing steel/lumber prices in the economy which benefit steel/lumber industries.

for example, Coca cola (KO) has increased 20% in the past 5 years versus VTI growing 100% - why would anyone buy it? even in a market crash in 2020, it crashed harder than VTI.

Money that goes into them is not taxed. I believe my current tax rate is ~28%, so logically just by investing in my 401k over a brokerage account I’m basically getting an instant 28% gain on my investment?

Or is a 401k taxed differently than a brokerage account when you withdraw, making that not the case?

Even though my 401k doesn’t have the best options of funds to pick from, it seems unlikely that I would be able to beat the market by that much picking individual stocks. 
Not even taking the employer match or extra 28% of compounding into consideration. 


So shouldn’t people be doing enough 401k to get the maximum employer match, then maxing an IRA for the year, then go back and max the 401k, before they even touch a regular brokerage account? And even then probably a HSA before a standard brokerage account?

Clearway Energy; the yieldco, not the developer. I recommend you look at including a few yieldco in general, these are essentially the operating vehicles of completed power generation infrastructure. In simple terms, the wind or solar farm has been built (=derisked!) and is operating, generating a return. You buy these for the dividend returns, not necessarily growth. 

Siemens Energy; big player in renewable generation, but also in smart grids, storage - all very important to make the transition into renewables work.

NextEra Energy; solid pipeline of renewable projects, set up for growth. 

Orsted; as above; developer. The dominant force in offshore wind for years to come

Aker Offshore Wind; bit of a bet. They have set themselves up for dominance in floating offshore wind. I'm a firm believer, but it's fair to say this is a riskier bet

BP; a controversial one, I know. But big oil money is needed to accelerate the renewables transition and they are going to change the playing field. BP is making the right moves, but yes, you're still putting your money into big oil for the time being... Also good dividend return.

ncp9na,,investing,post,1621047062,"Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trendshttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth.",['DG']

(Context)

My wife and I are wanting to investing in both stocks and real estate so we can achieve FIRE. So we started researching on YouTube, books and podcasts of successful investors and found a ton of great value. BUT we noticed a trend of content being suggested to us about the ""Next market crash"" or ""Real estate is over priced! It's about to drop!"". All this BS clickbait content is annoying but I give it a listen and the content is convincing of a market crash actually happening.

My question and TLDR for seasoned investors

Has media always been talking about ""The Next market crash"" for decades? Or is this time different? Or is it all bullshit noise most of the time? It always seems like there's a ""This time it's different"" comment but I questions it's legitimacy.

nbxa4m,,investing,post,1620956413,"A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs Coinbase, DoorDash, Bumble, Wish, and Coupang record all-time low stock prices this weekNote: this post has been expanded from the 5 companies in the title to 11 companies also including Snowflake, Airbnb, Qualtrics, Affirm, Deliveroo and Opendoor.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings.",['ARKK']

That means if you bought $300,000 worth of the ETF with $100,000 of capital, you will get a margin call when the value of your shares drops to $290,000 (by then you'd have a net liquidation value of $90,000).

That out of the way, there is the potential that AMT may need to be payed when you exercise ISO shares.  My understanding is that ISO shares can also receive preferential tax treatment under certain conditions.  (Mostly involving how long since grant date and how long the shares are held post-exercise.) I suggest figuring out that info and doing the math based on your own personal situation. (AMTs also generally have different rules for tax deductions.  They certainly have their own rates and brackets.)

Seems to me that there's an advantage to waiting and seeing when it comes to ISOs though.  Unless you're in a rush to cash out, you can sit on your options (I'm assuming they're not near expiration) and wait for either IPO or acquisition, then look at the value then.  Nothing guarantees that funding rounds or IPO will make the price go up, after all.  As it stands, the option is at-the-money, meaning there's no real advantage to exercising now.

Assuming the price does go up, you are pretty much going to have to pay capital gains taxes anyway.  AMT or no AMT, Uncle Sam is gonna get his cut of the profits.  I strongly suggest you look up capital gains taxes alongside AMT.  (I wouldn't forget state taxes either.)  Also, in theory, AMT can come back to you in later years.

TLDR: Figure out Short Term vs Long Term capital gains tax.  Then figure out how AMT interacts with them.  After that, think real hard about where you think the price will go and about how certain you are.",['AMT']
ncgfqa,,investing,post,1621019470,"Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March DataFears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.

Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.

Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.

James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.

The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.

By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 

March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""

Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued.",['TWTR']

This is everything I've heard, but I'm just believing it less and less.

I did a quick test here just on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7xOheId6-4rdjC6HHa-hemlfH7u6SZGT9d6i8cXVYU/edit?usp=sharing). In short here is the performance of $100,000 (dates are rough, not the definitive start and end dates of the period in the titles)

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).",['GOOGL']

nbqj5j,gy12lrp,investing,comment,1620942542,"There's two valid principles embedded in the standard glide path wisdom: 

* Risk can be expressed as volatility (and therefore risk tolerance can be expressed via leverage, as it's more or less a straight multiplier on volatility). As your liabilities come due (i.e., you're about to retire), you should be de-risking (aka de-leveraging). 

* Diversification between uncorrelated assets improves risk-adjusted returns.

I believe the glide path wisdom is a way to package these principles in an imperfect but marketable way for the average investor. The bond component (usually investment-grade, short to intermediate duration, so low risk overall) somewhat serves the purpose of cash (100/0 -> 60/40 is like going from 1X to 0.6X). And you're bumping up your risk-adjusted return over time. All while staying away from actual leverage, which is a boogeyman to most people.

Bridgewater's beta portfolio and other risk parity frameworks implement these principles more directly, in a way that makes more sense to me. The bond component would be allocated such that its risk is on par with the equity component (it may be closer to 80% bonds and 20% stocks than vice-versa), and then leverage is applied to target whatever level of risk you want. For bonds, these portfolios usually use treasuries because a) credit risk is more correlated to equity risk than term risk (AGG has both and therefore would be more correlated to stocks than say IEF), and b) treasury futures is an excellent way to achieve leverage. Usually other assets are included as well to account for regime changes, including ones where stock/bond correlation increases; the glide path may be a product of its time, in which stocks and bonds were anti-correlated while both maintaining excess return due to falling R*.",['DE']

nc8k9r,,investing,post,1620998751,"Value-investing perspective/advice to someone that just swallowed the S&P black pill?I posted some of this yesterday and didn't get much traction in daily questions of r/investing, so I'm going to rework it for this sub:

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

Grantham and Hussman have been negative on markets for literally 20 years now.  Water is wet, sky is blue, grantham and hussman think markets are overvalued.

nc2i7c,,investing,post,1620975834,"Exxon Mobile - upcoming annual vote contested to push company in greener directionWondering what everyone's thoughts are on the upcoming Exxon annual vote that's being contested by a group called Engine No 1? They are seeking to break up the current board and vote in 4 of their own candidates in order to push the company into a greener direction. To grab a quote off their [website](https://reenergizexom.com/), ""ExxonMobil lacks a plan to create shareholder value in a world that seeks to decarbonize"".

I'm not really a seasoned investor, but I generally agree that Exxon stock has been underperforming for years partly because of increased demand and feasibility of cleaner energy, and the end of the petroleum energy's dominance is encroaching (we're inevitably going to run out of the stuff). The only ""green"" move by Exxon has been to invest heavily in carbon capture and storage; which is fine, but I'd like to see Exxon soon put together a solid plan to gradually transition out of strictly petroleum and get more involved in wind, solar, and other renewables - I'm most likely being really naive here.

In theory I like Engine No 1's objective but I guess my main concern is how effective or sincere they would be in their push for green and cleaner energy? Maybe they're just some investment firm using all this as an opportunity to place their own members on Exxon's board who'll just cash in and ultimately won't fulfill their stated objectives? I honestly don't know, and Engine No 1 probably won't get the votes they're looking for anyway. I'm anticipating that at some point I'm going to eventually divest from Exxon while putting more of my money into clean energy ETFs or something.

Anyone want to share their opinions or insights on any of this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you all for the comments and discussion. I'm learning a lot from everyone's input, not just about the outlook of oil production and oil companies in the coming years but also on how to approach these sort of contested votes as well. Much appreciation.

Charlie Munger invests in Alibaba (approx. 165,000 shares) [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html)

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

**TLDR:** In a land of unattractive valuations in the current stock market environment, Alibaba with a forward P/E of \~20 seems extremely attractive for a long term investment despite short term volatility.","['WU', 'AMZN']"

nbkfox,,investing,post,1620922698,"ABNB price has been weak and how low you think ABNB will be?Experts:

I have been watching ABNB price movement for a while, and it has been trending lower since Feb 2021. The price moved from $200ish to $134.  I initially purchased ABNB at $149ish and wanted to add more.  How low do you think ABNB will be?  According to a Motley Fool article, ABNB sold 51,551,723 million class A share at $68, and almost 80% of the shares are held by insiders and can't be sold until after the company reports earnings for the first quarter of 2021 on May 13. Even if we have a positive earning report  today, I tend to think that the lockup expiration could force the price even lower. I plan to buy more share at or around $110, but I feel like it could go even lower than that.  Thank you for sharing your input.

**Update:** Lock-up will be lifted on May 17.

Performance relative to analyst estimates: 

Revenue: $887 million vs. $719.8 million expected.

Net loss: $1.2 billion vs. $341 million expected.

Loss per share: $1.95 vs. $1.10 expected.

Gross booking value: $10.3 billion vs. $7.47 billion expected",

nbcn9g,,investing,post,1620898075,"Why is inflation bad for stock's?As the title suggests, I am really wondering why inflation is bad for stock's and why is everybody ""panicking"".
As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stocks because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

And maby a high inflation might make it more difficult for companies to make profits but that's all I can think of. 

So, why be scared? The real scary part of inflation should drive you into stocks not out of it.

I could save my money and buy a second juicer and ice machine and open a second stand in a different neighborhood,  but intrest rates are near zero so I borrowed money from the bank and open a second stand and I've doubled my sales and profits minus a little bit to make the loan payments. My investors are happy. 

I've got my eye on another two locations,  but I get hit by a double whammy, the bank is going to charge me a higher interest rate for a new loan and the price of lemons and sugar have gone up so I'm only making 10 cents per cup.   The people in the neighborhood haven't gotten a raise so it's hard for me to raise prices so I don't open up any new neighborhoods.   My growth rate is flat,  or maybe even down if people are paying more at the grocery store and have less money to spend on lemonade.  If my sales drop far enough I may not even be able to pay my loan payments and I'll go bankrupt. 

That's why higher intrest rates are bad for growth stocks as a general rule, and not as bad for stocks with pricing power that have needed products.",['ICE']
nbocck,,investing,post,1620932304,"Let’s discuss covered calls.If you are investing covered calls or are interested in them let’s discuss it on this forum. 

I have recently gotten into covered calls because I like the risk reward that they offer. 

Let’s break down what covered calls mean. 

A covered call is when you buy 100 shares of stock and then sell a call contract. 

Covered means that you own the 100 shares so you are not using leverage since you own all shares of the contract. 

Calls are options that allow a buyer to collect profits after the price hits the strike price. 

When you do covered calls you sell these options on the options market. 

When you sell an option you get paid for the option to buy the stock at your strike price. I like setting my strike a few dollars above the current price. 

When the deadline of the option passes this contract expires. If the stock price is below the strike price then you keep all your shares plus the cost of the option. If it expires above the strike price then you give that money back to the person who purchased your option. 

Even if you have to pay someone that purchased your option that is a good thing as it means that you have recieved maximum profit on your trade. 

Worst case scenario the stock price drops. In this scenario you would be better off than the guy that just held 100 shares because you are also holding 100 shares but unlike a normal stock buyer you were able to collect the premium from when you sold the option. 


I love covered calls",

nbhwdk,,investing,post,1620916062,"Criteo Earnings Update - Progressing in the right directionI wrote about Criteo’s DD in February, pointed out why the company is a hidden gem among adtech companies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B. 

- Google/Apple privacy updates will benefit those adtech companies that already owns 1st Party data, in this case Criteo is very well positioned. Criteo’s ecommerce reach is around $2B/day and enjoys exclusive access to major retailers/publishers. 

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt. The company is having a buyback program of up to $100m this year, which has been used by $5m in Q1. 

Because of the above reasons, I believe Criteo provides good risk/reward as an investment.","['HD', 'AAPL']"

I'm 28 and as many others also have I have started to be serious about investing in the stock market with savings accounts interest rates so low. I'm UK based and can invest 20k/yr within an ISA wrapper to avoid taxes on capital gains. 

I own a house, have approx 220k on my mortgage which has a locked in rate of 1.84% for the next 4.5 years. I have student debt of approximately 17k at 1.25%. I don't have any finance on cars etc. 

I have around 25k in savings and have kept back 10k as a rainy day fund so have 15k available to invest. 

I was originally planning on buying in at around £500/week in various funds to try and avoid lump summing it and then markets tanking (like they seem to be potentially doing currently!) 

My time horizon is initially around 7-8 years when I plan on upgrading the house, then long term towards retirement. Currently working full time in a secure job.

I realise I'm really lucky to have this opportunity to hopefully try and invest my money wisely but it seems there's a lot of uncertainty currently with post Covid recovery/inflation etc. My risk tolerance is fairly high I feel but probably hard to say until you experience it). 

Over the past few days there's been a fairly big tech sell off it seems and a lot of panic/fear. 

Would anyone consider a different approach to averaging in my money over the next 6 months? Would you put a decent lump sum in after corrections downwards?

Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",

nb3f9x,,investing,post,1620864506,"Holding USD vs. EUR right now.I'm a US citizen living in the Eurozone. I hold both currencies for obvious reasons.

Right now I'm overweight in USD as that's where I have most of my non-short-term savings. I'm wondering, however, if it wouldn't make sense to exchange some of these dollars for euros and hold those instead.

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

The next question is if it would make sense, as I've said, to hold more euros instead of dollars.

Obviously there's a lot of factors to consider besides inflation, especially the forex relationship that I don't quite understand.  Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?

There's also other risks like the US dollar potentially being more reliable, etc.

Any thoughts or insight is appreciated.  This sort of micromanagement may be more trouble than it's worth since I'm not sitting on millions (lol), but I figured I'd ask and see what sort of knowledge I can glean.  Thanks!",

nb3f9x,gxxc9ts,investing,comment,1620868121,"With regards to this: ""Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?""

It would cause the US dollar to depreciate with respect to the euro (assuming there is higher inflation in the US as you suggested). Currency depreciation and inflation are two sides of the same (increasingly worthless) coin.",
nb3f9x,gxxjwmx,investing,comment,1620871848,"It's really hard to predict currency moves. 

Inflation in the US can also mean that the Fed is more likely to raise rates sooner, which will make the dollar a lot stronger, quickly.

I have a similar issue, having to hedge a couple of currencies (including EUR), and I do it by buying a bit more stocks from companies based in the respective countries/regions which presumably offsets some of the currency risk, while keeping me invested. I've done the same with bonds before (BND vs. BNDX), but that's kind of lame right now due to the low interest rates.",
nabnrv,,investing,post,1620778132,"Cathie Wood: Deep Dive Into Her 20+ Year Performance HistoryHow could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

Notes: During the 2008-2009 market crash**, Cathie exits CHCIX and starts to manage the AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (ALTFX)**, with some period overlapping while new management is onboarded for CHCIX. I have no information as for the management shuffle, only what I see on Morningstar.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: -1.96%

-   VGT: 13.73%

-   IWF: 7.01%

-   PRNHX: 7.79%

&nbsp;

**2017: Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

nau5r6,gxvvk6c,investing,comment,1620844830,"> The bond markets arent buying the inflation fears it seems.

They really haven't been from the start, it's mostly just some of the more retail oriented news outlets and a bunch of people on reddit that push that idea.  I consume a lot of professional commentary and I have yet to see anyone in the industry discuss actual concerns over inflation.  

This, among other things, is just illustrative of the strong disconnect between media/social media and market participants.",
nash4a,,investing,post,1620835947,"I was bored and thinking about Ark funds. So I decided to do a breakdown to see how much of each fund is represented within ARKK. Figured I'd share if anyone else was interested.Hi all, 

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one. 

Anyway thought this was a fun exercise and figured I'd share if anyone else were interested. 

Long story short is ARKK is actually a pretty good sum of all of the other funds. If you want to keep it simple, just go with ARKK.",['ARKK']

When (if) we get this pandemic under control there will be a lot of older folks moving out of their homes and moving into senior living communities.  

I had been calling around looking for a place for my folks, and I have been getting bombarded with sales people looking to fill vacancies at the senior living facilities.  In talking with them a bit they were saying that they have quite a lot of available capacity.

n9zazb,,investing,post,1620746022,"Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

Couple key things: as you gain wealth it is inevitable you will have lifestyle creep. Some have souls of monks and do fine, others will never reach point of “satisfaction” because the creep grows faster than assets. Most of us fall somewhere in between. Don’t be surprised if your final “number” is much higher than when you first calculated it.

Second thing is as you get closer to your number and pass it, your money worries transform from “return on assets” to “return of assets”. Highly speculative plays become less attractive and shit people laugh at here like bonds become more attractive.",

QE on it's own is probably long-term disinflationary since it enables lower cost of capital which generally pushes more commodity supply into the market relative to unchanging demand.

Fiscal stimulus on the other hand is very inflationary. And even more inflationary than fiscal stimulus are supply shocks and constraints. Supply side inflation is more pernicious than demand-based inflation, although it usually tends to be more self-correcting.",

nak73r,gxuxu5w,investing,comment,1620830965,"How far should i diversify my investments? 

i know diversification is really important, but i’m only 18, heading into college in the fall. i have $4k in my roth ira and a few hundred in crypto. 

my roth contains a 60/40 blend of VTI and VXUS. i also have a few hundred dollars floating around across bitcoin, ethereum, and a few other coins. 

i know that investing in myself is most important at my age but money can’t really do that. my job pays decently well- around $215 a week. over the summer i’m going to crank up my hours which will increase my weekly paycheck to around $325. 

i’m making more than enough to max out my ira, all with $1250 in emergency money split between my checking and savings account. i also just acquired a credit card so my next goal is to build up my credit, but that will come over time as i buy things i need.

how else can i diversify my money? should i throw my extra money into a seperate brokerage account with the same 60/40 VTI/VXUS split or are there other ways i can invest?",

nadzhy,,investing,post,1620785496,"Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/sam-zell-buys-gold-with-inflation-reminiscent-of-the-1970s

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",

n9zur3,gxqv6rl,investing,comment,1620750585,"PLTR is a real growth stock with real affirmations of their projections and value with development of tech and time. 

I'm not a fan of the PLTR meme train or whatever, and after following some investor day bananas and their demo days and whatnot, I still don't understand whatever the hell they really do, but I can see it's state-of-the-art stuff that will continue to ""lock-in"" contracts for the future

Literally the only problem with this stock, at least in my eyes, is their overwhelming float of shares - but I'm not sure if this or the market cap really matters, it's an extremely high-volume and liquid stock that will probably have ~40-50% solid gains annually (so long as we don't tank by mid-2022, which of course remains a possibility on the table at current valuations anyway).

I have 0 shares, considered buying in at ~16 pre-market today, but missed the boat. Will probably consolidate at around 18-19 for the remainder of the month unless we get a bull charge in the coming weeks (doubtful).",
narr02,,investing,post,1620834154,"Western Digital - The Next NvidiaAs the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.","['FB', 'WDC', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMZN']"

n9snsw,gxpqg7e,investing,comment,1620730170,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are dropping this morning, with tech and small caps leading the way lower. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 already down 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. S&P 500 futures down 0.8%. Dow Industrials 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0635.

This follows another day of selling in tech. The Nasdaq was down 2.5% yesterday, its worst day since March. The index is now down 4% this month. Sell in May? Well, Dow Industrials are up 2.5% and the S&P is green as well (barely).

This begs two questions: 1. What’s causing the tech sell-off? 2. Is it a buying opportunity?

The former appears to be this ‘rotation trade’ into cyclicals (and staples). I suspect interest rate hikes are starting to be priced in as well. The latter I discuss on the audio.

na82fc,,investing,post,1620768033,"How will the business around selfdriving trucks may look?Everyone talks about electrification of cars, and that cool self driving feature, where you can sit back and watch a movie with your family. And yes, that's pretty neat. The car manufacturer have to change a big chunk of their product (but not all), batteries will take a big part and all around the world, the whole industry will shift. Some new players appear, some will grow and some will die. But I think this won't be a big market interruption (like the smartphone industry with apps and internet to-go), but more of a slower change.

But something I think might highly interrupt the market in a very short time, will be self driving trucks. And that's what I'd like to hear your opinion about.

The first thing that comes to mind is *yea cool, you don't need to pay a driver and spare $40,000 a year*. But that's too short sighted. You think a company who owns 10 trucks and 10 drivers now, suddenly will own 10 trucks and 0 drivers? I don't think so.

From my personal experience with trucking: The company I work for builds specialized machinery for our customers. When it's time for delivery, we have scheduled the amount of trucks we need (1-5), the time for pick up, delivery and location anywhere in europe (I'm from germany btw). We usually use the same trucking company, because they're close by and we've already established a business relationship with them. 

But this needs a lot of pre planing. If manufacturing is delayed, the delivery will be delayed, the trucking company needs to hold back truck & driver and so on.

With self driving trucks it doesn't matter. No driver to keep on hold. You don't need a trucking company 'close by', because there is no homebase for a self driving truck every few days. This might doesn't sound big, but it basically opens up the door for an Uber-like trucking company, availability like a taxi. You call and they come an hour later. This is convenience at it's best. It's something the bigger companys try to offer already, but its fucking expensive at the moment. You have to have free trucks and divers somewhere near at all times, to offer a service like that.

And yes, there are many companys that have their own trucks. Especially for shorter distances like between distribution centers and retailers. But for any other form of shipping, outsourcing trucking is already prevalent.

Long story short: my question here is, what are your thoughts about this and who might be a the winner? Is it companys like FedEx and Amazon, who have a huge fleet of trucks and can suddenly offer different kinds of deliverys, like freight forwarding ^is ^that ^a ^word^? ? Is it the company that builds trucks? The software? The tire manufacturer because trucking will grow exponentially? The satelite operator? Anyone else?","['FDX', 'AMZN']"

Companies that own trucks now will own self-driving trucks when they're out and have fewer employees so long as the economic tradeoffs (high PPE cost, lower labor) are right. Companies that hire truck delivery will continue to do so. There's only so much that needs to move at any given time, whether you have a driver or not, someone still has to pay for the idle resource. Maybe you'll see some efficiency gained by ""loaning"" out a percentage of your fleet when your requirements are low, but you'd have to hope that others aren't in the same situation.",
na82fc,gxsub8v,investing,comment,1620781793,"You people really need to research the market better if you don't think this will happen in the next 10 years. 

The first autonomous trucks drive from rally points between cities. Highway driving is the easiest for autonomous vehicles since there is very simple traffic rules and few unexpected obstacles. Once at the check point they will switch off to a manual driver if needing to drive in more complex environments. 

several trucks will have a single remote operater. If a truck is having a problem it will alert the remote operator to take control until the truck can resume driving again. 

Andrew Yang is one of the few politicians who is recognizing this and trying to help out before all the truck drivers are laid off.

As for which company to invest in it's kinda hard to tell because of how early it is and because there are so many different companies working on it.

The issue is more about security and supervision. Ultimately I think truck drivers will be more like ship’s captains. This analysis does make me wonder if we might see a swarm of trucks under one driver, so you might have a dozen locations in one city. Self driving trucks go to each, driver hits each to sign off on acceptance or delivery, but they don’t need to hang around. Possibly you could go driverless with the customer taking more risk/liability as a lower cost option.",

In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

&#x200B;

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

So I'm fairly new in this topic. I did some reading in the threads provided here but it didn't quite provide the answers I was looking for.

Currently I (27M) am working in a company that provides a ESPP, up to 15% of my salary monthly, purchased in 6 month installments (at a 15% discount). I can change my contribution once per year (every May) and cash out every 6 months (after the purchase has been completed). Currently I contribute 3% of my salary only, but want to bump it up to 10%. The ESPP is done via eTrade. This is where my questions begin: I would like to sell my stocks (as I don't want to be holding single stock) and invest in some ETFs or something more secure. I see Vanguard recommended a lot on here but since my plan is through eTrade I would prefer keeping it simple and using them- but how do I begin?

Any good resources to read up on this, to properly set up my account for this and any other tips to a beginner?

n94bfc,,investing,post,1620652939,"Some long-term strategies worth remembering in today's speculative and volatile marketsBefore we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

(collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

n93q2k,gxm155y,investing,comment,1620657100,"The general inflation playbook = buy stock in the producers of commodities and financial companies that can benefit from a steepening yield curve. Be short duration in general.

The inverse also tends to be true on what to sell. Sell off low growth yield, sell off companies that are going to be adversely affected by rising wage input prices or rising input prices for the base commodities. 

**So in other words, go long on:** Oil, metals miners, agricultural inputs, banks, insurance companies, companies with pricing power. Industrials (XLI) tend to be good at the start of reflation, but as inflation starts to bite into the economy, a lot of the industrials end up getting hit hard from high producer price inputs. Industrials tend to be sensitive to demand from emerging markets, so a lot depends on what is going on there.

**Sell:** Consumer staples, utilities, most fixed income, retailers, low profit technology (IE, favor stuff like semiconductors over software).",

n8nkcd,,investing,post,1620594296,"Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?",

i dont think getting lucky picking tech is the same as low risk. if your comparison relies on hindsight analysis its probably pretty ineffective

real estate allows for pretty significant growth. keep in mind that you use a significant amount of leverage when buying real estate, if you put down 20% on a 1m property and it grows 10% in a year youve gained a lot more than 10% relative to your actual investment",

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

n8hkut,,investing,post,1620577266,"Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

A real risk parity portfolio should use futures (as All Weather and AQR do) for the lowest financing rates to efficiently achieve a high enough allocation of low vol assets. Many retail investors do not have a broker that supports futures or enough capital to practically use treasury rate futures, so some use leveraged ETFs or options instead. Many risk-parity-flavored model portfolios like All Seasons and Hedgefundie's do not bother to actually calculate a risk parity allocation, or update it over time, and instead use a simple static allocation that is close enough. There's nothing magical about doing an exact rp allocation though. It's just another method of generating diversified portfolios without full knowledge of future asset performance.",
n8fpef,,investing,post,1620571698,"Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",['GOOGL']

Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

So the whole idea of CET1 is that it's capital the bank's investors stand to lose.  That's usually equity, but also any earnings they're entitled to which is why retained earnings and AOCI get lumped in there.  In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize.

After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.",['CB']
n8pzgh,,investing,post,1620601476,"The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow RapidlyI may do a much longer and well-sourced post on this when I have more time, but here's a rundown of why the small arms industry, in my opinion, is an excellent long term investment, not even looking at how the Biden administration will play into the cyclical nature of gun stocks.



**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",['AAPL']

Not to mention the constant deadlock on gun control, I assume as a US person, all other countries are becoming more and more strict on gun control, making guns harder to obtain and more socially unacceptable.

War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growth, not the civilian market.

Just because the pandemic and political situation helped the gun industry (jury's still out on that) doesn't mean it's a safe long term investment.

Guns are on a long-term growth trend, but to a large degree, guns sales the past several months have been driven by a) yearly seasonal effects (hunting season + people blowing their tax returns), b) a Presidential election year, which always sees higher gun sales and c) the pandemic and ensuing recession caused a buying spree.

Right now all three of those effects are going away, so I expect gun sales to decelerate rapidly over the next few months.   I've finally found some guns I've been looking for in stock again after months of them being sold out, which suggests my thesis is correct.

Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

I think it's questionable that fund managers should be out there predicting their returns for the next 5 years. I can't recall another retail fund manager that has ever been in the press predicting literal % returns for the next 5 years (or 1 year for that matter.) A manager might say ""I expect a good year for tech"" if they're a tech fund or that sort of thing but I can't recall another mutual fund or ETF manager saying ""I predict X% annualized for my fund for the next 5 years."" I thought it was iffy when she did it earlier this year and now she's doing it again. So to me it's not even the math of the projections but the fact that she continues to do it in the first place.

She's really ""hyper growth all the time"" - the issue becomes it's not going always be in favor (and I think people took last year's unbelievable/once in a great while performance as confirmation/validation of hyper growth rather than possibly a ""grand finale"" - at least for a while - to cap off a decade where growth was largely the ""only game in town""), but she invests as if that's the case. Look at recently with her selling large liquid names into declines so she can buy even more of smaller, less liquid things a lot of which she already owns 10% or more of. What if she sells all the large liquid names and the decline keeps going? I wish Ark could be more dynamic in its approach - it feels like everything has to be hyper growth all the time or it's not ""on brand.""

""But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline.""

She's said that there will be declines/corrections, but she doesn't invest as if that's the case and those statements are offset by her very bullish long-term predictions. ""There might be some big declines, but listen to how well this is going to do!"" I said early this year on here that the performance was not sustainable as the discussion became more and more Ark-y on here.

 Additionally, how much of the money that has poured into Ark came late? The inflows really didn't start en masse last year until in the second half of the year when the funds were already up 100% YTD. Tons of new investors started earlier this year and I'm sure a lot of them went right to Ark, chasing last year's performance.

Employed $3500 USD p/m

Objectives: Long term growth and investment / retirement

Time horizon 10-15 yrs

Risk tolerance: moderate

Holdings $6000 USD, no debt, $3000 USD liquidity

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.",['SPGI']

n7802u,,investing,post,1620418954,"Competition is Growing in the Telehealth SectorThe pandemic has changed a lot of things for good, including healthcare. Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion a few days ago:

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

\*I    am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to   ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results   and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t    understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and    henceforth. You are welcome to do whatever you like with the    information, though if you’re going to sell it that’s some pretty messed    up \*\*\*\*. Past results are no guarantee of future returns.","['CPRT', 'AAPL', 'REGN', 'SPGI', 'IBM', 'MSFT', 'DG', 'MPWR', 'ACN', 'ETSY', 'VRTX', 'AMAT', 'ABMD', 'PAYC', 'TER', 'CHD', 'LKQ', 'ATVI', 'PHM', 'ALGN', 'ODFL', 'TROW', 'FB', 'ISRG', 'ANET', 'KLAC', 'FTNT', 'MNST', 'TYL', 'NVDA', 'INTC', 'EXPD', 'GRMN', 'MKTX', 'CDNS', 'TSLA', 'APH', 'TDY', 'ADBE', 'EW', 'LRCX', 'INTU', 'IP', 'PAYX']"

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'NFLX']"

n70yxb,gxagphz,investing,comment,1620405088,"No. They will never be profitable.  The entire industry is currently subsidized by venture capital funding.  That is to say, investors in the delivery service paid $10 of your $60 food order.

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",

Not only will this eliminate wages paid to the drivers but it will eliminate tips and will reduce the delivery expense for customers.   Currently they are testing delivery robots in certain cities but these are only really feasible in dense urban areas where the delivery distance is relatively short.  Solutions for longer distances have been in the prototype phase for years which include aerial drones for at least some portion of the total distance but this will take much longer to come to market as it is dependent on FAA laws and regulations which are still being developed.,
n6dh3d,,investing,post,1620324294,"I sold every share I own today.I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner. Rant over.","['TSLA', 'SPGI', 'TWTR']"

n75u6r,,investing,post,1620413353,"Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls ShockGold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.","['PM', 'ED']"

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

I think this could be an interesting play but a lot of murkiness here and even now sales growth is not that impressive for the multiples it is trading at.  I think the problem with stock with high valuation is that when expectations are not met and results are off even a little they will have a mean drop. it will be interesting to see how this one shakes out.,

Below is a list that we used to give out to interns and analysts in the S&T program at a BB. The books are split into 3 categories (Markets, History and Other). Each of the categories starts with the basic must-reads and leads to more complicated topics. The idea was that you should read the first couple in each category as an intern/analyst and then keep reading as you develop in your career eventually completing the list as a \~VP level on the trading floor.

Hope you enjoy - Feedback appreciated!

n6l995,,investing,post,1620344980,"The Roaring 2020s (Economy/Stocks)So.

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Conclusion. Get in losers, were doing the roaring 2020s. And they are mad that the poors have a better chance of capturing income in this decade.",

n6fysa,,investing,post,1620330775,"In just 3 months, Tesla has issued 80% of the shares ARK's valuation model projected they would issue through 2025.Their model is beyond amateurish.  Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

n6klu0,,investing,post,1620343064,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

Finally, even if stocks were exactly the unavoidable minefield described in this article, it's not a mathematically persuasive argument against active investing. After all, an active strategy could also include direct indexing where an investor owns merely *most* of an index. If owning just a few stocks is bad, then owning all but a few has to be the mirror image, right? You're effectively indexing + shorting a bad active strategy.",

Cloudflare earnings and revenue for the March quarter topped analyst estimates while revenue guidance came in above Wall Street targets. Cloudflare stock rose in extended trading, clawing back from a big loss in Thursday's regular session as software growth stocks retreated.

San Francisco-based Cloudflare (NET) reported a first-quarter loss of 3 cents per adjusted share vs. a 4-cent loss in the year-earlier period. Revenue jumped 51% to $138.1 million, said the provider of cloud-based networking and cybersecurity services.

Analysts expected Cloudflare to report a loss of 3 cents per share. Estimates called for revenue of $131 million for the period ended March 31.

Cloudflare stock rose 6.2% to 73.37 in extended trading on the stock market today. In Thursday's regular session, Cloudflare stock plunged 12.6%.

n6rgw5,,investing,post,1620366351,"Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500Hi,

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","['TSLA', 'SPGI', 'MSFT', 'ADBE', 'NFLX', 'NVDA', 'AMZN']"

It's 150%, actually.

>Through which business segment?

Ads. Their ad revenue growth was 77% YoY for the last quarter and it doesn't really have costs.

>Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.

I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.

* Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously [cash-heavy](https://merchantmachine.co.uk/most-reliant-on-cash/) countries.
* After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.

> AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.

* There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.
* Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.
* The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend)).

Taking the points above into account, we probably won't see a massive decline in AWS growth for a while.","['GOOGL', 'AMZN']"

I need to look into the growth further.  However, it's concerning to me because they just reached profitability in 2020.  A quick look shows revenue growth could decline from 14% to 10% in the next 2 years.  That's down from 40% just a few years ago.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

Tech earnings are receiving all the hype recently, and if you guys are like me, you’re looking for stocks to get into at low prices, and ride out the growth (we’re all aiming for the next TSLA). While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.","['MMM', 'TSLA']"

If he believed in Berkshire's future once he and Charlie are no longer at the helm, wouldn't it make more sense to leave her the money within Berkshire?

Based on this, does it make sense to invest in Berkshire for the long term based on his comments versus an index fund?

Edit: fixed some grammar and framing to be more clear",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['SPGI', 'KO', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

TL;DR Warren & Munger ""Our wives are filthy casuals""","['SPGI', 'WFC', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx62vky,investing,comment,1620319497,"I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN']"

The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
>  
>**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**

>  
>“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”

He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
>  
>**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families.

\- Maybe a comparable to analyze its growth against another company either in the same or adjacent segment.

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

ncrnn0,,StockMarket,post,1621056831,"Is technical analysis science or pseudoscience? I wanted to find out. Sourced.TL;DR - It looks like technical analysis doesn’t stand up to scientific scrutiny in any study I could find which took steps to filter out the effects of self fulfilling prophecy. I, personally, am choosing not to engage in it any further.

I was starting to learn technical analysis. However, I wasn’t getting any good results when backtesting (after I caught myself and took steps to stop myself from exerting my own confirmation bias on my tests). So I decided to try to dig into the science behind it to see if spending any further time studying it would be worth it.

I’m being careful here not to cherry pick data. The reason I’m focusing on the articles I’ve linked is because they are the ones that bothered to take into account and take steps to eliminate results skewed by self fulfilling prophecies and confirmation bias. Aside from the last one which I included because it was the most comprehensive one I could find.

I wanted to know if technical analysis actually works. I didn’t want anecdotal evidence. I wanted scientific evidence.

This is what I found.

This first bit of research is by far the easiest to understand as it isn’t written in scientific jargon. It’s not quite as scientific as the others and was done by one person who had the same questions I did.

https://towardsdatascience.com/does-technical-analysis-work-heres-proof-a2b626a3fbe9

They tested MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator.

They found that for all asset classes, with the exception of one, technical analysis had zero alpha. (No gains)

They were tested standalone and in combination with other indicators.

The only exception they found was Bitcoin, but they also threw in the side note that Bitcoin is primarily a retail driven asset and as retail investors believe in technical analysis it’s more likely that the combined buys and sells due to the belief in the indicators were causing the indicators to work and not the other way around.

However they did point out that, seemingly ironically, reversing filtered indicators had some slight positive alpha for non Bitcoin asset types.

They did mention they would have to test a much larger sample set to see if the Bitcoin alpha or the indicator reversal alpha with other asset classes would hold up.

But the correlation for other asset classes was so slight they acknowledged it wouldn’t be profitable.

Let’s look at another study. Now we’re getting really scientific and busting out mathematical equations with symbols that most of us can’t even read.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017736799

They tested out some popular candlestick patterns on a market in Thailand over a 100 year period (they picked Thailand emerging markets to avoid the issue of data snooping). They tested the candlesticks along with Stochastics, RSI and MFI. They tested a number of different holding periods as well. 

They found that the candlestick patterns were not statistically significant and would not result in positive returns even when combined with other indicators.

Let’s look at yet another study. This one contains a bit of a case study but they do their own work to draw their own conclusions.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967202/

This one is the only one that focused at all on resistance. They basically determine that the probability of bouncing correlates with the growth of the investors trust on following bounces. Essentially, it is a self fulfilling prophecy and the resistance lines only form because of the investors growing trust in the probability of a bounce.

The following is this real gem here.

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis-Macedo-8/publication/349608864_An_Inquiry_into_the_Validity_of_Technical_Analysis_in_Financial_Markets_With_the_Use_of_Evolutionary_Techniques/links/60382c624585158939cdaeec/An-Inquiry-into-the-Validity-of-Technical-Analysis-in-Financial-Markets-With-the-Use-of-Evolutionary-Techniques.pdf

It’s really long. It’s really comprehensive. Though the authors do note their own results are inconclusive and this is more of a discussion starter. They did find a few actual positive correlations between certain samples, however they also did note that they were only reproducible during certain time spans.

I will wager my own best guess that the historical time spans where they did work were most likely the time spans where those methods were most frequently being used in those markets and could potentially be explained away as self fulfilling prophecies since as far as I could tell this is the one study I listed where they didn’t necessarily use criteria that would exclude that bias from the results.

What will I gain from the hours of reading I just did on these topics? I will conclude that technical analysis is not something which I will personally put any more time into learning. I think any of the proven correlations which I could find were not significant enough to result in gains, especially after taking slippage and brokerage fees into account. Furthermore, the methods which did have a positive correlation only seemed to be effective during certain historical times or in domains ruled by retail traders due to the self fulfilling prophecy.

In addition, quite a bit of information in some of these studies showed that all of those indicators were outperformed by simple buy and hold strategies.

I’m sure that more than a few people will disagree with me here. But these are my own conclusions. Take from it what you will.",

ncrnn0,gy732qb,StockMarket,comment,1621068695,"Interesting read. Have you looked into studies self fullfilling prophecies in the market? I always thought that that was how you time a position and that indicators only work if people use them, that indicators can be a driver or a proxy. Also my rationale is that this makes sense in an attempt to synchronizing buying power across many investors which otherwise have little to go for in terms of communicating.

Has anyone instead used technical analysis on indices to time placements of an asset, to ride om its beta?

I guess also time on market beats timing the market.",

To solve this problem, even areas as well-studied as Biology rely on statistics to define the significance of their hypotheses.

You can allegedly collect data about the technical behaviour of stocks and see if one pattern or another emerges as statistically significant. 

Will it make TA scientific? probably not. But at least you'd have some evidence to the likelihood of any given pattern to predict future behaviour.",

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
> # Fed Ahead
> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
> # Retail earnings and housing
> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
> “The S&P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
> “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

> # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

> # ""Inflation"" Trends

> You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

> On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

For this reason I wanted to dissect their investments a bit and see if I would invest in these companies myself. I'm uncomfortable putting half of my BIO investment into a black box.

nd221f,,StockMarket,post,1621094368,"Ed Lins' Baron article on the Tennessee Department of TreasuryIn today's issue of Barrons, Mr. Lin puts the country on notice that State Pension Funds ( one that you would think has somewhat of a fiduciary duty to the fund-since it involves State employee's retirement monies) has bought Tesla and GM stock and sold G E stock as well as Walmart stock!

At first blush, after reading the headline only, you would say ""they must have done quite good with those trades""! However, after piecing together the actual figures that Mr. Lin posts, it was more of a disaster than a combination of winning trades.

The department purchased an additional 67,648 worth of Tesla shares - on top of the 293,695 shares of Tesla they currently owned - this happened at the end of the first quarter. The total dollar value of those shares of Tesla, selling at 719.00 per was $259,805,617.  The closing price, after what this reader considers to be a ""dead cat bounce"" was $589.74 : a total dollars value of $213,098,421! The total loss on their books from Tesla shares bought at the end of the first quarter, as well as those 293,695 valued at that time, was a staggering 46 million and 77 thousand dollars. The Treasury Departments' of Tennessee employees took a hit.

You can do the math on the other 3 companies mentioned on your own; pretty much peanuts compared to the loss on the 'Tesla Bet""!

What I'm trying to point out, to new traders especially, is to read the entire article; not just the 'Headline'!

Otherwise, you'll continue to 'fall for the sizzle'. rather than the steak!

Then the day came, Unity dropped from 150$ to 125$, put a a lot of money into it thinking I’m gonna be seeing only green for the rest of the year, but oh boy was I wrong. 

1 week later, it’s at 100$. I’m thinking okay, just gotta wait until the next quarterly report in may and it should recover to 125$. 

1 week before quarterly report, Unity drops to 82$, me still believing in it, I put a little bit more money at 82$. 

Next day, drops to 76$, by here I promised myself to never put money into unity again. 

Finally quarterly report comes out in may, it’s great, unity shoots up to 89$. Then next day of the market goes back down to 81$. So I’m just gonna leave it there, hopefully by 2023, it’s back to 150$.

On the bright side , it’s better to make mistakes in your first year of stock investment than in your last. Also note, unity is not my only position, but it’s my biggest one.",

Let's take a closer look at XP Power.

Thread 🧵 ⬇️

**1) What does XP Power do?**

The company manufactures power converters for industrial electronics and medical equipment.

**2)  Why is this so important?**

The converters in machines that make semiconductors or monitor patients in hospitals on the other hand are critical. Failure could halt a production line, or an operation.

**3)  Why is this so profitable?**

Once an equipment manufacturer has chosen to use an XP Power converter, it should remain a customer for the machine’s lifetime.

**4)  Does the business make good money?**

Hell yeah

＋High returns on capital and sales

\+Decent cash conversion

**5)  Threats?**

The main threat is low-cost competition from Asia, which is eating away at XP Power’s soft underbelly..

**6)  Solution?**

Moving to high voltage & Green.  As XP Power moves up the value chain, it is sloughing off parts of the business. It closed its low voltage design center in the UK.   It also moved recently acquired high voltage manufacturing from Nevada USA to Vietnam.

**7)  Green you say?**

Now the company is focusing manufacturing resources on more complex and profitable high-power converters and high-efficiency “Green Power” products.  XP Green Power converters are 95% efficient, producing five times less waste energy than competitor suppliers

**8)  Are the directors acting in the shareholders best interest?**

Yes,

\+ Founder and chairman owns 6% of the company

\+ Directors are experienced and committed shareholders

\+ They are also very well paid, but perhaps not extravagantly so

**Recent Results?**

Revenue increased 17%,

Adjusted profit rose 26%,

The outlook is good. Revenue was well ahead of the prior year and a strong order book even though demand from healthcare equipment manufacturers has subsided.

It's a solid company all around.

ncii5n,,StockMarket,post,1621024996,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend. 

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

The problem is it creates motivation to manipulate the price of the security.

If you have a short position and the price goes up if you’re a whale with institutional access you can do things to temporarily lower the price like create a bunch of micro transactions where the shares are sold and bought at a lower price. Or pay CNBC to destroy the stock with fake news.

If you’re retail you could just go on twitter and say bad things about the stock.

ncj7ax,,StockMarket,post,1621026872,"The road aheadThis week, after seeing my portfolio tank 40% (on margin) on Monday, I sold everything. 

I held these stocks through the storm of red and green, through the gain and through the pain. Monday I did it. I sold. I couldn’t stand the red. It was eating my up inside; at school, all I could think about how much my portfolio was failing. I couldn’t focus. Couldn’t sleep. It overwhelmed me. Took ahold of me. 

Worse mistake of my life. Growth sector has been getting beat down, and seeing almost the entire sector break the three month resistance levels made my gut wrench. I watched my carefully planned investments tumble to the ground.  I had failed. Everything I have accomplished was snatched from existence. It took ahold of me; it ruined me.  

Watching all of my stocks recover 15%+ the following days did more then ruin me. It destroyed everything I had worked for, everything I had fought for, everything I had lived for. It took my hopelessness and turned it into despair.  I yielded. 

I hit rock bottom a month ago and I just kept  tumbling. There is no end. Green Day’s became red days and red days stayed red. I bought high, sold low because when there is no bottom, time moves slow. After all, when there is no bottom, there’s only one way to go.

It was a gut wrenching week in the market but with all major market indexes ending the week all more or less up +1% this was the ideal way to end the week for me. All week it was freeing up cash, depositing funds, and averaging through red. Today however I woke up, saw green on market open, saw the green continue, and I took a deep breath and sigh of relief. I didn’t touch one stock or security today. After a week of what felt like absolute damage control, I was finally able to put my phone down today and enjoy the day confident knowing I worked hard investing in my portfolio in the time leading up to today. One of my grad school buddies called me up around lunchtime asked me if I wanted to go for some wings. I went and got a nice batch of wings and we ate amongst blue skies surrounded by lush green leaves. We even went to a bookstore and to a park. It was a great feeling just letting my portfolio be for the day and letting the worries and problems of next week stay on the back burner for the time being as I enjoy today. This goes out to everyone else who survived the week. Who bought the dips they felt they needed to. Who hedged where they felt they needed. Who freed up the cash they felt they needed. We all had a crazy week it’s truly fitting we have a day of green to decompresss. Cheers. You all deserve this.

nc8fw9,,StockMarket,post,1620998392,"Why are red days redder for Redditors? An analytical perspective!We have all seen it. SPY drops 2% and then there is a barrage of posts and comments about how it’s due to manipulation/next recession/long-overdue correction etc. I wanted to understand what causes such extreme reactions over small drops in SPY. There might be multiple reasons as mentioned in other posts such as inexperienced investors/lesser time in the market/volatile portfolio. While the first two cannot be proven analytically, we can definitely verify the volatile portfolio concept.

For this, first, we have to understand Beta. Put simply, Beta is the measure of the volatility of a stock in relation to the overall market. If we consider SPY as the benchmark, Beta of SPY would be 1. A high-risk tech company with a Beta of 1.75 would be more volatile than the market. I.e., if SPY returns 10% in one week, the company is expected to return 17.5% (75% more than SPY). But, this works both ways. If SPY drops 10%, the stock will drop 17.5%. Herein lies the problem.

Here is the list of most discussed stocks last month, along with their Beta values.

https://preview.redd.it/fuicageu63z61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=6487e65e9c213b9a98a533bce2610757a716aa08

As you can see, almost all of the popular stocks in social media have extreme volatility. For e.g., PLTR has a Beta of 9.6! This means that the stock will drop a whopping 9.6% for every 1% drop in the market.

For analysis purposes, I am creating an equally distributed portfolio of these 9 stocks (Coinbase is not considered as it has not been trading long enough to calculate Beta). The average Beta of this portfolio is 3.14! This implies that if SPY drops a mere 3% your portfolio would be down 9.3%. This value would be even higher in case you have a portfolio that is skewed towards CLOV or PLTR. What’s ironic here is that GME with its negative Beta can act as a hedge against red days!

**Limitations of the analysis:** One of the major assumptions with the analysis is that people who talk about stocks probably own that stock which might not be the case. Also, this analysis might not hold for future patterns since Beta accounts only for historical data and cannot predict where the market will go. Finally, the data is taken from nasdaq.com (as of 2nd May) and they haven’t exactly disclosed the time period or the benchmark they use for Beta calculation.

**Conclusion:**

As we can prove from the analysis, we significantly underestimate the overall risk we are taking by adding popular stocks to our portfolio. The phenomenal gains we see on good days can easily be taken away on red days which explains the overreaction. In other words,

*“what Beta giveth, Beta taketh away!”*",['NDAQ']

Thankfully, JL Collins, Choose FI, and Bigger Pockets had me looking at index funds for a few years before I got on Reddit.  My Roth IRA was made up of 100% VTSAX, and has a little over $16k.  Not a bad start for being 25.  Expecting an 8% compounding return, this balance should double every 9 years (rule of 72), so with no additions, I'm expecting this sum to be over $500k by the time I'm 70.  

I will continue to max my Roth every year, because I believe tax rates will be higher by the time I retire.  My future contributions will likely go straight to VTSAX.

Nevertheless, I sold off about $2,500 of my VTSAX (roughly 15%), thinking the crash was right around the corner.  This money has missed out on a 10% return since then, so I decided to get it back in the market.  I didn't want to put it straight back in VTSAX, just because I feel dumb that I will have to buy in at higher prices (lol).  

My thesis is as follows:

3. There is potential that tobacco companies *could* end up running the weed space. \~$500 in

1) I diversified between 3 stocks:  $560 in Sony, $330 in TTWO, and $140 in EA.  

2) No idea who will win in the weed space, and several of these companies could go bankrupt.  I consider this to be my riskiest play:  $200 in CGC, $200 in HEXO, $200 in OGI, $200 in TLRY.  Fortunately, weed stocks have fallen out of favor in recent months, so I'm not purchasing at all time highs.  These picks also have potential to benefit from a "".com"" effect, where weed stocks run up just because they are weed stocks.  

3) In case tobacco ends up dominating the weed space, I bought $300 of Philip Morris (PM), $120 of British American Tobacco (BTI), and $100 of Altria (MO).  The 5 year charts for these bad boys look abysmal, so this is just a smaller hedge.  Two of them pay a fat 6.8% dividend, so I guess it's not all bad.

This is pretty out of the ordinary for my investing style, so I would appreciate some feedback!  It's far from a DD, because admittedly, I haven't read the 10K for any of these companies recently.","['PM', 'EA', 'MO', 'TTWO']"

* PTON has sold off because of the recent recall on all of the treadmill products
* There are only 125k Tread+ and a little over 1k Treads
* PTON claims they will be able to deliver Treads as early as July
* PTON has more than 2m subscribers meaning Tread and Tread+ users only make up \~6.4% of connected fitness users
* Delivery times are back down to pre-pandemic levels (this was the initial cause for concern) 
* Revenue projections remain strong for this year and the recent quarter had better than expected profitability. The latter part is becoming increasingly important with today's market trends. 
* PTON trades at \~8x sales for a company growing at 140% with a subscription revenue model and strong gross margins. This seems very justifiable. 
* If the average recall costs PTON $6k, and everyone recalled. That would translate to a loss of \~650m. The stock is down around $10B in value! 
* Revenue for 2021, even with this impairment is expected to be 3x what it was in 2019 and they aren’t seeing a decrease in demand 
* The company is only projecting a <200M hit to their business even once this fiasco is solved. 
* Lastly, the business is experiencing record low churn numbers!

PTON is an ecosystem. Every bike or tread is a trojan horse into your household so you start paying the subscription revenue. PTON has done nothing but grows at higher than 100% for the past 6 years. This is not a pandemic story. This company was vastly successful prior and will be successful after, society puts the pandemic behind them. The recent recall is tragic, but the biggest risk isn’t a loss of revenue or earnings, rather it is consumer sentiment. Foley (CEO) came out and said the way PTON originally acted was a mistake, and he apologized for his initial comments. With that out of the way, and the recall being less of a drag than feared, this stock is now trading at a large discount. There is no loss in demand and the shipping problems are finally back to where they were in 2019!

I've been thinking about investing for a long while and have been really nervous about it until recently. I've been investing 500 ish in robinhood (Since I downloaded that before everything happened), and only recently been investing my money. So far I have 1.04 shares of ORCL, 2.51 shares of RIOT, 0.152 shares of AMC, and I just placed an order for VOO ETF. Am I on the right track?

I picked ORCL since at the time it was cheap enough for me to buy and that company had a good track record. RIOT seemingly has been giving me great returns already and I plan to sell it once I get a dollar or two in profit, and I have been wanting to mitigate my risks for the long term and have heard that ETF's are very good for that, so I got VOO. So now with nearly 520 invested, I plan on investing another roughly 500 to get 1k invested and just leave it at that as I'm a newbie. Thanks for the help and advice. I've watched a few videos already but so far all I've heard is ""Buy companies like visa, etfs, and just wait""? If it's not obvious, I just want something that's very low risk/low reward in a way.

Mkt caps in brackets.

* COIN sunk from its ATH of 342 to 265 (\~50B) after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from its ATH of $215 in late Feb to $113 ($35B+) after reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today.
* BMBL halved from its $80 ATH to $40 (4.67B) after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from its ATH of 31.19 to 8.11 after earnings yday (5.02B).
* CPNG is down from its ATH of 50.45 to 32.04 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Bonus: SPAC merger Opendoor crashed from $35 in Feb to its all-time low of 14 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $180 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which, except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from 63.40 on Apr 28 to 46.02 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 77.58 to 55.45 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70.45 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

nbqhvb,,StockMarket,post,1620937516,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday’s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near-term. Just my two cents. 

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department Released its Weekly Unemployment Report
   * **Initial jobless claims:** 473,000 vs. 490,000 expected and 507,000 the previous week
   * **Continuing claims:** 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected and 3.7 million the previous week
* Cryptocurrencies fell across the board after Elon Musk reversed his stance and said Tesla (TSLA) would no longer be accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment due to concerns over the environmental impact BTC mining is causing. 
* AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc has raised about $428 million from a share sale, capitalizing on the retail-trading driven surge in its stock earlier this year.

What I'm most worried about is RIOT, and ORCL.. I probably won't have AMC for too too long plus it's only about two dollars worth. 

&#x200B;

My reasons for buying them are so: ORCL has a decent track record and I heard they'd be a decent enough investment. RIOT, I saw they were extremely low and figured I would pick them up while they had the lowest dip it looked like. AMC, well, honestly I just heard that from people, but wasn't too too sure so I only put in about two dollars. I'm probably going to just sell it once I get anything from it. VOO and SPY were seemingly a unanimous good investment, especially for ETFs, and V being visa, figured I'd get in a Blue-chip company in there. Thoughts? It's about 1.1k invested",['ORCL']

It has signed a $22.5M contract to provide 95,000 units of its products. $22.5 MILLION! THATS ALMOST 3X THE MARKET CAP OF THE ENTIRE COMPANY! 
It also finalized another $1.96M deal in Dec. for its safebus product. This company is in the $250B child care industry!

AWTEC has already submitted the attorney letter meaning it should go pink current any day now! That would put it on many more brokerages to purchase, driving up volume and price.

nc0zlo,,StockMarket,post,1620969300,"Vetting retirement investment strategyI've been thinking about how to invest in my retirement accounts and was hoping for some discussion about it. The basic strategy is to buy an average to below average risk dividend etf and to hold for a long period of time (10, 15, 20 yrs), reinvesting all of the dividends. The rationale is to have a reasonably stable investment, and take advantage of dollar cost averaging by reinvesting the dividends, and ultimately resulting in having more shares which magnifies any appreciation of the etf. Given the dividends are not taxed inside the retirement account, this results in more money reinvested.

The etfs I'm considering are:

spyd

sdy

sphd

schd

The etfs are basically high yield, low expense ratio, with not much consideration for annual appreciation, the goal being to amass as many shares as possible before retirement. Any thoughts on this strategy and the etf picks?",

1) How do you know what is a low risk/low reward investment? Like, for example, I do not want to invest in random crap like dogecoin that's just a meme and isn't anything serious or long term. I would rather be able to invest in something that is good for the long term 
2) how much money is enough to start investing? I have about 5k, but because I'm new to it all I just put in about $140 on robinhood (I know, that app isn't the best). is that enough? 
3) what's the best way to just get into investing intelligently? like I said, I do not want to gamble. and if I do, I want to gamble with as little risk as possible. All I know is that, for example, it could be wiser to invest in something like Microsoft compared to a company that's going under due to Microsoft being good all around, and the investment typically goes up over time with ""blue-chip"" companies right? 
4) how long should you wait to buy/sell/put more money into a stock? for example since I only put in $140 into a few stock, should I sell if I get a dollar or two in return, or hold it? I assume there'd be a certain percentage you'd want to sell/buy right?

I just moved into a TD account and honestly I don't think I would have continued if I had started with it and not robinhood.... honestly I don't care how you get in the damn game... or how much you bring to the table with you....

things I wish I had known last year:

Don't Jockey a damn dollar chasing a dime...( last year when I first started... I kept trying to pick a peak to sell a stock so I could pick it back up 20 minutes later for a few pennies cheaper....)

think in terms of 1 year minimums.... taxes rates suck profits if you sell too soon...(if you make $100 government will want $50 if you sell under a year... $30 if over... or some shit like that.)

keep some cash at the ready... I have missed a few great dips because I felt I had to have my last 10% in a stock and not on standby....

if your a newbie.... stop trying to hit a fucking home run..... just get on base.... 

You are going to pay to learn how to play.... it can be in time, or money....  that part is your call... 

the first 5 stocks you buy should be companies that you can tell anyone what the hell they sell...(and you should probably like their product...) if you can figure out what drives their business, and what will screw it up, even better.

Have a plan.... if it is not in the plan, pass on it.... FOMO will fuck you up, ignore it.

Reevaluate the plan...

Know your exits..... for me... anytime my stock ran up to at least double... id sell about half...(I picked up 3 Square (SQ) just under $64... sold 2 at $230, and I don't mind so much that the last went down.... its the houses money at this point...)

listen to shows that talk about stocks.... CNBC... stuff like that... none of it will make any since at all....at first... 

put in what you can... when you can...

Know your other EXIT... I have a set goal for my accounts before cashing out... until that point... it says in...my RH is not my retirement...if it was.. my plan and my EXIT would be way different.

1) In terms of low risk/low reward investments, definitely a diversified portfolio is important. Sprinkle in some blue chip stocks, index funds, and ETFs and play the whole market for on average 5-8% return a year. If you want to split your money 70/30 or 80/20 on those low risk investments and more risky growth investments then it can make trading a little more fun if you have the time to do research. If not just put in the money and add on any major dips in the market.

2) Either 500 or 5k is a great investment. Just getting into the market is important and as you can put in more money you can grow your account faster. The low risk investing style takes time though so whatever money you put in just make sure its not money you need at this time.

3) Invest in a diversified portfolio of companies that cover all industries. Wait for stocks to pull back to their daily or weekly moving averages and starting averaging in to positions. Add on the way down as they dip and then hold. Right now or in the next few weeks is a great time to add blue chip stocks once we find a relative bottom.

4) If you are a long term low risk investor find a diversified portfolio and hold for a few months if not longer. You want to add on dips and then profit later. This type of investing takes time. If you are more interested in safer shorter term plays, option spreads are a great way to make money.",

nbhdvw,,StockMarket,post,1620914645,"Elon is not wrong about $BTC.He really isn’t. Objectively speaking.

$BTC is incredibly flawed, no matter how influential and defining it’s been for the entire crypto-revolution.

$BTC maxis are claiming the false statistic of ”75% $BTC miners use renewable energy”. While the correct statement is ”75% of $BTC miners use SOME renewable energy”. In reality, most of the energy is from non-renewables and by far the most used and relied upon form of energy is coal (the most harmful one).

Claiming that $BTC incentivizes the use of green energy is equally as good of an argument as saying ”Poverty is great because it incentivizes humanitarian aid”.

Also, bringing into the argument how much the traditional banking system spends energy is irrelevant. They process billions of transactions daily/weekly, and constantly move trillions of $ in value. The offered services and utilities are also uncomparable.
If $BTC had the same volume and adoption as the traditional banking/financial system, the energy usage would be like the usage of the entirety of Europe x10000. It’s an hilariously utopian dream.

Decentralization, that’s another flaw. $BTC is absolutely not decentralized. Because of China. China essentially has complete control over half of the network, if they want to. This is because of most of the mining facilities are in China and if they wanted to, they could disrupt the most of the network by cutting power from the facilities. Now I don’t know about you, but this does not sound very ”decentralized” nor ”out of governmental control and intrusion” to me.

There’s no reason for $BTC to exist when there are almost infinitely better options available, like $NANO for example. The only people still shilling for $BTC are the ones who are financially tied to the project and are unable to objectivelly assess and evaluate crypto projects.

$BTC is like the Wright brothers’ plane, while e.g. $NANO (or any other comparable technologically superior project) is a F-35.",

ETH has gone up over $4k from a low of $100ish.. technically a 40x compared to bitcoin's 15x. A lot of people are betting on the rise of ETH and similar PoS coins. And, anecdotal - a lot of my friends are looking at staking their ETH and similar coins via pools. It's going to be huge, assuming there are no major hiccups in the process.

*Current situation*: everyone appears to be convinced that we will be plagued by crazy inflation in the near future

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/americans-fear-highest-inflation-in-nearly-a-decade.html

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/13/top-bank-of-england-economist-warns-of-1970s-style-price-inflation

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/upshot/inflation-is-here-what-now.html

*Idea*: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down.

You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I’m a moron or not.


*Question*: how do I bet on deflation? The idea I had was to take the short side of some of the inflation assets, but a short play is not sustainable for a retail investor on the long term due to daily fees. 

So, how do I play deflation?",

I have a little bit of money which I've saved for around a year which is roughly £250, not much but it's the best I can do. (I am from the UK). At this point, I have nothing to lose and I'm desperate to make whatever little I can. So I have a few questions:

&#x200B;

* Which app is highly recommended to buy and sell shares/stocks?
* Which one charges the lowest commission?
* Can I add say £100 to my wallet and invest that, without the constant need of adding funds?
* Would it be possible to say make back my £100 and just reinvest my profits?
* I understand managing risk and studying data to make an informative decision, but is it really as simple as tapping a ""Buy"" and ""Sell"" button to make profit?
* What would you recommend I research/study to make sure I mitigate the risks as much as possible (to an extent of course)

I understand there's a lot more to it, I don't plan on making £5,249,2581 if I could just get somewhere with some little money I'd be more than grateful. 

If theres anything else you could recommend to me, I'd be more than appreciative.

But why would they do that when the [Interest On Excess Reserves](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm) is positive at 0.10%?

If you invest in individual stocks, some may do incredibly well, handily beating an index, and some may tank completely. So you are missing out on some potential gains, but you are also missing out on some major losses!

If you are diversified in individual stocks with many quality companies, that can also smooth out your portfolio’s performance. But that’s exactly what an index fund attempts to do, only at a much larger scale since they typically hold hundreds or even thousands of companies.

I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action.

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**. 

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue. 

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of patients they treat will slowly score up as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug. 

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us to have an idea of how Orladeyo is doing in terms of gaining new patients, but it's not 100% accurate. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw97n7ga89z61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d353dc8fe919da2f4e10d6c5f68527c7cb7813b

If we sum up the numbers from the Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already, meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in the Q1, reasuring the exponential growth. This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in additional countries.

&#x200B;

*  **Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill** 

&#x200B;

Basically Biocryst has a drug called Orladeyo, which is the first Oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE). It is estimated that HAE affects 1 in 50,000 people. 

&#x200B;

Orladeyo was firstly approved in the **USA** December the 3rd, **2020. Q4**

Orladeyo received **Japan** NHI price listing approval April the 14th, **2021. Q2**

Orladeyo received **European** approval April the 30th, **2021 Q2**

Orladeyo received **UK** approval May the 12th, **2021 Q2**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the **#13 most expensive drug** in the USA market. The price shown below **$37,308** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for **3,075 patients.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/arh13tkub9z61.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cfb70508321842a2123cb2b4fc586343e28dc94

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to **485,000$**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach **500 patients.**

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to **$248,500**

Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a **$15MM milestone payment from Torii.**

BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales.

 

&#x200B;

* **Europe**

It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of **4,920 patients in Europe.**

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's **$248,500/year**. This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

**USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$**

**Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$**

**EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$**

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of **$2,628,170,000**. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating **$2,628,170,000** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of **$18,397,190,000** meaning an increase of **$104,46 in the stock price**. 

&#x200B;

CEO himself confirmed multiple times that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. As shown in the pic below, current cash runaway takes them into 2023.

* **Conclusion**

We are just about to witness how ***BCRX evolves*** from being a small-cap company to being a high-cap one. This will mainly happen due to the ***revenue generated by Orladeyo*** and the ***potential of BCX9930.***

Basically from now on each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX. Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP. 

Orladeyo undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a **cash-cow**. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the **most promising future** is **BCX9930**. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 which treats **8 different diseases** as of now, aimming for a potential **40B market size by 2025**. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article [BCRX - The Embarrassment of Riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/). 

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. In my opinion BCRX probably has the best safe/reward ratio in the bio-world and I do not plan to sell my shares yet.","['IR', 'BIO']"

nc8sj2,,wallstreetbets,post,1620999420,"CNBC's Jim Cramer Is So Full of Shit...Don't ask me why but I often watch Mad Money on CNBC. I also make note of where I got recommendations when I buy stocks, and I'm starting to realize how bad his recommendations often are and how dishonest he is about his bad calls. A few examples:

&#x200B;

1) Last night, someone called into to ask about Aeva and he said he couldn't recommend it. Oh really? Actually, HE DID recommend it just several weeks ago. I know because I bought it soon afterwards and it tanked. I understand things change and he's entitled to change his mind but how about at least saying something like, ""I know I recommended this one before, but I can't now because of inflation or whatever...""

2) XL Fleet. Same story as above. He recommended it, then he didn't and pretended like the earlier recommendation never happened.

3) Tech meltdown. In the runup to the 2020 election, Big Jim was pimping hard for Biden. Okay, fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion. But he kept repeatedly claiming that Biden would great for tech stocks, especially Apple, because he would improve relations with China. This call has been catastrophically wrong, at least so far but no acknowledgment of this whatsoever from him. As a so -called expert, shouldn't he have known that the policies Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple tech stocks? 

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know. I shouldn't be taking recommendations from Cramer and other so-called TV experts. That's on me...but I just wanted to add my thoughts here in case others take him seriously. And yes, I'm sure some of his recommendations also pan out well but I wish he would man up and admit when he makes bad calls.",['AAPL']

ncnprb,,wallstreetbets,post,1621041322,"Why concrete companies are going to be the next meme stocksAlright so I'm sure you've heard of Biden's proposed 2.3T American Jobs Plan, fixing and creating vital infrastructure for the US economy while at the same time employing thousands for work. Out of this Bill, there is around 621B allocated for transportation.


Here is a quote from the White House's website about allocation:



*""Repair American roads and bridges. One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways and major roads are in poor condition, as well as 45,000 bridges. Delays caused by traffic congestion alone cost over $160 billion per year, and motorists are forced to pay over $1,000 every year in wasted time and fuel. The President is proposing a total increase of $115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair. This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce congestion. His plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets, not only “fixing them first” but “fixing them right,” with safety, resilience, and all users in mind. It will fix the most economically significant large bridges in the country in need of reconstruction, and it will repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges, including bridges that provide critical connections to rural and tribal communities. The plan includes $20 billion to improve road safety for all users, including increases to existing safety programs and a new Safe Streets for All program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans and other improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians""*


This will be the largest infrastructure plan since FDR released the New Deal, nearly 100 years later. 173,000 miles of concrete, 45,000 bridges made of... You guess it, concrete. 

With 621B up for grabs thats going into a product that gets manufactured, bought, sold and which companies issue shares for this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to hop on the concrete and cement train.


Now, this still has to get passed through congress. Along side with the American Families Plan, this a MUCH easier sell for republicans. 1.8T for the American Families Plan, 2.3T for the American Jobs Plan to a whopping total of 4.1T in spending. The funny thing is, out of the 4.1T the least contentious part is the 621B for infrastructure. This is actually [what](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/what-to-watch-for-in-congressional-debate-on-biden-economic-plan) republicans **want.**


Free education for four years? Tough sell.

Direct support to families and children? We'll see

Senior care and wage hikes? Good luck.

Infrastructure to repair roads, bridges and infrastructure using American made products by hiring American workers? **SIGN US UP** 

Even if its less than 621B, say what gets agreed on is 450B, I guarantee you out of anything in the entire two plans, the infrastructure will go through.



How to play this:

Load up on concrete. Firms and funds have already been doing this quietly in the background. Look at $PAVE, the US Infrastructure Development ETF. Since Biden was elected, its been on an escalator ride up. I believe this escalator will turn into an elevator soon enough, especially when the Dems and the Republicans get an appetite for all the sweet sweet gray concrete and black asphalt.  


So you can either go the ETF route or hop into individual companies.


Some of the top US Concrete companies:

CRH Oldcastle

**CX** - My favorite

Lafarge

US Concrete


CX is what I'm currently holding, got in around $6.50. I personally think anything under $10 is a steal. I think these are all going to run hot in the next few weeks with chatter around the two bills. Their revenue last quarter beast estimates by over 1000%. You read that right. They are perfectly positioned to take in a big chunk of this government spending. Look what they focus on:



*""CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V., together with its subsidiaries, produces, markets, distributes, and sells cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, clinker, and other construction materials worldwide. The company also offers various complementary construction products, including asphalt products; concrete blocks; roof tiles; architectural products; concrete pipes for storm and sanitary sewers applications; and other precast products, such as rail products, concrete floors, box culverts, bridges, drainage basins, barriers, and parking curbs.""*


That is exactly what we are looking for from a company who will profit over this bill.

I currently have a mixture of shares and options in CX, every time there is a dip I buy more. Including this last week. I wouldnt be surprised if this stock runs up to $15 when the final approval sets. 

At the time I wrote this article, CX is trading at $8.34. I don't believe we will ever see another bill this large with the sole purpose of infrastructure. Like I said, Franklin Roosevelt had his Infrastructure Plan approved almost 100 years ago. Don't miss this train.",['DE']

Regulation SHO is a list of securities that failed to settle in the previous five trading days. This list does not specify the cause of the failed settlements.

As of 5/13/2021, UWMC is on the list for straight 12 days, since 4/28/2021.

ncczh8,gy4e372,wallstreetbets,comment,1621012637,"Also options contracts expiring next Friday represent nearly [half of the entire available float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naxmxw/from_ashes_to_the_moon_and_then_back_to_ashes_in/), and 90% of the volume of those contracts is unhedged, meaning this thing is a powder keg waiting to blow.

There are 83.72m shares in the float. That's small. In fact, something like 94% of the company is owned by the CEO, with those 83.72m representing the other 6%. Insiders own 12.85% of that float and institutions own 24.50%, which together is 37.35%. For those of you who never graduated from elementary school, that's 31.27m shares, which makes the free float 51.45 million shares.

Of that, 11.88m shares are short (as of 04/29) which is 23% of the free float. That's important, but not in and of itself enough to squeeze. (Addendum: It is certainly higher now than it was on 04/29, because as of TODAY there are zero shares available to short).

Options volume for 05/21 is huge - between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are approx. 205,500 calls, all out of the money. Their average delta is about 10% (according to Schwab), meaning that as they become ITM, 18.5m shares will be automatically bought by brokers to cover those calls. This is a gamma ramp - it will happen linearly if the stock ticks upwards, creating a positive feedback loop of rising price until they are entirely hedged. At the same time, shorts must cover if the price rises (or must they?). That means that IF the price rises significantly, nearly 30 million shares must be bought in the next 7 days to cover - that's **57% of all the shares available!**

Holy fuck.

Also on Wednesday the stock experienced an extremely sudden 10% surge (when everything else was in a multi-day freefall) and it hasn't gone back down.",
nce1jx,,wallstreetbets,post,1621013205,"Using data visualizations to identify suspicious behavior on WSBNote: You can find interactive versions of visualizations for tickers [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/nc9zqz/wsb_audience_graphs/) if you'd like to look deeper into the data, I just did a brief analysis here of the most obvious conclusions.

As some of you know I’ve been working with data on WallStreetBets discussion for well over a year now, and I wanted to share a visualization I made the combines a few different metrics. The goal was to visualize differences between the holders of different stocks and to try to identify instances of users attempting to manipulate discussion in a bad faith manner.

In order to do this, I went through ticker by ticker and looked at all accounts who had mentioned the ticker in the last 3 years. I then went through those accounts and looked at a few different metrics. The first thing I looked at was how many days it had been since they had first commented on WSB. I also looked at what proportion of their comments on WSB contained references to the ticker in question. Lastly, I calculated the sentiment of their comments mentioning the ticker.

A visualization of all of those metrics looks something like this:

[GME audience graph](https://preview.redd.it/s6rkc7yke4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a854d11b0dc90961d39fd191d1c957282861554)

This makes it quite easy to compare the holders of different stocks, for example we can compare the above visualization for GME with the visualization below for AMD. This provides the immediate and obvious conclusion that fewer newcomers to WSB have been discussing Lisa Su, as evidenced by the more rightward leaning distribution of points along the x-axis.

[AMD audience graph](https://preview.redd.it/spxfexoie4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf73292bc2d93feda0a4cfaef0acccb1074f949)

But it also allows you to identify attempts at manipulating discussion. For example, this large dark dot in the upper left of the GME graph looks rather sus. On a quick hover we can see that one user has been talking about GME an awful lot and doesn’t seem to have had very nice things to say.

[Sus](https://preview.redd.it/8gjv0itue4z61.png?width=1732&format=png&auto=webp&s=93f568296f1c6324c18d8f505b4465f142483721)

Looking at their profile, the math seems to check out.

[Their profile](https://preview.redd.it/fkgdsmure4z61.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e596d35c7b50be174f5f6ca67ea6b5b87d73597)

It’s worth noting that this post isn’t meant to insinuate that there's a ton of people out there exhibiting this type of behavior. On the contrary, accounts like the one shown above were quite rare and if there are people participating in the discussion threads in bad faith, it’s in a less blatantly spammy fashion.

So buckle up morons cause the Houston hammer is 7 drinks in and about to learn y’all something.

Some of you idiots may have already seen the numerous DD posts from [/u/Brotherluminous](https://www.reddit.com/u/Brotherluminous/) about some shitty boat company. No, I’m not talking about $CTRM, I’m talking about Canoo ($GOEV), the most shorted electric vehicle company around. But I’m not here to focus on the past, I’m here to talk about what could happen in the future, and I’ve got 3 bullet points for you fuckers.

· Short squeeze

· Gamma squeeze

· Earnings report

This baby is crowning and ready to pop at any moment. This is a risky fucking play and I’ve lost so much money the past few months my BAC hasn’t dropped below a .15 since the new year. I smoke so much hopium I make Whitney Houston look like the Texas hammer.

But let’s get to the juice

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Yeah, yeah, you’ve heard it before. Squeeze this, squoze that, or whatever the fuck. But “noT eVery sTock Is a ShOrt squEeZE”. You’re right, and nothing will compare to gaymestop, but that doesn’t mean a high SI won’t pump a stock if it starts climbing. And let me tell you shorts are jacked to their tits right now. I’m not good at words so here’s some things someone smarter than me said along with the most recent [Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/32ueS.png) data.

"" Total float is \~105mm, institutional ownership is \~6% of total shares (238mm) so about 15mm shares. This theoretically lowers the float to 90mm shares because most institutions will hold long term. So realistically we are looking at >30% of float is shorted. Also keep in mind that the numbers are estimates and this could very well be higher as utilization has also been 100% for a couple weeks now. "" - [/u/Strobe\_light10](https://www.reddit.com/u/Strobe_light10/)

Number this, number that, I'm to fucking stoopid to be able to tell you what all this number shit means. But this [website](https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze) has Canoo ranked #2 of companies ""that have the highest likelihood of experiencing a short squeeze"". Okay, that's pure speculation that GOEV claims the 2nd spot because I haven't paid to unlock the rest of the tickers, but GOEV was #1 15 days ago and I assume it's only dropped once by comparing market caps.

Days to cover is also \~10 days, meaning volume is so low it will take shorts around 10 days with average volume to close their position.

Margin requirements are high but shorts are still doubling down. This WAS a solid move, look at GOEVs chart, but shorts are smart and they’ll quickly abandon their positions once they realize Canoo is a legitimate EV company.

**GAMMA SQUEEZE**

I’m sure a lot of you idiots are familiar with this concept, but for those who aren’t, I’ll explain what’s going on here in a way that you apes can understand without boring you.

Someone has to write and sell you the FDs that you bought, typically market makers. Market makers will [delta-hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp) with shares to gain a [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) position. An option that is OTM won’t be hedged as much as an option that’s ITM. But as the option gets closer to being ITM, market makers need to buy shares to continue being delta-neutral. See where this is going?

As a stock increases, market makers need to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold, causing the price to rise more, causing higher strike call options to become ITM, causing market makers to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold, causing the price to rise more, so on and so forth.

This is especially volatile for low volume stocks, especially where the number of shares needed to hedge exceeds/is a significant amount of the daily traded volume.

$GOEVs average daily volume traded is 5.3m (although anecdotally I’d say the average for the past month or two has been roughly 2-3m, with days as low as \~1.5m, like today). Looking at $GOEVs low volume along with the [open interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp) (OI) for the 5/21 OTM call options is where things get insane. For those too lazy to read and don’t know, open interest is the number of options currently open.

​

&#x200B;

|5/21 Strike|Open Interest|
|:-|:-|
|10|16481|
|12.5|6787|
|15|20273|
|17.5|7515|
|20|8164|
|22.5|16273|
|25|7868|
|30|4430|
|35|7175|

​

Numbers were pulled today at 3:00 HOUSTON TIME

​

If you don’t know that each option represents 100 shares then you’re a literal moron and belong in this shitty sub. So those 16k 5/21 10c contracts are equivalent to 1.6m shares. When GOEV hits $10, market maker bitches will have to buy 1.6m shares to cover the call options. This is also assuming that market makers haven’t hedged the 10c, which why would they? The stock is shorted to shit and no one expects it to hit $10. And that’s only the 5/21 10c, look at the other strikes. My bet is if this shit hits $10 next week, the damn thing is soaring into the 20s, maybe the 30s.

**EARNINGS REPORT**

The one and only catalyst for this play; the earnings report happening on 5/17. Last earnings call went to shit and stock price tanked after Tony Tequila opened his big stupid fucking idiot dumb mouth. What this means though is that they’ll want to send some good news our way and save this shitty boat from sinking.

In all seriousness, I’m a fat Canoo bull long-term after listening to last earnings call, but investors panicked and shorts hopped on the red train. Tony mentioned releasing good news “soon” (manufacturing details among other things) and this could happen during this call.

**CONCLUSION**

This powder keg is ready to explode and all Canoo has to do is give us some good news on 5/17 to ignite the barrel. Quit FOMOing into shit after it’s already popped, and jump on the boat before it leaves the harbor. This is a short-term play with a long-term hodl potential, so calls if you're a ultra giga chad, shares if you're just a chad.

**Pros:**

\- Short interest is through the fucking roof

\- Open interest is higher than shit and has created a nice gamma ramp that we can walk to the moon on

\- Canoo is feeling a lot of pressure from investors to release some good news

\- GOEV is near its ATL, literally can't go any further down

**Cons:**

\- This earnings call could be negatively received like the last one

\- It'll be hard to decide whether to buy a lambo or yacht first

If you want actual long term hodl DD on Canoo, the crazy motherfuckers on the Canoo subreddit (who are wanting to stalk Tony Aquila's private jet) would be more than happy to tell you why GOEV is a solid investment. For now, all I care about is that this puppy is hitting $30 next week.

**Positions:** My entire portfolio is May/June 10c.

* **Bulls need to hold 415 - 412 - 410 (Below 410 and I'll be neutral - bearish)**
* **Bulls need push through 417.8 resistance.**
* **Bears need hold 417.8 or gap down to 415 test support and fill the 413-410 gap between vol trigger and gamma strike.**

# SPY RSI

Even though we are near oversold on the 1 day timeframe, we still have some room to run.

* Note the 91.5 top in beginning of April. Currently we are at about 70
* **We are still technically trending down on the RSI so we need to break the the 70 oversold line and hit 77 - 81 - 91 range for ATH.**
* **However, this could indicate some downside early next week before more upside, possibly later in the week. Keep an eye on it :)**

**Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon/UFOs \[and how to capitalize on them!!!\]**

Momentum has been building across the world for greater disclosure of government knowledge into UAP’s (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) after the New York Times released it’s bombshell coverage of encounters by 3 Navy pilots in 2017 and 2019 each reporting to have seen technology that defies the limits of physics with capabilities that far exceed that of any known assets in US, Russian or Chinese arsenals. Manoeuvres that have been witnessed include rapid deacceleration (high velocity to a sudden stop, then hover); sharp angle, high velocity low angle turns (right angles or sharper); low altitude trans medium travel (submerged craft lifting and flying from water, and the reverse); high altitude trans medium travel (craft dropping from above 80,000 ft then coming to a hover at 30,000 ft, and the reverse); high velocity travel (Mach 10+ or near instantaneous); non aerodynamic aircraft design (cubes, pyramids, cylinders, disks, acorns, top hats) and propulsion systems that do not function off of exothermic thrust based physics (no thermal heat trail). Pressure has been building on the Pentagon to release what it knows, which has since resulted in the declassification of those videos and confirmation by the Pentagon that they are authentic as well as new mandates outlined in the 2021 COVID relief bill mandating full government disclosure by June 2021. The Pentagon has also publicly announced the creation of a new UFO taskforce and has been giving closed door briefings to members of the Senate and Congress, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, on these incursions into American airspace. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has long fought for funding and disclosure and recently when asked the question “so are you saying there’s information that the public hasn’t seen on the subject”; he responded, “what I’m telling you is that the public hasn’t seen most of the information”.

As recently as two weeks ago, new videos and pictures have been leaked of UAP’s flying in formation over US battle squadrons which include captured images of acorn and pyramid shaped craft hovering at distance. The frequency of these incursions has also been alarming, prompting several Atlantic based Airforce bases to issue warnings to their pilots of unknown objects in their airspace ahead of every exercise. Radar technicians aboard the aircraft carrier “Nimitz” describe seeing these objects at such a high frequency and in such high numbers that on some days they were described as “falling out of the sky”. Additional alarm has been raised by other members of the military as the frequency of sightings also seems to correlate with proximity to nuclear facilities including missile silos, aircraft carriers and submarines, with senior officials in charge of these facilities describing anomalies in launch sequences that appear to be intentional. These concerns are what prompted Christopher Lemon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence along with Luis Elizondo, former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (ATTIP) at the Pentagon to leak the videos to the New York Times.

Speculation of UFO’s dates back to World War II where pilots regularly observed bright lights in the sky that would track them into battles. At the time, these unknown objects were referred to as “Foo Fighters” but were later termed UFO’s (Unidentified Flying Objects) after the public became enthralled in the crash at Roswell where the government announced it was in possession of an alien aircraft and subsequently retracted the story the following day. Public interest was further garnered in the 1980’s when a military contractor, Bob Lazar, who worked as a physicist on advanced propulsion systems came forward with information that he had worked on 9 crafts in government possession at a military black site called S-4 that matched the descriptions and performance capabilities of the UFO’s described by pilots. This base was later known as Area 51 and has captured the publics imagination ever since.

In 2001, a group of concerned senior military leadership and citizens held the first attempt at public disclosure, hosting the Citizens Disclosure Project in front of a panel of several sitting US Senators. While momentum again began to build, that momentum was quickly quashed by the events of September 11 and public interest and only just begun to resurface.

**Invest in otherworldly opportunities – Procure Space ETF (UFO)**

UFO has captured the minds of space-themed investing since its inception date April 10, 2019. It has performed remarkably in-line with peers when benchmarked against the S&P 1500 Industrials Index as of May 12, 2021. As with many funds of its vintage the crash of March’20 effectively served as a stress test to the financial health of its component companies, which it passed with flying colours, achieving almost a full retracement (the fund only recorded a loss in value of 3.64%, from $26.37 to $25.41, which was improved by a further 1% from dividends earned during the period). Post-2020, similar space-ETFs have launched in 2021 in advance of an anticipated flood of investor funds into this emerging sector as Morgan Stanley estimates the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion of more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. With roughly half of that increase expected to come from satellite broadband, UFO is well positioned to benefit from this influx of capital with 40.71% of fund allocation comprised of a mix of both orbital and surface communication companies.

**Why UFO? What’s the play here?**

Former Democratic Majority Leader and Nevada Senator Harry Reid, as well as other notable ufologists, have long claimed that defence contractor Lockheed Martin may have had fragments of a crashed UFO in its possession. Many claim that possession of the UFO material is what not only inspired the shapes of many skunkworks aircraft but led to multiple breakthroughs in materials research and stealth technology. Employees at Lockheed have gone so far as to make eyewitness reports of alien sightings and direct interactions. More broadly speaking, any admission by the government of extra-terrestrials will naturally be met with fear, and the simple play here is to place a long trade on defense and aerospace of which UFO has a significant composition (with an allocation of 27.19%, including major Pentagon contractors Raytheon, Northrop and Boeing). Should the evidence provided be less than conclusive interest in UFO the ETF is expected to increase at the bare minimum both from direct key term searches (literally the letters “UFO”), searches by retail investors surrounding related investment opportunities, and even more generally through social media sentiment. The uptick in interest should naturally lead to an increase in volume traded in popular aerospace and defense stocks, most of which are held by the fund. Defense stocks are a popular benefactor in times of global uncertainty and the sudden interest back to space is likely to exacerbate existing trends toward the militarization of space and a resurgence of Cold War between leading world powers (notably between the US, China and Russia, see this article in Politico below). Increased investment into satellite communications is also an expected knock-on effect as countries will be focused on boosting their “ears and eyes in the skies” (see below article from C4ISRNET).

There are 83.72m shares in the float. That's small. In fact, something like 94% of the company is owned by the CEO, with those 83.72m representing the other 6%. Insiders own 12.85% of that float and institutions own 24.50%, which together is 37.35%. For those of you who never graduated from elementary school, that's 31.27m shares, which makes the free float 51.45 million shares.

Of that, 11.88m shares are short (as of 04/29) which is 23% of the free float. That's important, but not in and of itself enough to squeeze. (Addendum: It is certainly higher now than it was on 04/29, because as of TODAY there are zero shares available to short).

Options volume for 05/21 is huge - between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are approx. 205,500 calls, all out of the money. Their average delta is about 10% (according to Schwab), meaning that as they become ITM, 18.5m shares will be automatically bought by brokers to cover those calls. This is a gamma ramp - it will happen linearly if the stock ticks upwards, creating a positive feedback loop of rising price until they are entirely hedged. At the same time, shorts must cover if the price rises (or must they?). That means that IF the price rises significantly, nearly 30 million shares must be bought in the next 7 days to cover - that's 57% of all the shares available!

Holy fuck.

There have been many posts recently about VIAC, and for good reason. The stock is chronically undervalued.

There have already been some posts that have gone very in depth about the fundamentals of VIAC that I read after I had a position in the stock, but are nonetheless very enlightening:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6byd0/viac\_is\_very\_undervalued\_in\_an\_overvalued\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6byd0/viac_is_very_undervalued_in_an_overvalued_market/)

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god\_tier\_dd\_viac/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/)

In fact, some of these reports are some of the first 'good' posts I have seen on WallStreetBets since the GME craze has dragged out months too long, but I digress.

**Summary**

If you don't know VIAC has already gone SuperNova, just not in the way you might like. Essentially due to some Wall Street shenanigans with margin trading in amounts that would make even the most brazen in the WSB crowd blush, the stock shot through the roof for some time. Some institutions/ hedge funds found about this, and decided to sell realizing that if VIAC ever crashed it would crash hard, and boy did it. Losing more than half its value in just a fews days, VIAC was essentially nuked to shreds. But, the company continues to grow and recent earning reports have been good, yet the stock has not been able to push past the $40 dollar mark. This is where my theory comes in.

**Why I Made This Post and A Simple Theory**

We could hypothesize all day about why VIAC isn't budging from its current price point. Perhaps institutions aren't willing to touch VIAC yet because the downfall left a bad taste in their mouth. The lamb's blood is on the door so to speak. Perhaps the valuation right now is fair and the wisdom of the masses is outsmarting me and you (if you read the DDs this does not seem to be the case but let's play devil's advocate for a minute). It could be a bevy of other things that are too technical for us retail traders to understand (even though I believe these complexities are hardly ever the reason markets move). But, I have a simpler theory: there are some whales who are offloading their shares around the $40 range, and once we pass this mark this thing is going to go gangbusters.

[I don't draw on charts very often so sorry if this is sloppy ](https://preview.redd.it/d19cx5w5j5z61.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06c565a7ac465a7e144cb54afb2b6faa7747654)

If you look at the charts VIAC just keeps bouncing around that $40 range, and that resistance is most likely caused by whales who didn't sell fast enough to cut their losses. These whales have hit this resistance multiple times, and the dam is weakening. There seems to be no viable explanation other than this as to why VIAC has not gained at least a marginal amount, it simply defies logic.

I made this post not to convince you that VIAC is undervalued or anything like that, if you can't see that you should stop trading now because this is as blatant as it gets. I made this post to tell you to get on board while you still can. The resistance is not going to last much longer.

Come make some money with me.

ncnic1,,wallstreetbets,post,1621040602,"Huya: The most undervalued company in the market.https://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these goddamn numbers:

Market Cap: $4b
Sales: $1.67b
P/S: 2.4
PE ratio: 28
PEG ratio: 0.3
2020 Revenue growth: 30%
2020 Earnings growth: 89%
5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%
Cash: $1.6b
Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b
Sales: $1.8b
P/S: 20.5
PE ratio: 0
PEG ratio: 0
2020 revenue growth: 50%
2020 earnings growth: -118%
5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%
Cash: $2b
Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya has been hit with the perfect storm of bullshit. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

Then Huya is screwed? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

What am I doing?

I’m buying LEAPs all the way down, averaging in from the start of this week. I’m up to 90 already and buying many more hopefully before it shoots up.

Even though nuclear power is the most effective form of power generation with the smallest negative footprint on the environment and ecosystem, everyone tries to keep it down and only call out one or two short comings.

Hydrogen fuel cells are:

1. Cleanest emissions out of all forms of fuel.

2. Greener than batteries as there is no need to dispose of them.

3. Can have a higher output than batteries.

4. With the proper infrastructure, you can fill up in 5-10 minutes rather than 30mins - 1hour for batteries.

5. We are nearing being able to effectively use solar and wind to power the process of electrolysis to separate hydrogen from oxygen, which would make the fuel for the cells 100% emissions free.

6. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. (Insert angry oil company lobbyist right here)

7. Solar powered homes could one day provide power to homes during the day, while at the same time provide the power for electrolysis to make its own hydrogen fuel for a generator to power the home during the night. Goodbye batteries that we can’t dispose of, and that have a limited amount of resources.


Hell, the military was looking into Chevy trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells to use in the dessert. One of the reasons; the soldiers could literally drink the emissions as it’s pure h2o.",

Pandemic is essentially over or will be over in the Western world with the poorer countries targeted next for vaccine rollout. There is a lot of pent up travel demand and summer is coming. Airlines are recovering and ordering more planes and predicting travel will fully rebound by 2025 or sooner.

Hey what company has been doubly fucked by pandemic and shitty plane design and is trading at a massive dip and historic discount and below fair value and price target, yes you guessed it $BA. The pandemic is reaching it's end and the max 8 has been certified to by FAA to fly again. BA is delivering planes again. $BA is poised for massive rebound.

Hell $BA even soared to $280 dollars a month ago on plane deliveries before the electrical wire issue tanked the stock again. With the electrical wiring resolved and max 8 deliveries resuming buying $BA at this level is a steal and if it recovers to former levels will be well above $400 in the future. Remember   Boeing is part of duopoly and travel is poised to be in the next sector rotation.

ncfyq9,,wallstreetbets,post,1621018229,"$DASH - Even your wife's boyfriend haters DashingDoordash is a food delivery company that IPO'd last December at a $37 BILLION market cap. After multiple valuation rounds, it opened at $102.00, from which it rallied up to north of $180 on opening day. With an ATH within recent months up to $250+, the stock became fatter than a swamp possum with the mumps, bleeding down until $110, new low since IPO. Today, it rallied to $140. Here's a quick rundown of DASH history, followed by why this garbage ass stock will drown faster than Bill Gates in a sea of pussy upon the closing out of his recent marital transactions. 

Dec 9 2020 - Doordash ($DASH), food delivery services company with larger market share than competitors (UBER, GRUB etc.) IPO's and opens on secondary market (us retards buying micro-cap growth stocks with revenue projections more bullishIT than me losing my virginity to Ariana Grande and paying for Robinhood's order flow while doing it) at $180 USD.

Jan 2021 - Stock hits new low of $140, well, cuz it's dogshit and wsb bought calls (not true). Meanwhile, your wife's boyfriend shorted it (true) and made enough money to plant hairs on Cramer's head.

February - New ATH after GME saga at ~$250. This is when Warren Buffet opened his secret position of $DASH puts. He told me.

Feb 25 - Dash reports earnings, biggest revenue in history due to COVID, but... $-2.75 EPS, misses estimates by like 300%. Begins to dip.

March - Early lock-up expiry (lol) + tech/growth correction. Dash dips and bleeds.

April 28 - rallies all the way back to $165, then the news drops -> https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/ DASH, GRUB, UBER, LYFT all take a hit on this day forward.

May 13 - Stock bleeds until this point to a new low of $110. Earnings report after market. Misses EPS again, but raises guidance. Future not entirely certain, but Dash isn't going anywhere. Highest revenue quarter ever, yet still lost money. 

May 14 (today) - Rallies up to 25% intra-day, sitting at $142 as I write this. One of the biggest pops of today, according to finviz. 


Why this garbage is primed to burn past today's rally - 

- Economy is going to open and inflation is coming. CPI report with the newest high since '08 and highest monthly jump pattern since 1960 or some shit, when your grandaddys were eating crayons to set the tone for his successors (you). That means less dashers and more people actually living life in the summer in the U S of A first time since the pandemic. 

- Had a breakout year where revenues more than 3x'd and still didn't make any money like GME bag holders, same with yesterday's earnings report for Q1 - still didn't make any freaking profits.

- Ongoing upheaval with legislative forces regarding the classification of its' employees as actual employees instead of ""gig workers"" who take it up the ass with no benefits and stability. Will have to pull money out the ass to pay up when push comes to shove. https://www.wired.com/story/uber-uk-drivers-workers-not-employees/

- Rallied 20%-25% TODAY after the revenue beat on earnings - still missed EPS (and lost money ofc), but some aNaLySt UpGrAdEs followed since last night - Wells Fargo to overweight, and Youssef Squali from Truist Securities upgraded to Buy at $185. You can look at his most recent price targets. https://i.imgur.com/NUPuFry.png (LOL) hint: I stopped reading at BABA 290.

And last but NOT LEAST...

- Doordash's FINAL lock-up expiry is coming in just about 3 weeks from now, here's the SEC filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm

here's the relevant photo showing the exact date, since December 9 - https://i.imgur.com/TCicUGK.png

This is Doordash's FINAL lock-up expiry on June 8, which basically has no restrictions around Rule 144 (things that exist to not plummet the stock). All the stocks that have been restricted and/or privately held, barring very unique and special conditions, will be let loose into the secondary/retail market, where us retards have been privileged to gobble up at a 40% premium to the initial IPO. Given current numbers, Dash is expecting to increase their current public float of ~150 million shares, to the ENTIRETY of ~300 million shares outstanding, with some extra ~30 million bound to underwriters or something. The float is about to increase at minimum 25%, at most, about 50%. To say the least, you can expect some profit taking for this garbage stock which, while it may survive, turns no profits at temporary record-breaking numbers aided by the worst pandemic in history during which had TRIPLED its' revenue.

positions: https://i.imgur.com/T73C5UY.png May 28 135 puts, I would buy more but I'm short on buying power atm.

ncl6bw,,wallstreetbets,post,1621032718,"$RBLX - DD# Introduction

I'm proud to say I've played my fair share of Roblox games. Back in the day, there were some goodies. It's actually insane how far people have pushed the limits of the Roblox engine, there's a surprising amount of at least *playable* games, which isn't what you'd expect from a kids platform. FPS's, RPGs, a fucking Pokemon game. A FUCKING POKEMON GAME. That game was a banger and I miss it, it got struck down by the iron hammer of Nintendo. Rest in peace Pokemon Brick Bronze, it had its own region to explore and everything in 3D.

Anyway, the point of giving this background is that I have personal experience with the platform, and if nothing else, it can produce relatively solid games, although I do think the quality has sunken a bit due to the sheer amount of users that have been accumulated these days (I wonder). If you're want to hold a stake in Roblox, I'd recommend checking out some of the games and seeing for yourself whether or not you think it has good prospects.

Now onto the good stuff. We'll be looking at its valuation, financial statistics, the important bits of Roblox's prospectus  (I will be referring to the updated [prospectus](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210513/A82VN62DZZ2RQZZZ2RJN2ZYPWOAKZZ22Z232/) for some financial statistics as well), the general moves Roblox as a company are making and how its consumer base (actual glue addict children) are responding to it.

Not financial advice, I was born without a cerebrum, and I'm addicted to glue sticks.

# Valuation

Finding a valuation for a stock that has only recently become a publicly traded company, a company operating in relatively uncharted territory for publicly traded companies no less, finding a fair valuation will have a whole lot of margin for error. Which is why you should take this section with a grain of salt. I'll be using its book value to determine a ballpark for valuation.

The stock (as of 5/14/21) has a market price per share is $70.75.

Roblox has 515,310,000 shares outstanding.

According to their 10k, In March, Roblox had $2,816,079,000 in assets, and they had $2,224,485,000 in liabilities. The difference is $591,594,000, which can be referred to as shareholder equity. If we take this number and divide it by shares outstanding, we get approximately $1.15 per share.

Now we take their market price, and divide it by their BVPS, which gives us 61.8 which is our price / book ratio. Yeah, that fucker is a little high.

Other established gaming companies and their P/B ratios:

EA: 5.04

TakeTwo: 6.0

Activision Blizzard (Fuck these guys. I'd short the shit out of them if I were a hedge fund): 4.70

So this means it's at a shitty valuation and going in will fuck you, right? Well, I'd also like to note the P/B back in Roblox's last reported quarter.

$1,847,800,000 -  $1,735,354,000 = $112,446,000

112,446,000 / 515,310,000 = $0.22 BVPS

We'll use their IPO price (\~$70) to determine last quarter's P/B

$70 / $0.22 = Around 318. Jesus fucking christ.

We can't even calculate P/E cause the company's still not profitable. By this metric, Roblox is overvalued as fuck. It's 2021 though, JPOW will turn your puts into dust no matter how hard you try.

However, this is only one way to look at it, and just because this metric doesn't add up doesn't mean there's not potential for great growth.

# Growth Potential

First off, let's take a look at its earnings + revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j4vzvplrp5z61.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15a82d5f4765e6518840dbf999fa021d8ac8465

Very good revenue growth, especially with the pandemic forcing glue eating children to play Super Hero Tycoon. However, the earnings growth is completely negative. Let's take a look at why that could be the case.

Let's take a look at their operating expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wyxje5ssp5z61.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=58a28fec8cc1fc77d8a661dc323133a05454281b

Their operating expenses far outstrip their gross profit, and in their expenses only doubled from 2019 - 2020. Here are the reasons I think this may be the case, from both using the prospectus and personal experience with the platform.

&#x200B;

* Developer Exchange Program: A program in which developers exchange Robux earned from their games to turn into tendies. Essentially, Roblox relies on these creators to create fun games for the platform, and in return they get tendies. Simple. Looking at the prospectus, from March 2020 - 2021 (will be using these date points a lot), developer exchange expenses shot up 267% from approximately $44M to $118M. If any of you degens have a useless coding degree, put that to use to develop Roblox games.
   * In my opinion, this is an incredibly bullish sign. Creators have figured out sustainable (or at the very least there's enough of them) business models for their games that incentives children to turn their tendies into virtual tendies to pay for gamepasses (basically a purchase to buy something in game. Thanks, EA). This means that developers are exchanging their hard earned virtual tendies for IRL tendies, and a whole lot of it. They will be incentivized to continue to develop on the platform in a positive feedback loop.
* Infrastructure and Trust and Safety: I'd imagine these are the expenses they incur from paying for their servers and their moderation. Basically, this is making sure 14 year old teenagers don't run around making Nazi paraphernalia. Fun fact, one of my friends got one of my accounts banned for doing that. Fucking hell. These expenses grew around 55% in the same time period (March 2020 - 2021).
   * Good things here too, this is making sure their platform doesn't turn into the wild west where people are role playing Nazis and building strip clubs. God, I wish it did, though it'd be terrible for your FDs.
* We'll tackle the R&D, General and Administrative, and Sales and Marketing expenses in the same section. All of these you can probably make a general assumption about what they do for Roblox as a company, so I'll list the statistics below.
   * R&D: 95.6% growth from March 2020 - 21
   * G&A: 208.3%
   * Sales and Marketing: 27%
      * Not much special here, it just signals that they still have a lot of room to grow as a company

I'd also like to refer you to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msq9jg/understanding_roblox_gamings_role_in_education/) qualitative analysis which explains why Roblox has such a unique business model that gives the platform a ton of potential for future growth. If you don't want to read this, here are some points that I think are important to this analysis in particular:

&#x200B;

* Roblox as a platform has the potential to encourage heutagogy, wherein students learn to be autonomous and learn different life skills through gaming as a medium.
   * I can definitely say Roblox improved my typing speed, yelling at kids requires decent typing.
* Roblox can encourage younger people with an affinity for coding / programming to learn by developing Roblox games. This can be a far more engaging way for a young degenerate to learn how to code instead of reading those weird paper wafers.
* STEM in general has been a weak area for American students, and Roblox can encourage habits that directly correlate with the field for young people.
   * ex. STEM fields: Architecture and Cloud Computing
* Developer Exchange Program is an incredibly innovative model with huge amounts of potential upside for Roblox as a company
   * Hell, I've heard rumors of like $60k a month from profitable Roblox games. Don't quote me on that.

Overall, Roblox's business model has huge potential upside if they can achieve these targets:

1. Sustainability: They need to nurture and keep a strong developerbase to continue to create and update games.
2. Reach: This large influx of users needs to stay interested in the platform to keep playing games and thereby increasing robux sales. (I'm still kind of mad about them removing tix...)

These two points are, in my opinion, the cornerstone of whether or not Roblox's model works. If their developers leave because Roblox failed to cater to them, they're not gonna have a platform; it goes up in flames. These developers also need players to play their game and incentivize them to keep developing for the platform.

# Assorted Financial Statistics

We've already went over their income statements, so let's move on to their balance sheet.

# Asset Growth

According to Yahoo Finance and their prospectus, their net assets grew by over 52.4%. From $1,847,800,000 to $2,816,079,000.

However, I will note their tangible book value and total capitalization are negative.

# Cash Flow

Yahoo finance states that their operating cash flow from 2019 - 2020 raised from $99,185,000 to  $524,340,000. This is an increase by **%428.6**. Now, the quarantine has DEFINITELY skewed this figure by a lot, but this creates a really good springboard into later years since this influx of players might stick around. Even with a conservative estimate of 40% of users joining the platform being sustained past the pandemic, that is still a substantial number of kids using their parents' tendies for virtual shit.

Their free cash flow also grew from $14,456,000 to $411,220,000. An increase of **2744.6%.**

They can, and already have been, use this cash to either reinvest into the growth of the company or keep in the bank should productivity on the platform reach a lull, whether due to school or just a lower amount of players entering the platform during a quarter.

&#x200B;

# Closing Bits and Personal Experiences

I went over my personal experiences with the game, but I might as well talk about some noteworthy games. Some of these are not what you'd consider hugely profitable but they were definitely much more on the entertaining end.

**Phantom Forces:** Battlefield inspired FPS with surprisingly tight gunplay and movement. Plus, fat, blocky hitboxes and kids with their dad's laptop makes you feel like a god.

**Blood and Iron:** Pretty niche but it's also pretty fun. Basically team deathmatch but its in the 18th - 19th century and everyone has muskets and speaks French. Also, you can play marching tunes with flutes.

**Pokemon Brick Bronze:** Actual Pokemon game with a development team that got shafted by Nintendo. It was so good that it got fucking targeted by our good friends in Japan. GodDAMN I miss this game. Unique gyms with unique layouts, 3D (albeit a little scuffed) pokemon models using the models in the actual games, and great and stylistic locations. I think there's remakes floating around but they will never beat the original. It was also paid access, and there were fucking tens of thousands playing it, so it's a very good example of just how talented these developers can be.

This game gets a mention exclusively because I'm salty. Fuck you, Nintendick.

**Arsenal:** Fun FPS mini-game type where you play Gun Game with various guns. They can get fucking wacky. It's developed by the folks at ROLVe (yes they're named after Valve) and it's built similarly to a source game. Pretty fun for short bursts of time.

**RoBeats:** Literally a Roblox rhythm type game (4 bars, notes flying down the track, no strumming) where you play songs and use the currency earned to buy new songs and stuff. Other than the fact most, if not all, of the songs are weird remixes it's still good fun. You can play with friends too so you can shit talk them for being bad.

**Assorted Anime Games:** Yeah, anime is a popular thing for 12-16 year olds, I can't exactly put my finger on it. Some of these also have a surprising amount of quality, so although most of them aren't for me today I do have some history with anime games.

If I had to give a price target, a conservative estimate would be around $85 in the summer months. Because of summer break, I'd say they'll at least beat earnings, if not downright fuck it because all the children will have more time to buy robux.

Currently no positions but to be on the safe side I'd buy shares. Growth is still not guaranteed, as above all else, they need to succeed in sustaining a playerbase and a developerbase. If they succeed in these two points, you'll make money.

If you really want to live dangerously, buy calls dated for after Q2 Earnings. Their results will be hugely skewed, once again, due to summer break for the glue eating kids. Or that's at least what I think will happen. It may not be as heavily skewed as the beginning of the pandemic, but I think they will still have very strong numbers.

Please voice your opinions in the comments and if you have corrections for any of the numbers here, I'll try to make sure I update it, but it's not guaranteed I will because I'm lazy.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Forgot to put a desc. for Assorted Anime Games because I'm retarded.

nci15o,,wallstreetbets,post,1621023753,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - May 10th to May 14thWhat’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season has largely come to an end, meaning we can slowly get back to “normal” movement among stocks, giving us some easier trading conditions! We’ve also had a whole plethora of real-world news, so without further ado, let’s get into it.

&nbsp;

- **At the start of the week, it was revealed that Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline operator in the United States, was taken hostage by hackers**. Most energy related stocks took a hit as the hack disrupted supply chains across many regions. By the end of the week, Colonial Pipeline reported that they’ve made substantial progress in safely restarting the pipeline system, and can report that product delivery has recommenced in most of the markets that they service. Unbeknownst to most, Colonial Pipeline revealed that they ended up paying nearly $5 million dollars to the hacking group to regain control of their pipes, likely explaining how they managed to get back up and running so quickly.

&nbsp;

- **Stocks plunged throughout the first half of the week**, likely due to investors realizing that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. These inflationary pressures  may then prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, which in turn would deliver a swift beatdown to most of our favourite tech and growth stocks. Furthermore, among these inflation fears, the CPI report was set to come out this week and confirm everyone's suspicions, so the market obviously had to price in a dogshit report before we could continue melting up.

&nbsp;

- **On Wednesday the CPI report came out**, and although the numbers weren’t the best, they were already priced in so the damage wasn’t all that bad. The CPI rose 4.2%, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis, compared to the respective estimates of 2.3% and 0.3%. While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they were expected, and with the SPY trading near ATHs for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of most tech stocks, the sell-offs were to be expected.

&nbsp;

- **On Thursday, the Department of Labour released their Weekly Unemployment Report**. The initial jobless claims came out to 473,000 vs. the 490,000 expected while continuing claims clocked in at 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected. Fairly average numbers, all things considered. We’re showing clear signs of recovery, albeit slowly.

&nbsp;

- **By Friday, most of the chop was resolved**. VIX plummeted, and most indices made up almost all the lost ground throughout the week. It seems as if the 24hr news cycle has made everyone's attention span too short for a bear market, as all problems are forgotten within a week. Inflation numbers are suspect, job numbers are suspect, but the market just keeps grinding up. Keep the music playing, and the good times rolling.

&nbsp;

- **This week's earnings reports were pleasant, with almost *every* reporting company catching some awesome gains**! Even shithole Doordash managed to deliver some returns to investors, clocking 22% gains in a single trading session. It was a stark contrast to last week, where most reporters slid instead. I’m truly sad that earnings season is coming to an end, as it has been good to me this quarter.

&nbsp;

All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! I hope you all had an awesome week, and made a fat stack of cash. If you would like a copy of these newspapers in advance, feel free to check out the Discord! I hope you all get to enjoy the nice weather and have a wonderful weekend! I’ll catch you all at the casino come Monday. Cheers 😎",['DOW']

> Ancient, powerful creatures whose origins lie in the distant past of the cosmos, no two Great Old Ones are exactly alike, although they tend to share similar traits. Most are colossal monstrosities formed from the very fabric of the universe and virtually impossible to destroy, have minds whose thought processes are incomprehensible to humans, show little to no regard for the consequences their actions may have on lesser beings, and drive to insanity any who look upon their true form. In addition, the majority of them are able to influence the minds of sentient creatures even when sleeping or dormant. Initially believed to have been merely indifferent to the fates of those unfortunate enough to be around them, recent writings have shown the majority of them to be actively hostile to the mortal population of the cosmos.

We traders are the foolish mortal cultists who attempt to harness the power of the Great Old Ones for our own benefit. We cast spells (i.e., trade stocks) in hope of getting rich. We study arcane rituals and crazy nonsense in hopes of finding the key to power (i.e., DD). Sometimes it works, but usually it destroys us. Even when it works, we're driven insane by the sheer incomprehensibility of our alien masters.",

nc7r7g,,wallstreetbets,post,1620996313,"Why are red days redder for Redditors? An analytical perspective!We have all seen it. SPY drops 2% and then there is a barrage of posts and comments about how it’s due to manipulation/next recession/long-overdue correction etc. I wanted to understand what causes such extreme reactions over small drops in SPY. There might be multiple reasons as mentioned in other posts such as inexperienced investors/lesser time in the market/volatile portfolio. While the first two cannot be proven analytically, we can definitely verify the volatile portfolio concept.

For this, first, we have to understand Beta. Put simply, Beta is the measure of the volatility of a stock in relation to the overall market. If we consider SPY as the benchmark, Beta of SPY would be 1. A high-risk tech company with a Beta of 1.75 would be more volatile than the market. I.e., if SPY returns 10% in one week, the company is expected to return 17.5% (75% more than SPY). But, this works both ways. If SPY drops 10%, the stock will drop 17.5%. Herein lies the problem.

Here is the list of most discussed stocks last month, along with their Beta values.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dr0pfv2j03z61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa1e53e426ef4cdd8a9b173e95776df015a83cb)

As you can see, almost all of the popular stocks in social media have extreme volatility. For e.g., PLTR has a Beta of 9.6! This means that the stock will drop a whopping 9.6% for every 1% drop in the market.

For analysis purposes, I am creating an equally distributed portfolio of these 9 stocks (Coinbase is not considered as it has not been trading long enough to calculate Beta). **The average Beta of this portfolio is 3.14!**

This implies that if SPY drops a mere 3% your portfolio would be down 9.3%. This value would be even higher in case you have a portfolio that is skewed towards CLOV or PLTR. What’s ironic here is that GME with its negative Beta can act as a hedge against red days!

**Limitations of the analysis:** One of the major assumptions with the analysis is that people who talk about stocks probably own that stock which might not be the case. Also, this analysis might not hold for future patterns since Beta accounts only for historical data and cannot predict where the market will go. Finally, the data is taken from nasdaq.com (as of 2nd May) and they haven’t exactly disclosed the time period or the benchmark they use for Beta calculation.

**Conclusion:**

As we can prove from the analysis, we significantly underestimate the overall risk we are taking by adding popular stocks to our portfolio. The phenomenal gains we see on good days can easily be taken away on red days which explains the overreaction. In other words,

nbx01s,gy1tanf,wallstreetbets,comment,1620956232,"To be frank, the continued downward movement of PLTR is a symptom of general market bearishness rather than an indictment of the company itself. The only true strike mark against them is with regards to stock based compensation maturing in this time frame, which means that they are in a period of dilution. That said, a multitude of government contracts which are growing in value and number, rapid expansion into the private sector, and one deep ass moat around their technology means that this company isnt going anywhere for the foreseeable future, and actually should be increasing in value far faster than the rate of dilution. Recent earnings were bullish as hell, with all goals met or beat, and 30% YoY guidance reaffirmed. 

In short, my estimation is that the bearish market right now is a blessing in disguise, as I expect this stock to slingshot upwards in value when market conditions permit. From there, I believe it will stabilize at a significantly higher price per share. At that point, long term high returns will most likely continue unless or until guidance is revised to a lower level.

But the few stocks that I have put research into are because I feel they were either going to make a strong comeback post COVID or I felt they were a strong yet underrated investment. XOM was a stock I researched heavily and felt it was massively undervalued at $34 a share over a year ago, that has been a great long hold because of its strong dividend. RCL was my quick gain play, I put a third of my total investment in and came out well over double. I have now moved all of that to ABNB, I have liked the company from before it even went public, they are the kings of their sector and “AirBNB” is a term many use just for simply renting a house, it is a name everyone knows and has became accustom with. That sector is rapidly growing and I feel they have the best grasp on it. Recently the stock has had a massive pull back and put it in pricing that I have taken advantage of because I feel it’s a steal for where they are headed. I’m currently holding 85 shares @ an average of 158 a share.

If AirBnB starts making corporate connections and let’s me book them for the rare business trip over hotels? Sign me the fuck up. I’ll take the cozy cottage with a sauna a five minute Uber away over the downtown hotel any day. Hell, last time a group of us went to SLC for a conference we did an AirBnB as it was way cheaper for the group to split over a hotel.

Greetings Gents,

 First off, this is not professional financial advice …invest at your own peril.

Quick explanation: 

This post will be analyzing relative rotation graphs for daily and weekly steps.

Daily steps most beneficial for a 3 month or less trend. Weekly analysis tends towards the +3ish month strategies, but favors longer timeframes.

The method utilized for developing these graphs is the Julius de Kempenaer method which plots the relative strength momentum against the relative strength ratio for a sector.

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

*Consumer staples (XLP) look strong in both the near and short term. Materials (XLB) is also looking strong.*

**Anything that looks like a good bet in the short term, but bad in the long term?**

*Energy and Financials are looking great right now. But their momentum is quickly dying off.*

**Anything that looks like a good bet in the long term, but bad in the short term?**

*Short term Real Estate momentum is slowing but has a ton of long-term momentum. Materials also have strong momentum in the long term, but there looks to be a bit of wavering in the short term. We might see a slight correction in materials followed by a little acceleration.*

**""This is a Casino Sir"" - My Bets/Positions:**

K – PCS - 6/18

MO – PCS - 6/18

VTRS – Long Call - 6/18

XLP – ZEBRA (Zero Extrinsic value Back RAtio) - 9/17

OXY – IC with bearish skew – 6/18

I'll also probably open some positions on companies within the XLB and XLRE sectors...but TBD on that.

FAQs:

**What are your strikes?**

*Shouldn’t matter. Pick your own strikes based on your personal risk tolerance.* 

**Why 24 bars?**

*Because I felt like it. And because it gives approximately a 6-month view on the weekly and about a month on the daily. Seems fine to me for getting a sense of direction.*

**Where are the FDs?**

*Not my thing, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it based on this info. To each their own.*

**What about sHoRt InTeReSt???**

*No.*

nbq63f,,wallstreetbets,post,1620936693,"Time to sell TSLAElon Musk is unstable and attention crazed. TSLA made a billion dollar investment and backed out in three months. This is either a lack of due diligence and incompetence OR a transparent attempt to manipulate earnings because they do not make enough money selling electric vehicles.

This is in addition to lack of vehicle demand in China. the long term future of Tesla is in the hands of a man stripped of his Chairmanship, is obsessed with his second rocket company and moonlights as a twitter/social media celebrity while also dating 20 year olds and hitting up night clubs. EDIT: He also uses TSLA as a credit card with 92 million shares pledged for loans EDIT 2: apparently grimes is 33. My bad. I was more alluding to their strange behavior together than the still quite sizable age gap

&#x200B;

Sell TSLA. There are better investments for your money. the stock is over valued because of Musk. Musk is becoming more and more unpredictable.

&#x200B;

Disclosure. no longer long TSLA other than through funds i otherwise like. own: gme, amc
