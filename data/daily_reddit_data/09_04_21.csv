Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Important background: They are studying treatment in the *adjuvant* setting (meaning after surgery). These people are typically cured with surgery alone, although recurrences can happen years later, sometime as long as 10 years later. This is also only in women with HER2-positive disease, a targetable protein on cancer cells with many drug targets.

In this study, they took women with node-positive and high risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease to surgery, then treated with their drug + trastuzumab (a standard anti-HER2 drug) vs placebo. They report better disease free survival:

https://i.imgur.com/gYQpclc.jpg

Important to note here that even without their drug, 89% of people did not recur after 5 years.

However, the biggest issue is that this isn’t how we treat node-positive, high risk HER2-positive disease anymore.  We instead prefer treating with *dual* anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab/pertuzumab) before surgery (neoadjuvant), followed by an additional anti-HER2 drug (TDM-1) if there’s anything left at the time of surgery.

Even if you don’t choose to have treatment in the neoadjuvant setting, you would typically combine trastuzumab with chemotherapy after surgery, rather than giving trastuzumab alone.

So I really don’t think these results are interpretable because they didn’t compare with the current standard of care.

Furthermore, there are a ton of anti-HER2 drugs available now, so this is a disease population with a lot of further treatments after recurrence.

What would be more interesting to see would be long-term overall survival in patients who have already progressed on standard trastuzumab/pertuzumab/TDM1. But as it stands, this data presented is very weak.",
mn9n5k,gtwl39i,stocks,comment,1617951467,"Cancer isn't the same thing in every person. Cancer is when one of your cells changes and continues growing abnormally to the detriment of the organism's health. Could be a cell in your breast, prostate, pancreas, brain, bone, intestinal lining, kidney, etc. It's basically a shit lottery for your cells. The good news is that it would take many successive mutations in cells to become malignant as your body constantly removes cells that don't function properly and there are multiple checks cells undergo before dividing. 

This study deals with mainly a type of breast cancer that expresses a certain protein on their cell membranes and activates an immune response. The trial number is 138 participants which might point to potential efficacy but will require tens of thousands of more to corroborate in P3 trials. There are many biotechs developing synthetic antibodies that will target specific cancer cell types but few if none are in contemporary use over chemo or excision. 

I think there is a lot of ignorance and misinformation about what cancer is and how it's treated. Especially with sensationalist headlines like this title.

Even if P3 is cleared the therapy is still years away from mainstream use. Immunotherapy cancer research is nothing new. Buying on this news seems very speculative to me. 

Results of a full-fledged P3 trial with tens of thousands of breast cancer cases with similar results would be much more promising. That would also require years of data too. Don't expect anyone will get an immunotherapy shot that cures their cancer but it could possibly be maintained as a chronic condition within the next decade or two much like how HIV is treated.

Rest assured that any biotech that can develop an efficacious, targeted cancer treatment that utilizes your own immune system to attack and cure cancer would literally be the scientific breakthrough of the 21st century if not on the same level as landing on the moon. 

It would cure a disease that organisms have had since the beginning of time. It would revolutionize cancer treatment and make obsolete all the treatments before it. If/when that happens the company could be worth trillions. I don't think this P2 trial result is that. 

Also, they had their IPO in Sept 2020. If you're sitting on something this big you don't need to go public as private investors/multinational governments would pump cash into you.",

mmsnc1,,stocks,post,1617891062,"Lumber DD: CNBC and Motley Fool's ""Best Lumber Stocks"" Unsurprisingly Are the Worst Price Performers or Are Unrelated to LumberI had to do this cathartic post because it is hilarious how wrong/clueless the mainstream financial analysts continue to be when discussing how investors could benefit as investors from the historic surge in lumber prices.

**Context for anyone living under a rock the last 6 months**

Lumber has been surging to all-time high prices recently, with every indication that it will continue to climb for the next few months due to how massive the new home construction demand and the busy season just getting started.  The price of dimensional lumber will likely dip at some point but will still stay at 2-3x its normal price into 2022 because of how insane the new housing construction boom.  

For those that have suggested otherwise in recent reddit posts, you’re wrong and this post isn’t about that debate.  Go look at the 2021 and 2022 projections for all of the big home builders (KB, TOL, LEN, DHI, etc…).  Every single one is projected to have record earnings the next two years from increased home construction even with the surge in lumber prices.

**The Financial Click-Bait “Best Lumber Stocks”**

If you’re new to lumber and google lumber stocks to maybe see what options are out there to look into, you no doubt have run into the same laughably annoying phenomenon that I did: the mainstream financial media/internet clickbait sites (like CNBC and Motley Fool) keep on producing the same regurgitated articles titled the “Best ___ Lumber Stocks” or “Best Ways to Play the Lumber Surge” which then offer the same regurgitated hot stock tips: 

1) they recommend stocks that produce exclusively **timber** (like RYN) which get NO BENEFITS from the surge in **lumber** prices *because timber (the logs which lumber is made from) aren’t the commodity whose price is surging 3-fold*; 

2) they recommend stocks that get a large portion of their revenue/enterprise value from things other than lumber (or have such a large stock float) so that the benefits of the lumber surge will be pretty diffuse and not have a proportional impact on their stock price (e.g. WY, a clickbait favorite); or 

3) they pitch stocks like LL, Home Depot and Lowes who have done well riding the home improvement wave, but don’t actually produce their dimensional lumber at all and thus have absolutely nothing to gain from the surge in dimensional lumber prices.

For those who want to invest in this lumber super cycle, it probably would be a good idea to invest in companies *whose earnings are actually tied to the price of lumber.*  Companies like WFG, CFPZF, IFSPF and RFP (This list is not exhaustive; these are just examples).  Companies like these that largely base almost all of their income on dimensional lumber, along with wood pulp and paper for some.  (Note: wood pulp surging to a new high as well, so these guys coincidentally are enjoying a double whammy this year).  And unlike WY, these lumber players don’t have nearly the volume of outstanding shares, so the surge in lumber prices is going to translate in a proportionally larger EPS growth.

If you look at the stock price histories of these lumber companies and compare it to the historical price of lumber, their prices largely track with the changes in lumber (and to some degree wood pulp pricing).  2013 and 2018 had surges in the price of lumber and these companies’ stock prices correlated with those surges.  Why? Because the price of lumber and wood pulp dictate these companies’ earnings.  If you look at the timber companies, like WY and RYN, their stock prices don’t track well to lumber prices because the price of timber is separate.  In fact, despite the epic lumber surge, some timber producers are still not doing well because there is a big glut of it in some areas of the continent.

**Let’s Look at the Numbers**

In the end, it’s the numbers that matter, so let’s look at the price performance of these stocks YTD, the last 6 months and the last year.  CNBC and Motley pitched RYN, WY, LL, HD, and LOW as the best stocks to play the lumber surge.  Let’s see how they have done the last year during this surge compared to the actual lumber companies:

**Shill Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/ihngsVA), [6 Months]( https://imgur.com/a/2LlbPN7), and [1 Year](https://imgur.com/a/GMgb6Ta)

Other than LL, all of them have been doing ok.  Some decent growth, all decently beating the SP.  But nothing spectacular and certainly nothing showing explosive stock price growth correlating with lumber’s explosive growth. (I’ll address outlier LL later.)

Now look at the **Lumber Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/CnYBrAb), [6 Months](https://imgur.com/a/qjTCQRQ), and [1 year](https://imgur.com/a/PAXODpp) 

I included WY to prove a point on how badly CNBC and Motley’s favorite “Best” pick has done compared to the actual lumber stocks.  If you look at their growth, as a group its substantially larger than WY or RYN, or these home improvement store stocks. 

**Take away from the charts:** 

The lumber stocks as a group have so far *destroyed* the shill stocks and actually show the type of growth you’d expect from a historic commodity surge.  Unsurprisingly, these lumber stocks particularly destroyed WY which is the most shilled stock by the financial clickbait media, and is probably why WY then seems to be regurgitated in a lot of the recent reddit posts on Canadian lumber stocks.  

For those correctly pointing out that LL is up 500% in the last year, if you caught that party in Q4, good job.  RFP is still beating than LL by over 200%, but still, great job.  That being said, LL’s surge isn’t because of lumber prices and any future growth again won’t be from the surge in price in dimensional lumber.  And you know that because the price of lumber has surged higher in the last three months, but LL is down ~20% in that same time frame.  Frankly, if you bought LL when CNBC told you to in January 2021, you’d be down 20-25%.  The point being that what propelled LL was not the surge in lumber and it’s future is not likely tied to any sustained lumber surge.

**Forward Looking Comments**

For those cynics who keep saying “Lumber cycle is over.  It’s priced in,” you don’t know what you’re talking about and here’s why.  These Canadian lumber stocks are all sitting roughly around their mid 2018 highs when Lumber surged to $600 MBF for 3 weeks in May 2018, and averaged about $550 MBF during the forestry’s Q2, and then crashed Q3/Q4 2018.  

For comparison, in 2021, lumber has been trading at over $1000 MBF since February, and the May futures just topped $1050 this week. [Here’s the CME futures yesterday.](https://imgur.com/a/TRWdKvE)  January 2022 futures are now closing in on $800 MBF.  It seems pretty clear all of these futures are rising and will continue to due so in the near term.  2021 earnings will likely blow 2018’s out of the water.  Yet despite the fact that these futures show these companies are about the have some of the best back-to-back quarters in industry history, they are still sitting at their 2018 highs... doesn’t sound priced in to me.

Case in point, here’s the basic [valuation ratios for the Lumber Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/fiefWln), and here’s the [valuation ratios for the Shill Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/8jd6SsU).  Despite the epic run these lumber stocks have had this last year, they are largely *still* relatively undervalued and have drastically better forward PE’s when compared to the shill stocks or other related industrial sector averages.  

**Conclusion**

I needed to write this cathartic post because I am sick of seeking these financial “professionals” shill the same mediocre/loser stocks as “the best lumber stocks” which have nothing to do with the production of lumber or are literally the worst price performers in the sector.  

I am not telling you what to buy and can’t predict who will do the best this year.  Each of the lumber stocks have their advantage and disadvantages depending on investor preferences. And who knows, maybe these shill stocks are on the cusp of some epic 1000% gains.  But if you want to find a way to benefit from the lumber surge, then it may be wise to invest in *lumber producers* who actually stand to directly gain from the surge in lumber and still have unrealized value to offer if market conditions stay on their current trajectory.  

If you are unsure if a stock you are looking at is timber or lumber, look at financial statements / website.  You will be able to see in a matter of seconds if their earnings come from timber and real estate or wood products/lumber that are actually surging in value.

Note: I am not a financial adviser.  If there is one take away from this post, **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**  Don’t trust strangers on the internet or TV.  Many of them are either lazy morons who keep regurgitating the same brainless clickbait they read somewhere or they have an ulterior motive and are selling you garbage. I'm long RFP but recognize that all of these lumber stocks will probably do well.","['GOOGL', 'WY', 'DHI', 'LEN', 'CME', 'HD']"

AAPL became the dominant player in smartphones because they came out with a product that was light years ahead of the competition.  That's essentially where TSLA is now with their EVs.  But eventually everyone caught up to AAPL and their smartphone share started dropping.  That is a huge risk for TSLA because 10 years from now every major auto company will be offering a full selection of EVs.  AAPL's longevity is due to their ability to pivot away from hardware and grow the services side of the business.  TSLA will have to do the same because they simply won't be able to remain the dominant EV player.  That's why lots of true TSLA bulls describe TSLA as a tech company, not an EV company.

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

mn374f,,stocks,post,1617920804,"FOMO starting to hit.I've been investing in a target retirement fund for a few years now.  Shamelessly I took a more active approach to investing right after the GME affair, about 2 months ago.

I don't have a lot of cash, and it was clear that we were coming off of a huge bull run after the Covid crash last year.  I didn't want to throw a whole lot of money into highly-valued stocks or ETFs, like ARKK.  In the end it looks like that was the right decision, at least at that moment.  Now might be a better entry point, not sure, it's also not one that's on my radar.

So I ended up doing some pretty defensive investments that have done pretty well for me these last 2 months. In fairness, what hasn't done well?  I had limited tech exposure and even those are racing upwards after the little pullback last month.

The idea, again, was to not pour a lot of money into stocks which were potentially at ATH (sorry, I tried timing the market) and also investing in things that would do alright in the event of a correction, since I don't want to lose this money in the short-to-mid term.  Once again, so far so good.

But man, it looks like stonks always go up!  Kidding, but this bull run looks like it has no end. Monetary policy is loose.  Economy set to reopen.  Massive stimulus.  What could go wrong? (somewhat kidding)

What I'm trying to say is that I was pretty bearish when I bought in 2 months ago, and now it looks like that prediction could have been wrong, and I'm experiencing FOMO. Can anyone relate?  

I was supposed to hold some dry powder in reserve, and a little bit of an extra cushion in savings, but man right now I just wanna buy buy buy.  Thoughts?

mn06x7,,stocks,post,1617912176,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 8, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 8, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

mnbio0,,stocks,post,1617951092,"Evaluation method of ETF / looking for input on thisHi there

I recently had a very interesting discussion with a friend of mine. We both are investing into ETF´s and exchanged positions and why we invested in them.

**His:**

1. World market ETF, and
2. World Market Small Caps.

**Mine:**

1. S%P 500
2. NASDAQ 100

He claimed my approach to investing would be ""wrong"".  


**My side:**I chose mine because - historically - the US Market grew the fastest , had the most stable growth and the most valued companies in the world are predominanty US based.I also chose those because

* S&P is diversified enough for me, and
* NASDAQ - being more tech heavy - offers even higher returns.

**His points:**I rely too heavily on the US Market (which I agreed with, reasons above).If I only invest in those indices, I will miss out on all the small caps taking off(which I countered that those small companies ""taking off"" make up such a small part of world market funds that the payoff is diluted because too many small companies never take off).

He also said that past performances are no indication of future performances. which I totally agree wih, YET its all we have to have an estimate on what avg returns might be. and an ETF that performed well for 20 years has shown to perform and work.  


**EDIT:**   
He chose his ETF´s to ""get his hands on as many stocks from as many companies world wide as possible, to be able to benefit from as many companies being successful as possible.   
also, as a way to hedge against any singular market (US, Tech, whatever) going under.   


I would say to this that in theory it sounds great, but almost all world etf´s and emerging market caps hold basically the same titles (e.g BABA Tencent etc.) to get their main growth / value.  


also my gut tells me that if you hold 1000 stocks, one significantly moving doesn´t make such a difference as it would if you had only 10. thus an ETF with too big of a portfolio doesn´t generate the returns a smaller ETF would. UNLESS the spread out ETF holds significant percentages of their overall value in companies moving enough.

mnehgh,,stocks,post,1617965059,"Question about choosing a brokerageI’ve seen a number of threads across several investing-related subs discussing which brokerages people prefer.  They usually cite things like quality of user interface, availability of stocks, helpfulness of customer support, and/or low-no commission.  I walked away realizing that it is (almost) all about personal preference, but without knowing if there are actual quantitative reasons to choose one brokerage over another- besides price of course.

So, I want to ask: What are some things to consider when choosing a brokerage that a newbie could easily overlook, other than what I’ve listed above?

To that point, say you find a new brokerage whose services you think are superior to those of your current brokerage.  Is it worth paying the $75ish transfer fee (obviously depending on the brokerage) to have your portfolio transferred to the new service?

I’m asking the question generally, but to be more specific I began trading/investing about a year ago using Robinhood.  Now that I’ve grown more comfortable, I’m looking for something a little more... _robust_.  Could I actually benefit from the move or would it be pointless?

Again, I realize that personal preference is a big factor in this decision, but I’m seeking advice anyway to make sure that I’m not missing something.

(No one in my immediate family/social circle has investing experience or I would talk to them.  Instead, I’m asking strangers on the internet, I imagine a lot of people on this sub can relate.)",

mne6rr,,stocks,post,1617963748,"How to calculate your Break-Even rate:This post is made to help investors calculate their break even rate relative to inflation and tax risk; and is especially important to investors who are diversified into foreign investments. 

With regard to purchasing power, Inflation and taxes can easily erode your profits/gains over time. Even more so, when you enter and exit trades consistently over the long-term or if investments are placed in a non-tax sheltered account. 

Your break-even rate is the rate of return you need to make just to keep up your purchasing power level, not including brokerage fees.

To calculate, first estimate the rate of inflation you expect to experience over the next year, you can refer to the Bureau of Labour statistics (BLS) which also publishes the Consumer price index (CPI) which is a measure of inflation. (For the U.S)

To calculate your break-even rate you can use the formula: (i) / (100 - E) = B

I: Inflation 
E: Effective tax-rate 
B: Break-even rate

Ex. If you assume a (2%) inflation over the coming year and your combined tax rate is 44% then your break even rate is: 

2/ (100 - 44)  x100 = (3.6%). {Example Only}. 

About 3.6% “Net” on your portfolio to maintain your purchasing power. Earning this rate does not provide any real profits, it only maintains the value of your investments. 

If you are earning less than your break-even rate after taxes and inflation have been taken into account, you are actually losing money on your total investments and may have to accept high risk just to maintain your purchasing power.

Of course, if you are having trouble achieving alphas when applying an active management strategy, you can always switch to a more passive, indexing buy and hold strategy while assuming less risk. 

Edit: This post is focused on the concept of inflation/tax risk and how to calculate ones break-even rate. 

Not investment objectives, strategies, capital limitations etc. Pls keep comments relative to the topic. :)",

I am a new being to this type of world so take it easy and explain it to me as if I was 10.",
mn58r4,gtvlryt,stocks,comment,1617929167,"I don't think it's been explicitly stated, but if you are investing in dividend stocks, you should be re-investing those dividends into more stocks through DRIP (dividend reinvestment program). This way a stock that pays 3% dividends and grows 5% per year will snowball on itself and can turn into a very profitable endeavor. In essence, the company grows and gives you more shares, which further grow and give you more shares. 

In some sense, with DRIP on, the growth is similar to any other investment. They actually typically have less growth than growth companies, but the upside is that the companies that pay out dividends are the ones that are well established, have a good cash flow, and are fully mature to the point that they do not want to grow. This may sound silly, but AT&T is a company that is fully mature, makes a lot of money, and isn't experimenting with groundbreaking new technology or otherwise. So what do they do with their money? They give it out as dividends. Other companies like Tesla, for instance, don't pay dividends because they take all the stock growth and reinvest it in new technology, factories, etc. 

The point I'm getting at is that typically dividend stocks are secure. It's much less likely that Coca Cola (a famous dividend stock) will go belly up and lose your life savings rather than the hot new biotech company. So after 30 years of racking up meager, yet substantial gains, you hopefully should be able to cash out of the stocks if you need to or simply turn DRIP off and start pocketing the dividends rather than re-investing them. 

A common and I think recommended strategy is to start in growth companies when someone is young (because it gives time to bounce back from upsets and potentially have better growth), and then gradually transition into value, dividend stocks near retirement. The lower risk of the stocks gives you security once you are no longer working and the dividends can directly pay for living expenses. If someone is able to and has the wherewithal, it's not uncommon to have investment funds reach at or near 1 million dollars by retirement, in which case a standard, healthy dividend rate of 3% would pay 30k per year (while still hopefully holding value in case you just need to sell all the stocks for one reason or another).

For more information on strategies like these, I would recommend /r/dividends. /r/investing also just has good advice on broad strategies",['TSLA']

mn58r4,gtvjgj4,stocks,comment,1617927982,"Dividends stocks tend to be safe/low-risk, but also slow to grow - startups and companies with exponential growth will have ideas to spend $ on, debts to pay, markets to expand into, and paying out dividends won't be a priority for them, whereas something established without much competition like a power company won't be looking to expand or spend more $ than needed on maintenance/upgrades, won't be doing much R&D work, and thus be more likely to have nothing else better to do with $ than to give it out to it's investors

mn8h8e,,stocks,post,1617938541,"SeaChange International DD and all the sea that is changing, well internationally.It's my first DD.

About SeaChange.

SeaChange is a leading supplier of Video Delivery Software Solutions.

Our solution powers hundreds of cloud and on-premise video delivery platforms, servicing over 50 million subscribers worldwide. SeaChange offers value-based engagement which provides content and service providers with a complete software delivery platform for linear, VOD and TSTV over managed and unmanaged networks. The SeaChange Framework solution includes video back-office, media asset management, targeted advertising management, analytics and the client interface for STBs, Smart-TVs and mobile devices. Our solution is available as a product or managed service deployed on-premises, in the cloud or as a hybrid.

On 3/29/21 SeaChange made the announcement that they and landed a multi year multimillion dollar deal with one of the biggest broadband providers in the United States which over the next 48 hours doubled their share from $1.03 to into the $2 range and their volume:

3/29: 386 million  
3/30: 50 million  
3/31: 30 million

These numbers are way outside of their average which is now looking like 10 million

Right now there is speculation on who the deal is with. A few hours of research and it's a fair assumption to go with Comcast.

Comcast and SeaChange have done business some 20 years ago and their contract is available online for anyone to lookup. I dont think i can post links but contracts.onecle .com/seachange/ comcast.video.2000.12.01.shtml

A very interesting clause in this contract pertains to the announcement:

SeaChange and Comcast shall agree on the form and content of any public announcement that shall be made concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither SeaChange nor Comcast shall make any such public announcement without the consent of the other, except as required by law.

Sounds like a real dickish thing to do in a contract but it does explain why the announcement was so vague and only giving as much information as they are allowed.

There is also the Q4 report from Comcast where they are planning move to virtualization as well as a few things i noticed on a social networking platform.

The announcement is anticipated to be in the earnings call on Tuesday April 13th at 5:00pm ET

On 3/30 there was an announcement for a public offering of 10 million shares at $1.85 per share that was quickly filled. Aegis Capital Corp. is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering and is now closed.

During 2020, SeaChange went from selling individual services to full turnkey solutions. Their legacy framework sales are down but they are correlated the increase of their new framework. This is a huge sign of customer retention and migration on to the new platform as well as securing new business.

**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 and Recent Operational Highlights**

* Secured a record 11 customer wins with multi-year commitments for the Framework video delivery platform, amounting to more than $15 million in total contract value and bringing the total number of Framework customers to 26 with more than $54 million in total contract value.

**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results**

* Total revenue increased 14% to $19.3 million from $17.0 million in the same period last year. Product revenue increased 69% to $13.2 million (69% of total revenue) from $7.8 million (46% of revenue) in the same period last year. Service revenue decreased 33% to $6.1 million (31% of total revenue) from $9.1 million (54% of total revenue) in the same period last year.

* Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $13.9 million at year-end, and **no debt**.

Yes, they are cash flow positive and on top of that they have a 20 million dollar offering which puts them in a very good place for either expansion or acquisition. They have also been busy with a number of 8-k filings over the last 2 weeks.

Overall, they have a pretty slick product and i recommend anyone to go to their website and check them out. They have a solid solution. Reading through their contracts from 20 years ago was so nostalgic when they are standing up infrastructure on 18gb drives with regedits and mpeg2 formatted video but i digress.

As it stands today, i believe that there are we are approaching T-6 (4/2 was no trading) where it could get really interesting. Looking at iborrowdesk and fintel this has been shorted to oblivion and well into the 400 millions of shares.

Insider trading looks good and no sales in the last 60 days.

mmt6jd,,stocks,post,1617892593,"What stocks are actually well priced or even undervalued right now or is the answer nothing?I'm looking at the market and it seems like most stocks are still heavily inflated. Tech seems to be down, however, does seems like it'll likely be a bit shaky in the near future, given interest rates, inflation, heavy market uncertainty, and actually when you zoom out on the 1-year graph, most of tech is still very high, compared to just under a year ago. The losses from many posts seem to just be from people buying at ATHs. 

On another note, non-tech stocks looks like they're more likely to go up in the near future, however have now already risen, and at all time highs, or near it. I'm looking at Starbucks, JPM, DIS, TGT, but really works for most promising non-tech stocks.    


Seems like we're basically choosing between decent, not necessarily good or bad, but just okay priced stocks that will probably be flat in the near future, and will become a long-hold, or stocks that may also be a great long-term hold, but at very ATH prices, that we should probably expect the major gains to be over, and will likely just to be buying to go up 10% end of year, unless there's something I'm overlooking, of course ""well priced"" is also subjective, so figured I'd ask and grab some opinions.","['TGT', 'DIS', 'JPM', 'SBUX']"

LI-S is working on making sulphur batteries with its group company BNNT.  . 

If they get lithium sulphur batteries to work its like a quantum leap forward in the battery world. They will be used in every single thing.

**LI-S batteries can store 5x more power, half price, charge 4x quicker and are 1/3rd the weight.**

**That is a technology break through in battery tech that is a quantum leap imo. How many companies might want to play with those advantages? Teslas big pumped up battery day needed this battery. Imagine what Tesla stock would have done if he came out with the above specs?**

PPK also did a dividend payout in LI-S stock but my not sure how that worked as LI-S is not listed. I have read it should be listed December 2021.

I recently had a relative pass away and TOD me some stocks. I was interested in diversifying these stocks as they are all in one company.

And I like to have some extra feedback on what people think of my choices. I'm 21 years old so I can have a little risk and have the time to wait.

My picks for now are (prices between brackets are estimated in euros)

8 shares of Volkswagen (1980), because of their growing EV share and their investments in this technology

5 shares of Apple (547), because I do believe Apple will stay for a little while and I do not own any apple shares at the moment

5 shares of Microsoft (1000) same reason as with apple, do not own any Microsoft 

6 shares of Disney (950), Also I love Disney, believe in their diversified product, and still see some potential to grow in the future 

400 shares (1000) of International consolidates airlines group, I already own a bunch as a Corona play, I believe the stock will raise when we can fly again, the airline is too big en too import to fall for now in my opinion. 

then ill still have a little over 600 euros (or a little more) to spend where I'm really curious what to pick then. 

\- I was thinking about buying (yes i know spacs bleh) some MUDS because of their merger with Topss with a great valuation

\- Maybe Maxar technologies Because it still has potential and space 

\- Corsair because of the potential

\- Or ABN AMRO (a dutch bank) who still has some problems thanks to COVID

I would like to hear everyone's opinion on this list, or maybe you know a stock that's not on the list for the remaining 600 euros I would also like to hear it in that case!

mngn92,gtxcsdu,stocks,comment,1617973565,"AAPL MSFT DIS are all solid picks.  Personally I think March last year would’ve been the play for airlines, LATEST beginning of this year.  Airline stocks are all priced in and most have a higher valuation than pre corona as markets are forward looking (look at market cap, not share price).  I’m personally starting to exit most of my airline positions but I’ve recently opened a position on Aercap due to their acquisition of GMs aeronautics division and their market dominance, it’s sort of a “spread the risk” play.  This is not investment advice, do your own DD.

VWAGY is solid but there’s inherent risk if you’re looking for a pop in the price for the EV play.  That whole area is a bit iffy right now as it matures and the small companies get eaten up.  VWAGY could be a winner or it could just chug along, either way it’s relatively safe but there’s an argument to be made on if your money is better utilized elsewhere.

mnbcy5,,stocks,post,1617950366,"Do you think social investing is worth it?I have been conflicted for past year over the idea of social investing etfs. I like and respect that strategy to pull out companies that pollute too much (oil companies) or are involved in excessive deforestation/unsustainable practices or manufacture certain products (cigarettes and weapons of war manufacturers). 

However, diversification drops quite a bit in the process. Let's take the 2 big ones. VTI vs ESGV (social investing fund). VTI has something like 3,500 companies and esgv is around 1,500. Fees wise, vti is 0.03% and esgv is 0.12%. Performance-wise, both have pretty much been equal over last couple years, but YTD 2021 vti is ahead by 1% growth.

What would your take be on this? Worth it in the big picture to not invest in non-environmental friendly companies? Where do you draw the line between profiting and ethics/morals? Do you draw the line at all? Truth be told, there is plenty of money to be with social investing so its not like losing money. Diversification drops though from 3,500 to 1,500 (the extra percentages are equally divided up based on index breakdown).",

mmtv9z,,stocks,post,1617894576,"A rare bullish DD for PLUG, & Hydrogen in generalI wrote this originally as a comment, but it got upvotes relatively quickly, so I think I'll make a DD on this. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. I have my eyes on $APD, personally I think thats a good long term bet, but PLUG is one of them more riskier plays. With their creation of Hydrogen plants, plus one of the biggest hydrogen plants in the US, I'm very confident they will be profitable in the future. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

My thoughts on PLUG is that it's a bit of a lottery play. Their hydrogen plants should make them profitable in the future pretty easily, but any major developments in their fuelcell technology, or any adoption of their technology in popular car brands could easily give them a triple digit valuation over the next 10 years. However, I'm extremely bullish on Hydrogen producers, like $APD. They have great earnings, normal P/E ratios, and great growth prospects over the coming years.",['APD']

Hydrogen was big 10 years ago, but even then the estimates were that it will take over in the medium term (20-30 years). US Dept of Energy even as they pushed batteries acknowledged that hydrogen vehicles will take over eventually due to storage and production benefits. I personally will not buy into any hydrogen economy plays as it is not a real economy at the moment outside of warehouses. 30 years ago who would you invest in for solar panels and are those companies still around or did china run them out of business?

Hydrogen production is mainly based on natural gas right now, so won't even be a green industry until natural gas prices rise.

When you think the producers and suppliers of hydrogen will be profitable, you have to consider the baseline, gasoline prices and now electric battery prices. Energy is still cheap. Hydrogen is easy to produce. But there is not financial incentive for the switch in the near term.",

If you have read about family that basically runs VIAC they been reported saying that to compete with major streamers (Netflix and others) all smaller media companies have to consolidate into one mega corp to have bargaining power for sports streaming and media portfolio that can compete with major streamers. They been saying this for a while actually and the first step was to merge Viacom with CBS. That came to be (with some corporate drama) and now rumour is that when this merger is digested ViacomCBS will merge with Discovery (and it's quite legit rumour confirmed from multi sources). Also, there are other rumours (less confirmed) that ViacomCBS might buy out or merge with Lionsgate and/or MGM. They been eyeing Sony studios but Sony is unlikely to sell. Anyway, if all goes to plan in few years time we could have mega streaming corp that owns most of the ""legacy"" TV shows and films. That's a strategy that I like and that I think makes sense. I also love how VIAC approaches streaming. Which is that they have their own platform but also license out their content to Netflix and Amazon. It's better to collect licensing money from big players than to fight with them. Pretty smart. At current valuation of 10x p/e (priced for nuclear war) I'm willing to take long bet and wait this out for few years. I think there could be some very nice appreciation. I mean if you look at peer companies they are priced at similar PE from 9x to 14x so I don't think it should go down much more. Worst case it will go sideways and I'll collect pretty good divi.

* The market reacted fairly positively to the Fed's FOMC minutes yesterday.
* We have broken above our hardest resistance line in premarket trading. The next really strong resistance line is the all-time high.

**Bear Case:**

* J. Powell is speaking at noon.
* [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) are higher than expected.

It looks to me like the bulls are going to beat the bears today. J. Powell has historically been a market killer, but his speech today isn't very important and isn't being hyped-up. It seems like the market might ignore it -- especially with Biden continuing his so far perfect track record of pumping up the market.

If you want greater lower cap exposure, I'd recommend using some ratio between VOO and VTI, because they're both 3% maintenance and together can cover several distributions of small, med, and large market cap within your portfolio.

VOO is obviously 100% large cap, and VTI despite being total market is still 70% large market cap.

I personally do a 50:50 split, and get 10% medium cap, and 5% small cap exposure, and 85% large cap all at a 3% maintenance fee.

Going hard on small and medium cap companies is higher risk. Big companies will more regularly make money. Up to you! If you want more than 20% medium or 10% small cap weight then this strategy won't work for you. If that sounds right, just buy VTI.

I'm a new and young investor who is interested in making long-term buys of companies I think will do well long-term. I've read The Intelligent Investor and I've really taken to heart the idea to buy stocks for the long term. 

I understand that compound interest is the best way to go, but once I'm interested in a stock, it's hard for me not to immediately buy and wait for a good price. I think ""oh, I don't want this stock to increase in price before I buy it, so I'll buy it now."" With compound growth, even a 5-10% difference in the short term doesn't make much difference in the long term. 

For example, if I find a stock I like and conclude from my research I like it, even if the stock is on a big up day, I'll buy it immediately. 

How do you manage your emotions when buying and make plans to buy into a stock you like? Is a short term DCA (over something like the span of a few weeks) a good idea?

This really brought to my attention Buffet's quote of ""be fearful when others are **greedy**, and **greedy** when others are fearful.” I noticed this is occurring within your typical Chinese stocks. Many of these we talk about quite often in this sub. 

Looking at companies like $BABA, $TME, $BIDU, $JD and $IQ, most of them have fallen anywhere from 15-48%. Recent news has mentioned that the hedge funds and banks are letting go of their Chinese holdings but I believe this is a great buying opportunity strictly due to the low prices and Munger's new position. 

Most of them still have pretty high analyst PT's but their P/E's and P/S's stick out like a sour thumb. All of these companies are stuck below the 42 zone on the RSi and show massive growth for the EPS. Being able to pay off any debts and having Jack Ma, the idiot who spoke against a communist government finally out from CEO of BABA, may now let us see the only upside potential we've been waiting for. BTW, hearing Munger's opinion on Jack Ma's actions and him stepping down seriously makes me believe BABA is a gold mine with purchasing LEAPS. Much more of a safer bet with him out of the eqaution. 

I still have a great interest in these companies and want to hear some of your opinions on this. I did purchase today 600 shares of $IQ @ 18.54 to add a new stock into my portfolio with me already having LEAPS on BABA and a decent amount of money in JD @ 84 per share.

That's what a lot of those random capital stocks are.  Right now I'm up to about $50 a month from dividends which I am reinvesting.  My main concern is that moving forward past the summer, norweigein and spirit will even out (I do think it still has room to gain a bit) and I will be clueless what to do besides sell my shares...by that point ill have held for more than a year for tax purposes.

My goal is to continue to add maybe 100 bucks a week, maybe 50 into dividend/blue/whatever and have 50 a week for growth/tech/ or take some shots at more options.  (i have 1 long term with norweigein currently that I just added)

3. Yes - I don’t actively trade regularly - but I check frequently just to see news about stocks I’m in.

4. Invest in what you know - you should be able to explain in three sentences what a company does and why you’re invested. Start small - watch and see how things work. Index funds and ETFs are a good starting point while you’re learning. 

5. Various reasons - mostly in large cap stable stocks. BA, WFC, AAPL, TGT, DIS, etc. I know it’s not likely to 10x my money, but just looking for consistent growth over long period (30 years)

6. Marijuana, alternative energy, and bioscience/pharma, fintech.

7. Stocks they can’t explain what the company does. Penny stocks are basically gambling. 

8. Month too small of a window to have any clue what they’ll look like. 

9. Of course - but just basics like bought too high (what I thought was a dip, but it dipped more), sold with meat on the bone, etc. - but I haven’t made any like I bought 1,000 shares when I wanted to buy 100 shares.

10. Nothing - unless something has drastically changed about the company. If AAPL dives 10% in a week - I’m not selling. If I have free cash - I might buy more.

4. Start investing in companies you use in your life, but at the same time if you are young invest in a penny stock and a few other “What If” tech stocks. This helps you understand how the market works and you’ll appreciate the value of a dollar more
5. I did my research, sat on my computer a lot and just watched the candles do their thing. For shorting I see what’s being talked about a lot and also use stock screeners to find breakouts

9. I invested based off of friend’s DD rather than doing my own. I also lost some money on AMC trying to “fit in.” Word of advice if WSB says do one thing, you do the opposite!
10. I would buy more shares if I believe in the company and I would hold if I have no additional funds. I have faith in my stocks and my short selling will more likely cover any losses I incur.

I don’t think people are aware of these I think people focus too much on spending on physical products that bring them short-term satisfaction rather than long-term intangible wealth

mmy1qn,gtucw85,stocks,comment,1617908274,"Hey! For the record, I'm only 18 years, been learning about stocks and the market for about 3 months, so I even though I won't be able to provide the same advice as someone with experience would, I think a couple of things I know could help you!

&#x200B;

1. Started investing at 18
2. I have always been interested in financial related things, and I was always very careful with the way I spent money. So, as soon as I turned 18, wanted to learn how to make my money work for me
3. Yes still investing lol
4. If you're looking to invest: I recommend you don't for at least a few feeks / months (assuming you know nothing about the market and haven't done proper research. Especially with the recent instable market, don't jump in now. You might miss out on some profits, but you could also lose big. So learn what are stocks, etf, ctfs, mutual funds, try to learn the meaning of words (PE ratio, payout ratio, CAGR, etc.), then you will able to learn about specific companies / funds. Also, try understand the benefits of different investing strategies : Dividend growth investing (DGI), 3 fund investing, growth investing, etc. That will help you decide which type of investor you are and the reasons why you should stick to a SPECIFIC plan.
5. I haven't bought many things as of today, but I plan on doing that, and some factors influence me a lot. I'm canadian, so I try to limit the amount of US / World currency forex fees. Of course I can't buy Visa without exchanging currencies, but I try to find canadian ETFs tracking the US market or world market. Also, I know that I want to hold specific companies, and follow what's happening in their business. I don't want to passive invest in a mutual fund my whole life. So although I love some ETFs (SMH: Semi Conductors, VUN: Canadian equivalent of VTI, etc) I want to allocate a part of my portfolio to stock picking.
6. No idea tbh. Haven't done research on emerging market.
7. Speculative stocks. For example, many stocks in the EV / Green sector. I'm not against the green movement, I'm just against betting with no fundamentals. Yes, a certain company in the clean energy sector could be the next Chevron (CVX). But the chance of that happening is small, and I would much rather have lower returns than literally gambling my money. I think investing in Visa, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple is wiser than investing in already-over-valued companies.
8. Honestly, if financial analysts can't even properly predict that, no one on this subreddit can. But, in my newbie opinion, I think markets will trade sideways for a while. i don't expect a crash with all the printing / support that the American market receives, but a growth like the past year isn't sustainable.  But people have no reason atm with Covid to remove money from the market, so I don't see why it would crash.
9. If I have made a mistake? Going to early in the market. I bought some ARKG-ARKQ stocks a week or two after the initial correction in march, because I thought they were crazy cheap. Turns out that I dont even want to hold them anymore. Not because of the 5-10% loss, but only because these ETFs do not fit my investing mind and strategy. I chased performance and regretted it because I hold something I don't even like.  Also, although people say 'time in the market is more important than timing the market', don't listen to it when you're learning. Its a valuable strategy if you know what you're doing and following a specific strategy, but don't go all in right now, without enough information, just because you don't wanna miss out on some gains.
10. I would hold if my stocks were declining, depending on the reason. If I think the future of the company isn't at risk, I will hold. There's a reason why I bought the stock to begin with, and it's because I thought it had real future value, so I'm not going to sell because of a correction  (even 15%+ in price). Would I be anxious? Probably. But trading out of fear isn't going to resolve the problem : I still lost money. So before considering selling, I will try to see if my initial reason for investing still stand. If they do stand, then I hold.
11. Well, of course people know about stocks, ETFs, CTFs, mutual funds and the stock market in general. But, I invested some play money in crypto currency for a few reasons. I want to learn how it works, how it can be used, and why is it so popular. I understand, crypto is considered risky af and based on nothing as of today, but maybe that in the future, it will play a bigger role in our life, so I would much rather learn today than tomorrow. Also, you can invest in real estate, in YOURSELF (knowledge, fun, etc.). I dont know much about real estate though, so can't really elaborate. But I think enjoying my life is as important as having a good financial situation, so I won't drop my hobbies and the activities I love for the sake of increasing my networth. I limit my spendings on short-term benefits that aren't really useful, but still spend on what I love (family, girlfriend, etc.).","['MSFT', 'CVX', 'AAPL', 'NVDA']"

2. I grew up in poverty with an alcoholic father. We always had money issues. So it’s my goal to have financial freedom, to be able to care for my family, when the time comes. In the UK we have a Roth IRA called a LISA which gives you £1 for every £4 you invest. So each year I invest £4K and you get a government bonus of £1K. 

3. Yes

4. If this is your first time investing, I recommend you start investing in an S&P 500 index. It’s pretty safe and the fees are usually quite low.

5. Personally I like to invest in things that I use everyday. Like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla etc... Recently I’ve been using the website ‘Simply Wall St’ for ideas.

6. I think the next big thing in 5/10 years is Artificial Intelligence. Like imagine an app that can detect medical conditions, that could significantly change the American Health system by removing a lot of administration.

7. Penny Stocks, lots of people just pump and dump them.

8. By next year I’d expect between a 11% and 20% return.

9. When I was starting out, I panicked sold an index. Ended up buying it again for a cheaper price and it’s been one of my best investments. Happy accident I guess haha.

10. Have a stop loss set up, so you’re able to cut your loses where needed.

11. Yes, I had a crypto investment. I’ve sold this for a profit, since that market is far too volatile. Also used to own some crypto kitties.","['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'TSLA']"

mmuhjt,,stocks,post,1617896385,"What are your thoughts on EV charging? Too much, too early?Hi all,

Looking at Chargepoint and Blink charging.  They've had insane runups the past year.  My understanding is that it wasn't anything these companies did, but they just happened to be EV charging companies right as Biden took presidency and legislation started to get written in for EV.  They're just riding the wave.  I feel like people are just rushing into these charging stocks based on the sector alone and not the company.  Both have very high short interest.

For ex, Blink charging - How are they worth 2bil?  According to yahoo finance their total revenue in 2020 was 6.23 million.  Although it's significant growth from the year before, they're unprofitable and are in a business with thin margins.  Although there's the infrastructure bill, there's no news as to whether Blink has actually been offered government contracts, and that larger competitors will get them instead.  The culper research report didn't help either.

However, blink is in the right space and is an early player in the booming space.  What are your thoughts?  Is this an EV charging bubble just like weed stocks not too long ago?  What will be the catalyst to bring things back down?  Could these companies actually ever somehow justify their valuations?

Thanks!",

mn3o59,,stocks,post,1617922278,"Understanding Stock Lingo?Article about stock I was interested in:

>11 analyst(s) have assigned their ratings of the stock’s forecast evaluation on a scale of 1.00-5.00 to indicate a strong buy to a strong sell recommendation. **The stock is rated as a Hold by none analyst(s), 8 recommend it as a Buy** and 3 called the NOVA stock Outperform. In the meantime, none analyst(s) believe the stock as Underperform and none think it is a Sell. Thus, investors eager to increase their holdings of the company’s stock will have an opportunity to do so as the average rating for the stock is Buy. 

I'm not understanding why 8 analysts would recommend buying, but 0 recommend holding?

If the stock is at $10 and they think it will go to $20, then (to me) it makes sense both to buy at the current price of $10 and if you already have shares to hold.  

Are these somehow mutually exclusive?  Does the analysts recommending against holding (0 recommend holding) imply they are telling people to sell at the current price?",

(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

**last edit: swords for plowshares boys**

That -50% has happened, it's done. Selling it and forgetting the shame/ deleting the big red numbers on the screen doesn't help you in any way in of itself. I might have grabbed the wrong end of the stick hear so apologies if that's so but you have to get over it and look unemotionally at the future moves if you are to learn from it.
For instance, personally I've been adding most to positions I have which are currently -40 and -60% because I still love what they're trying to do and they've just been hammered by wider market moves. I probably bought a little expensive admittedly but I believe the price is so good that I get a great opportunity to buy lots more. However there have been multiple others where I've gone 'yup that was dumb, I got suckered in to the hype/rally/gains/herd' and I've had to admit I was stupid and try to regain composure and perspective.

 To actually (not) answer your question instead of blithering on... 
Quick and simple test. Imagine you have no history with the stock, forget it ever existed. Now re evaluate it fresh based on your current metrics/ it's current outlook. Does it look like good value at the price it currently is with all the potential/ risk that is has?
Your risk profile is yours alone, there are as many answers to 'individual stock or broad based etf?' as there are investors. Truth is you can't make it a binary question so try not to. Broadbase ETFs are never going to be the wrong choice, by definition they are the safest exposure to pure securities. They just might not be THE best choice. Perhaps reduce the position, sell 25\50% or some portion now to appease yourself and move it if that makes you feel more comfortable and able to feel confident again.

mmar4u,,stocks,post,1617826093,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 7, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021**

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the \[FOMC’s\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.” 

**Highlights**

* Shares of embattled EV-company Nikola (NKLA) sank further after the company said its head of fuel-cell development departed from the company. 
* An index tracking U.S. mortgage applications slid for a fifth straight week last week as mortgage rates climbed higher. Mortgage applications fell by 5.1% week-on-week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.

* JPMorgan may eventually move all its European operations from London following Brexit, according to multiple reports.

* Nio said Wednesday its 100,000th mass-produced vehicle rolled out of the production line. It has taken Nio a little less than three years fro mthe rollout of their first vehicle to reach this milestone

Using your picture, its high point was the peak of COVID-era speculation. Other companies that got beaten down at the same time have recovered and hit new highs. ROOT lost 50% (!!!) and continues to languish.

This is because it's a newly-public and speculative company that the market doesn't know how to value yet. The technicals you're trying to play (double bottom, using previous peak as a price target, etc), don't even begin to solidify until the company has a years-long established trend of growth and profitability.

What are your thoughts on this company from the U.K. who are reimagining vehicle production methodologies whilst delivering EV niche for Commercial vehicles. In case you haven't seen any of their marketing material. 

Their main selling point is low capital microfactories that can be stood up in desired locations with little effort and limited space unlike traditional car manufacturing conveyor belt type traditional approach. I personally think this is a good approach to scaling and adapting to local needs. 

In their presentations they have referred to scaling to large number of factories over the next coming years and the strong revenue growth as a result. This may be optimistic but if they have the recipe to replicate then this will bring about a new standard in automotive manufacturing.

[Arrival presentation](https://arrival-site-cms.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/39573881-229c-4bae-927b-969002d4a01b_Arrival_Investor_Presentation.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj87oa39dfvAhUR76QKHV8ZA9YQFjAAegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2fJ-FC1aSNL0MUJ4JrLw5m)

They have been working with UPS to design delivery vehicles and have said they have UPS order of over $1B - no doubt there are clauses attached to this and other orders Arrival speak of.

Also I'm sure they will benefit by the Infrastructure plan recently touted by Biden.

mn0e7l,gtv0v4h,stocks,comment,1617918740,"I like the concept of distributed energy; I like the concept of distributed factories. I just don’t know that the business model works?

“There are more than 560 cities in the world [that] have a population of over 1 million people, and each of these cities could have a microfactory producing 10,000 vehicles specifically tailored for the needs of that market,” Sverdlov said.

Who owns (or will own) each Microfactory? Does/will Arrival own them? Or does the local interest — say, the local transit authority — own them? I’m not sure I exactly understand the business model, selling end vehicles from these 560 microfactories, or licensing the technology (microfactory technology, vehicle technology, etc.) to whomever owns these factories? Or a combination of all of the above? 

It seems an interesting concept and model and makes sense, but does it make cents? I don’t know. I worry that at this point you/I would be investing in the micro factory business model rather than the EV tech?

I have to say, in summary, I’m fingers crossed they do great, ... but not investing my money on them, not even an Hail Mary invest some play money-type move 🤷‍♂️",

mmcfar,,stocks,post,1617830866,"U.S. Market Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021**Dow +0.05%, S&P 500 +0.15%, Nasdaq (0.07%), Russell 2000 (1.60%)**

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities were little changed in quiet Wednesday trading. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq were narrowly mixed while Russell 2000 was under pressure. Sectors mixed. Communications services, tech, energy best performers. Materials worst performer on chemicals weakness. Industrials a laggard with most sub-groups on the defensive. Treasuries mixed with curve steepening after yields fell to lowest level in nearly two weeks. Dollar little changed vs euro and yen. Gold finished down 0.1%. WTI crude settled up 0.7%.
   * Market once again devoid of meaningful directional drivers. Recent focus has been on reopening momentum, the moving pieces surrounding infrastructure stimulus, the debate about the market's ability to withstand a higher rate backdrop and rotations. FOMC minutes this afternoon seemed to be a non-event and Q1 earnings season increasingly seen as the next big macro catalyst. Street looking for nearly 25% growth in S&P earnings with upside risk stemming from the usual suspects and green shoots, supply constraints, input cost pressures, pricing power and wallet share shifts likely to be big conference call themes.
   * **FOMC minutes** reiterated Fed mantra it will be some time before substantial further progress is made on goals. Still an outsized focus on **infrastructure stimulus**, particularly in terms of taxes. **Yellen said White House plan tilts scales in favor of companies that invest in US** in WSJ op-ed. Commerce Secretary Raimondo said there is **room to compromise on White House proposal to raise corporate tax rate to 28%.** Politico reported **corporate America doesn't like infrastructure plan given tax changes**. JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said **US economic boom could easily extend into 2023**. Sell-side firms continue to highlight **economic reopening momentum**.
   * Not much corporate news. Cruiseline names **CCL**, **RCL** and **NCLH** helped by CDC reopening comments. **RPM** beat but also discussed significant input price inflation ahead. **LW** missed and flagged supply chain disruptions but did note positive impacts from easing coronavirus restrictions. **MSM** revenue a bit below though commentary was upbeat. **BB** boosted by QNX win at Volvo. **SGH** beat and guided above. **SCHN** beat on strong metals demand and ASP tailwind. **MAXN** guided below on supply chain pressures. **GEO** suspended quarterly dividend payments.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Growth groups ahead with communication services, tech the leaders:**
      * Growth groups extended the week's outperformance against value. **Communication services** the leader as internet names led. **Tech** ahead with upside from AAPL and services, though semis didn't do much. **Energy** an outperformer as integrated oil, E&Ps recouped some of yesterday's declines. **Financials** ahead with moneycenter banks, pockets of insurance among the better groups. **Consumer discretionary** an underperformer with homebuilders, auto complex weaker. **Consumer staples** lower on weakness across food, discount retailers. **Healthcare** trailed on weakness across biotech, life sciences, and hospitals. **Industrials** an underperformer as A&D and airlines traded lower. **Materials** the worst performer on weakness across chemicals.
   * **No surprises from March FOMC minutes:**
      * The [minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210317.pdf) of the FOMC's March 16-17 meeting (which saw no policy changes) broke very little new ground and did little to illustrate any large divide within the committee or anything notable about the timing of removing any accommodation. Participants were upbeat on the accelerating economic recovery and better Covid vaccine and case trends, though some voiced concerns that highly accommodative financial conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking and building financial imbalances. Members generally anticipated nearer-term inflationary pressures would be transitory, though there was also some attention to rising market-based inflation measures. Participants agreed that the economy remained far from the Fed's longer-run goals and that current guidance for rates and asset purchases was serving the economy well. A number emphasized the importance of clear communications well in advance of any policy moves.
   * **Infrastructure stimulus headlines continue to shift toward taxes:**
      * Taxes continue to get the bulk of the attention when it comes to infrastructure stimulus given implications for both reconciliation and earnings. Fed Chair Yellen said in a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-corporate-tax-for-america-11617813355?mod=hp_opin_pos_1) op-ed today that the White House tax plan will tilt scales in favor of companies that invest in the US, boost competitiveness of US business and help end global race to the bottom. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/06/corporate-america-biden-infrastructure-plan-479490) earlier discussed how despite its longstanding call for infrastructure spending, corporate America does not like the White House plan. Highlighted worries about raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% without restoring deductions scrapped in the 2017 overhaul. Global minimum tax flagged as potentially the biggest area of concern. However, Commerce Secretary Raimondo today suggested there is room to compromise White House plan to raise corporate tax rate to 28% ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-taxes/commerce-chief-raimondo-says-there-is-room-for-compromise-on-biden-tax-proposal-idUSKBN2BU2P9)).
   * **Fedspeak includes more commentary on patient stance amid pandemic recovery:**
      * **Chicago Fed President Evans** (voter) said the Fed's employment target will be in sight before too long, achieving the inflation goal will be more difficult ([speech](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2021/promising-outlook-opportunity-community-colleges)); the bar for reducing asset purchases won't be met for a long time. **Dallas' Kaplan** (non-voter) said the Fed would not act as pre-emptively on inflation as it has in the past, but he doesn't want the Fed to fall behind the curve on policy. Kaplan also earlier told [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-says-the-economy-still-needs-central-bank-support-11617787800) the economy still currently needs Fed support, but it will be healthier accommodation is removed as the economy recovers. **Richmond's Barkin** (voter) said evidence of inflation pressures are starting to build, and supply chin constrains are now the biggest economic risk. **San Francisco's Daly** (voter) said bold policy steps would help limit COVID scarring, and that the Fed balance sheet is far from hitting any limits ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-daly/feds-balance-sheet-size-is-far-from-hitting-any-constraints-daly-idUSKBN2BU2XG)). **Fed Governor Brainard** said on CNBC the outlook has brightened though reiterated remaining slack and that inflation impulse is likely temporary.

mnd5wm,gtx0nzj,investing,comment,1617965947,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are mixed this morning. Tech stocks appear to be taking a breather a day after rallying 1%. Nasdaq down about 0.1%. Small caps (Russell 2000) and Dow are up about 0.2%. S&P 500 showing a small gain. That’s as of 0645.

There is one item of interest on the economic calendar today: The Producer Price Index, or PPIs, at 0830. Expectations are for a 0.5% increase in the price of goods sold by manufacturers. A number that overshoots will bring the inevitable concerns about inflation. Bonds are being sold off a bit this morning, probably in anticipation of this. Ten-year yields are up to 1.671%.

Other than that it should make for another quiet day on Wall Street. Maybe an opportunity for companies or others to release some unwelcome news, perhaps late the afternoon? Wouldn’t be the first time.

so I was looking to Invest into the Universal Music Group spin off hopefully later this year.

Tencent recently bought 20% of the Company at a 30 Billion Valuation, so Vivendi decided in February to Spin Off 60% of Universal Music Group to Investors. I assume the offering price for the company will be around 30 bln as well since the Tencent purchase only happened recently.

As far as I understand they will distribute Shares of UMG to Vivendi Shareholders via a special asset dividend. It is also mentioned, that they will List the Stock onto the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

Does this mean, that I have to own Vivendi Shares in order to receive Universal Stocks at IPO or will I also be able to buy them directly on the Stock Exchange on IPO Day without owning Vivendi Stock?

The current valuation of $10B dwarfs the $4B it was valued at in a private funding round in 2020, and at approximately $1B more than Beyond Meat. This is despite the fact that BYND brought in 400M in FY revenue compared to Impossible Meat's 150M estimated annual revenue.

I personally don't see any angle from which $10B can be justified. Future growth for the next decade is priced in at the current valuation and it strikes me as a massive bust waiting to happen.",

This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.  


Edit update:
Open options interest for this week are trending 100% bullish sentiment

Today they announced a new marshmallow snack for grab and go has station type purchases.    Marshmallow is one of the highest profit margins of any food products.

mmywpw,gtuooxo,investing,comment,1617913374,"I don't have much of an opinion on the stock price - I know it's taken a beating over the last few years, so there could be value here. I do want to provide some info on the company as a whole though (or at least how things have been going in Canada with them).

KHC's legacy products have been taking a beating as far as market share goes. Maxwell House, Kraft Peanut Butter, Salad Dressings, Kraft Dinner, Heinz Ketchup, Cracker Barrel (which they sold off), even things like Classico and Philly - they're all declining in share.

There are a couple reasons I can see:

* The cost structures are all out of whack. The cost on these vs. competitors, or even the store brand is at least 25-30% higher, and sometimes as much as double. As such, they are priced accordingly, and customers are starting to shift away.

* Some of these categories are shifting towards being commodity, others are moving premium. Cheese and Peanut butter and moving toward being a commodity, whereas Coffee and condiments are going the premium route. People are shifting from Max to higher quality coffees. And Kraft BBQ sauce is just... awful, especially relative to something like Sweet Baby Rays. Kraft is struggling to adjust with the times here.

* They already own so much share, there isn't a ton of room to grow. At one point, they owned 85% of the peanut butter market and 90% of the ketchup one. That's been steadily eroding and I don't see it slowing down anytime soon. And I don't see them getting back to 80-90% in any category. They need to expand outside of the core.

* Retailers hate working with them. Part of it is the cost structure incentivizing us to go elsewhere, but there's also this air of superiority there. While most vendors consider retailers to be their partners, we've had meetings with KHC where they have said, verbatim, ""you need us more than we need you."" That would be a powerful statement if it was completely true. Some brands yes, others we could delist tomorrow and see no impact.

I could see them turning things around if they start going the premium route - they kind of started doing this with the Classico lineup, but they could definitely do so with Coffee and Condiments. They could also look to acquire a smaller on trend brand and grow them out, like what General Mills did with Annies, or what Campbells did with Kettle Chips. They can't keep beating their existing brands to death though, they need to innovate their way out of this long term.","['GIS', 'KHC']"

mn8840,,investing,post,1617937608,"JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground)

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",['JPM']

mn9mjt,,investing,post,1617942867,"[DD] Bull or Bear: Nano X Imaging (NNOX)General disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

---

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**
---

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

I would have a price target of NNOX at $50 (for the risk adverse) - $100 (if you truly believe).","['WAT', 'GOOGL']"

mn9mjt,gtxbw14,investing,comment,1617973082,">$40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX

This seems extremely expensive in the PACS/RIS space.

edit:
So, for folks who haven't worked in this industry, here's a normal radiology workflow:

1. Your doctor orders a study be done.
1. Scheduling dept creates a work order/appointment in their RIS (radiology information system). This is usually integrated into the HIS (hospital information system) of the Hospital that the DR is affiliated to/has admitting privileges to.
1. Patient shows up for their xray, so they get checked in on the RIS. 
1. Rad tech pulls up the work order on the RIS, preps the patient, and takes photos with the ""modality"" - what people in the industry call things like XRay machines, CT scanners, Ultrasound machines, nuke med machines, and so on. This is basically the ""camera takes photos"" portion. The modality is the camera. They produce photos that can either be printed to film (in the old days) or more likely get digitally transferred into a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System). This company makes cameras, basically. They don't make the photos, they don't make the photo album.
1. The study shows up for the radiologist to read in the PACS. They read it and dictate their findings in the PACS.
1. The dictation shows up in a worklist for a transcriptionist to transcribe into the medical record in the PACS or RIS.
1. The radiologist checks and approves the transcription in the PACS.
1. The study is made available to the requesting doctor with the findings, and the patient gets appropriate treatment.

So out of this entire multistep workflow, this company only seems to make the camera portion. This portion is not usually done as an ""as a service"" since these are huge $6-$8 figure machines, that can require tens of thousands to millions to even get installed. 

Support contracts may be based off of quantity of studies performed, but they're not charging 35% of dang price of every single study. That's absurd. There'd be no incentive to move away from plate + film printing since it would cost more in fees than it would in film doing things ""the old fashioned way"".

That makes me think they're trying to bundle in PACS functionality, but that's absolutely not a good thing. PACS systems are how you store the photos, and retrieve them for viewing, dictating readings, etc.

PACS systems often charge ingestion/storage/viewing fees to access the studies. But even then the pricing is absurd. The PACS system I personally ran charged a few dollars per study, scaling depending on the type (tiny nuke med studies were cheaper than massive mammo studies or gigantic multislice CT scans). XRays are near the low end of the requirements scale. They're just singular pictures, and there's usually only a handful of them. They aren't a ""hot ticket"", which would price them above the competition. 

So, maybe they're relying on the PACS to be *""that good""* - then you've got the issue with PACS/HIS/RIS systems being extremely sticky, and hospitals likely have one already. That means a huge burden to switch.

The medical arena has made it a standard of not having standards. This means any time you attempt to change something, you have to hire specialists called HL7 Programmers to re-implement the gateway systems that translate information between all of these disparate systems and standards. Yes - they made a standard out of the translation system between the standards, rather than implementing a single standard.

The overhead is so massive that many PACS/HIS/RIS vendors will literally give away the modalities and supporting ecosystems to entice customers to switch, figuring they can make it up on support contracts. Modalities like the one this company is making.

There's a massive moat here.

mn2id1,,investing,post,1617918815,"$Hear DD - Brief write-up on a company I think is posed for a good amount of growth in the years to comeHello Everyone,

&#x200B;

We all know that gaming is growing and that it will be a good market to be in for the long term.  According to Grand View Research [The Video Game Market is Projected to grow at 12.9% CAGR from 2020-2027 and the Streaming market will have a CAGR of 20.4% over the same time period](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-gaming-market-size-worth-7-24-billion-by-2027--cagr-48-2-grand-view-research-inc-301220945.html#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Market%20%E2%80%93%20The%20global,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027). also, the [Gaming Headset market is projected to have a 7.5% CAGR from 2020-2026](https://www.wboc.com/story/43596299/gaming-headset-market-2021-is-estimated-to-clock-a-modest-cagr-of-75nbspduring-the-forecast-period-2021-2026-with-top-countries-data)  I am sure that there are other projections which are more than this and that there are others that there are less. However, I would argue even if the numbers are 10% instead of 12.9%, 17% instead of 20.4% and 6% instead of 7.5% that you would want to jump into this industry as it is going to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

Now a little background on [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)

&#x200B;

Turtle Beach was originally founded in the 1970s and their main goal was making sound software/hardware for musicians. In 2005, however, they decided to use their experience in engineering sound to create headsets for gamers and that has been what they have focused on since.  If you want more info on their history you can go [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Beach_Corporation)

&#x200B;

Now Turtle beach is  known for their gaming headsets - they have nearly half the market share in gaming headsets per their last earnings call [You can see the earnings call transcript here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411642-turtle-beach-corporation-hear-ceo-juergen-stark-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) in addition to this, however, they also own [Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/) and [Neat Microphones](https://www.neatmic.com/)

&#x200B;

So now that we have a little background on Turtle beach, I will give you the reasons that I think they are set up perfectly to capture this growing market and to grow in the years to come.

&#x200B;

The Financials:

[Yahoo finance financials for HEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEAR/financials/)

&#x200B;

2 things really stick out for me for Turtle beach when you compare them to the other companies in the industry: 1. their balance sheet and 2. their cost of revenue

If you look at the balance sheet you will see the have an objectively great balance sheet.  $167 in Current assets  - $47 million of which is Cash on hand and $78 Million in Current liabilities - almost all of which is short term payable and accrued expenses. The bottom line is **the company has $47 million in cash and $0 in debt**.  They also have a great gross profit - coming in at about 37% of revenue. which when compared to companies in their industry like Corsair who has a 27% gross profit %.

&#x200B;

Now is where I think people really miss out on Turtle Beach, everyone thinks they are still just a headset company, primarily for consoles - obviously their ticker  doesn't help this image, but they are expanding their foothold into the Computer parts and microphones aggressively.  Per the last earnings call: "" We will continue to expand our PC  gaming portfolio of headsets, keyboards, and mice. The additional  ROCCAT PC products we launched in the fall last year will be followed by  another wave of really exciting new PC gaming products this year. As  I've mentioned, our near-term goal is to create an incremental $100  million business in PC accessories and our longer-term goal is to lead  those PC gaming categories."" How do we know this is really what they are doing and not just simply something said to make investors happy? well if you go to Turtle Beach's website and look at the [Careers Page](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/careers/) you will see that one of the jobs is director of brand marketing - Roccat. This along with the news today that [Roccat just snagged a deal with LCS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turtle-beachs-roccat-pc-brand-123000929.html) tells me they will continue to grow this brand.

In addition to this Turtle beach is still being valued as a gaming headset company.  Look at their PE ratio - it's only 12.19 as of closing today.  Compare that to other players in the sector - Corsair at roughly 27, Logitech at roughly 20 and razer who doesn't turn a profit last I checked.  A PE of 12 for a company with no debt in an industry that will continue to grow is an amazing prospect - however their current valuation makes sense if you think they are simply making headsets which will have moderate growth in the years to come verses PC accessories.

I do want to mention some quick risks to Turtle beach as I think there are some which could very much derail the company:

1. My whole case for Turtle beach depends on them growing Roccat and Neat Microphone - either of these could fail and if that is the case they will have trouble growing at a good pace - compare this to the branding that Corsair, logitech, and Razer already have, and you have a company that should be trading at a lower PE ratio
2. Similar to above, they are a very concentrated company and the majority of their sales do come from headsets, that industry will not grow at an alarmingly fast rate, so that will stifle their growth if it cannot be addressed.
3. While the amount of cash they have for their company size is incredibly good, it is not an amazing amount of cash compared to companies like Logitech, who , if I did my math correctly, [has 1.3 Billion in cash on hand, enough to buyout Turtle Beach at their current market value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/balance-sheet?p=LOGI).
4. Following the above, In this industry moats are hard to find, while this is a good thing for the growth of Roccat, it is a dangerous thing for the Turtle Beach headsets
5. Finally, due to the company size, one or two poor moves could really derail the company, so that is something to keep in mind.

Overall I am very bullish on the company, this is not my most in depth DD (time has been tight to do a good write up), but I think I brought up most of my bull points.

Positions: Currently 46 @ an Average cost of 25.57.  I will continue to add more shares though throughout the year as I believe this company is undervalued and in a great position to grow.

mn4cq4,,investing,post,1617924396,"Hedging the Hedgefundie (UPRO & TMF)So I've been considering using a significant amount of my portfolio towards implementing Hedgefundie's 55/45 strategy: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007

&nbsp;

Basically, it is a buy and hold strategy where 3x leveraged S&P 500 UPRO and 3x leveraged 20-year bonds TMF are held 55 to 45 percent, but if we use options to hedge, you could change this allocation to favor UPRO more than TMF (70/30, 75/25, or even 100 UPRO)

&nbsp;

Right off the bat, there's a few concerns with this strategy. First, it is very volatile and depends on the SPY continuing to move steadily up. Many folks are speculating we're in a bubble that is bound to burst somewhat soon. 

&nbsp;

By far the biggest issue with this strategy is that a large drawdown in SPY could absolutely tank UPRO given that it is 3x leveraged. Last March, the fund went from ~$80 to ~$20 in just a couple of weeks, and only reached $80 again in January of this year.

&nbsp;

The inherent hedge of this strategy is in TMF as bonds are often negatively correlated to equities. During the same crash last year, TMF shot up from ~$31 to ~$47, and stayed above $40 for a good portion of the year.

&nbsp;

However, bonds increasing when the SPY decreases isn't a guarantee, so why wouldn't we hedge further by buying some puts on UPRO and TMF ~10% OTM dated a year or so out? This is particularly compelling with Volatility at a low-point at the moment. Puts at this price range for this far out would cost quite a bit, roughly 10% of total investment, but would limit max loss in the event of a major downturn to cost of puts + how far OTM the puts are (20% total).

&nbsp;

Should such a downturn occur, there's a couple things that could happen:

1) UPRO crashes, TMF goes up: in this case the gains from TMF will partially offset the losses in UPRO and you could exercise your put on UPRO and reinvest back in when the market starts to recover.

2) UPRO and TMF both crash: In this case you could exercise the puts and reinvest during the recovery. In the worst case scenario that the market doesn't recover (bear market) you would exercise your puts  and realize a 20% loss from initial investment.

&nbsp;

Given the potential returns of UPRO, it seems likely that it would be capable of generating some impressive returns, particularly if stock market is able to continue the bull-party for the rest of the year. Given the optimism around re-opening and the Fed's dovish monetary policy, this is a definite possibility. And if the market really does break? You could certainly do worse than 20% loss.

I'm sure I'm missing something about this, so before committing to this plan I was hoping to get some opinions. 

Thanks!

EDIT: The major concern I think with this, is the high cost of buying the puts. You would need for UPRO to gain 10% to break even on the puts within the next 288 days (for a Jan 21, 2022 expiration). Of course, this could possibly be mitigated a bit by selling covered calls on UPRO.",['SPGI']

mminfh,,investing,post,1617851206,"LARK seems like a good buyThis small regional bank has some nice things going for it. They’ve consistantly grown their business over the years. They’ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which won’t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition. It was one thing that worried me and caused me to email their investor relations, but fidelity just has a bad newsfeed because the company is so small.",

The only thing that I don't like here is they keep issuing more shares, not crazy but slowly, which is normal for a micro-cap company. However, I stumbled down a post they started buying back their shares last year.

Based on its TTM Cashflow statement, they just bought $2,000,000 worth of shares.

I love a stock when they consider buying back their shares, imagine for a micro-cap company, because it's definitely a good sign that they value their shareholders. I love this practice from companies that are publicly traded.

I think I have enough signals to start a <1% position in my portfolio and just watch. I'll be cost-average if they're doing great. I think there's upside potential on this stock and have room to grow from acquisitions but I'm buying from its current cash flow at the moment.

I'm just an average FP&A guy, not a superstar by any means... but what immediately stuck out to me in two seconds of looking at their financials is that the industry's Loan Loss Provision is 2.5 times that of LARK's, and on a micro cap, one small wave of defaults could put this company immediately underwater.

Consider that when BOA acquired Countrywide they discovered that a full third of Countrywide's loans were in default.  Countrywide's acquisition price was 2000 times larger than LARK's market cap.

I've got 20 years of experience in financial and data analytics, and even I don't feel confident in my valuation of banks because once you start getting into Level 2 and Level 3 assets, the valuations are so complicated that even some folks at Goldman couldn't tell you with accuracy what the bank is worth.

Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it’s not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn’t expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week’s 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

mm65gx,gtqacmj,investing,comment,1617827158,"Really interesting passage here from Dimon w.r.t post 2008 banking regulation and it's impact on loans:

> To understand this in more specific terms, look at the chart above that shows, prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had $13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending (this is, in part, directly related to the new liquidity requirements) may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experienced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more had been lent, the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been faster. 

I haven't heard this brought up before but it's something worth considering.

Also regarding QE and deficit spending:

> If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quantitative easing (QE) and deficit spending averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period after the Great Recession did not result in higher GDP growth and possibly higher inflation. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 4%, which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%.

> And so why did all this QE not have the effect you would have thought? QE was never effectively tried prior to the Great Recession, and it is different from fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securities from security holders who tend to reinvest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset prices and creates some spending (through the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may have some inflationary effects, mostly on asset prices. But on the other hand, it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves, which is an input cost for businesses, and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement income). And finally, in this most recent round of QE, much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back as deposits at the Fed, not as loans.

Just in case anyone needed another explanation of why we aren't seeing massive amounts of inflation. 

In general there's a ton of good stuff in there, the COVID-19 section in particular regarding possible scenarios going forward, risks and some insight into the kind of acute liquidity events that cropped up last year and why we might be seeing them more frequently.",
mm65gx,gtpj41v,investing,comment,1617815487,"I know that coming from Jamie Dimon, who heads one of the largest global banks, calling for increased regulation for fintech sounds pretty self-interested. But I kind of feel like he is right. We've already seen, over and over, what kind of damage banks can do when we leave them to their own devices--and that is with regulation. But an increasing amount of systemic risk is now taking place outside of those regulations.

Take a recent topic of a lot of discussion: Coinbase. As of their December reporting, they had over 90B of customer assets, which would have put them in the top 40 banks. I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

mm9ppe,,investing,post,1617823242,"Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sourcesBy Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.","['MS', 'AES', 'XOM']"

mmg62o,,investing,post,1617842616,"$BAOS - Baosheng Media - Recent IPO Play Extremely Undervalued and Primed to Make Moves in 2021**Background:**

Baosheng Media Group is a Chinese Online Marketing solution provider. It's main business model is connecting advertisers to online media. Managing marketing activities, advertising strategies, budgets, and ad optimization services.

**Growth:**

Baosheng Media Group has been steadily growing revenues seeing year over year increases from 2018 to 2019 of 10.5% from $16.16 million to $17.85 million. Securing long term contracts with many media moguls such as: Tiktok, Amazon, Ctrip, 360 finance and Youku.

**Future Growth:**

$BAOS ipo'ed in early February 2021, offering 6 million shares at a IPO price of $5 a share. Raising $30 million in proceeds which will be used for expanding the Company's business scale and building its network of leaders/acquiring employees.

China's digital marketing spending is rapidly growing, with 2021 forecasts expected to increase 20% from 2020. With expected annual growth of above 20% as companies are looking to more short-form video ads and social media ads.

$BAOS is looking to capitalize on this growth by utilizing funds to enter into new sections such as NFT marketing and into the crypto currency field. BAOS received backing and a $10million investment from Ebang $EBON in late March to develop a blockchain-based platform/NFT and crypto currency platform.

BAOS is looking to create a platform to buy and sell NFT related work and enter an exploding market. NFT's market cap grew 1785% from 2020 in early 2021 due to the NFT craze. With China leading the market in dollar volume and spending.

**Margins and Ratios: (competitor valuations)**

BAOS is a market leader when it comes to profitability and margins.

BAOS reported 9.5m and 11.16m in pretax income in 2018 and 2019.

Those are margins of 58.7% and 62.5% respectively for their years.

Return on equity: 43.2% vs market average of 4.78%

Return on assets: 13.27% vs market average of 1.27%

Their bottom line has been steadily improving year over year through developing efficiencies and capitalizing on market trends.

**BAOS:**

Market Cap: 172M

Revenue: 17.8M

Earnings per share of 0.4

Price to earnings of: 14.72

Net profit: 10.8M

Cash on Hand: 51M

**SRAX:**

Market Cap:115M

Earnings per share of (0.69)

Price to earnings: N/A

Revenues: 8.6M

Net Loss: (14.6M)

Cash on Hand:9M

**IZEA:**

Market Cap: 270M

Revenue: 18.3M

Earnings per share of (0.248)

Net Loss: (10.2M)

Cash on hand: 33M

**Comparatives;**

As you can see BAOS is deeply undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few small cap marketing companies that are operating at a profit (62.5%) at that aswell. It also has the strongest balance sheet and cash balance among its peers.

**Cash Position:**

BAOS is flush with cash and there is no threat of any share dilutions/offerings. BAOS is sitting on over 51 million in cash. Broken out by 11Million in cash pre IPO, 30Million from IPO proceeds and another 10 million received from EBON.

BAOS is cash flow positive with cash from operations each year in excess of 9M annually, further increasing its cash position.

BAOS will be looking to utilize this cash to grow its business through acquisitions, new infrastructure such as NFT platforms and acquiring talented individuals.

**Public Float:**

Baos has one of the smaller active tradeable floats on the market. The initial offering only issued 6 million shares of BAOS with many of these shares being locked up until August.

The stock is largely unknown with volumes being very scarce. This is causing significant bid/ask spreads upwards of 3-4%. This also means there is very few walls for when this gains momentum.

**China Low Float Recent IPO Trend**

Chinese low float stocks have been getting pumped across the markets lately. Many of which have been recent IPO's due to their share lock up periods further reducing the floats.

Some prime examples include:

$EEIQ running form $3.58 to $35.20 in 2 days

$UTME running from $4 to $107 in 2 days

$WAFU running from $4 to $21 in 2 days.

$BAOS meets all the above criteria, with a small float, small market cap and in a hot sector. NFT/Crypto

**Upcoming Press Releases:**

I am expecting a press release to be issued in the next week or two regarding the demo/roll out of their NFT platform.

BAOS's first press release was issued on March 18th regarding the EBON collaboration and entry into the NFT field. This was the first day the company could release news due to its 40day quiet period after a IPO. EBON stated in early February it was looking to enter the NFT field. I expect the partnership was entered in early to mid February. Meaning a news release on the development of the platform for BAOS should be right around the corner.

NFT press releases have cause stocks to skyrocket, and was the hottest sector in March. With stocks such as TKAT, HOFV, DLPN and WKEY gaining as much as 1000%. These stocks have cooled off but most are still trading at 2.5-5x their pre press release values.

The market has cooled off since March but I do expect a large movement the day the PR comes out due to the thin walls and small public float.

**Summary/Price target**

BAOS is a unknown hidden gem. The cash obtained through IPO and Ebon investment will help it improve/expand its infrastructure and significantly grow the business. BAOS is already experiencing over 10% annual growth and these numbers will explode in 2021 thanks to China's online marketing spending growth of 20% + in 2021 combined with BAOS entering into the NFT market which grew 1785% from 2020. BAOS is sitting on over 51m in cash and there is no risk of share offerings due to its cash flow from operations exceeding 9m a year. BAOS is a market leader when it comes to cost minimization and profit margins, experiencing over 62% margins in 2019. BAOS is unknown to many and is not getting the traction is deserves, the first press release will send this flying thanks to its bid/ask spread and being in the NFT sector. BAOS is undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few profitable marketing small cap companies and is sitting on a boat load of cash.

PT Short Term (May): 10$ after the press release relating to the release of its NFT platform. This would make it the similar market cap as IZEA, while BAOS has substantially more cash and is reporting 11m in net income vs Izea's 10M losses.

PT Long Term 2022: $25

I expect revenues to climb 30% + in 2021 thanks to China market growth and entering new NFT fields combined with purchasing/acquiring new infrastructure and talent. BAOS is still being valued as a marketing company (undervalued) and has not capture any of the NFT/Crypto attention.

EDIT: This post is getting some backlash because this subreddit is anti-chinese plays. I am not advocating to toss 100% of your portfolio on this stock. Allocate a small portion and diversify your holdings. This stock is trading at its IPO price and has limited downside thanks to its cash position. Enter with a small portion and set a stop loss to test the waters. This stock is unknown due to the lack of PR's as it just got out of its quiet period. The upcoming PR about its NFT platform will attract new investors and make this rally. Feel free to sell at a gain once it does so or set a stop loss at your initial investment price and ride it out. Dismissing all Chinese investments is a awful investment strategy.

Even if I wanted to be risky. Why would I go in first? Better to let some other sucker get killed and buy the dip. That's what I did with Luckin. Picked it up after it tanked 97.5% over a 20-40% sales inflation. That's when you see if it dies or not. If not, then you do some serious DD before you make a move. Have you ever even used BAOS' product/service or spoke to someone who has? I think the answer would be no.

Yeah. And many more have been dumped or been outright robs. There's no shortage of IPOs, SPACs, new bloc-chain things, and sketchy Chinese offerings.

p.s. It's fine if you make this kind of post if you're honest about it being a trade on the speculative pump and dump. Just don't post it on r/investing and take it to r/WSB.

The goal of printing money is to balance demand by encouraging entrepreneurs to make more stuff. 

The end has an excellent explanation for what led to the inflation of the late '70s-'80s. Basically, oil prices went up, production costs increased, and demand for cash increased from businesses to meet their needs until oil prices went down again. The money supply does not make prices go up or down on its own.

Added bonus of an older article, it's fun to see that people were saying the same things in 2011 that they're saying now and we're able to see the results of those predictions 10 years on.

mmivok,,investing,post,1617852005,"New Position: Atlas Air WorldwideMy portfolio has a lot of technology and stocks that have performed well. As some of these stocks get near their all time highs again, I've been cutting down my exposure to some of them because some of them had grown to a large % of my portfolio (a good problem to have). As a result, I've built up some cash and have been looking for cheaper names of beaten down companies outside of technology. One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. 

\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. 

**Company Profile:**

The company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: 

ACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. 

Charter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. 

**2020 Financial Highlights:**

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith & Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. 

Right now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.","['BLK', 'AMZN']"

mlzyon,,investing,post,1617794893,"Investing: the future winners among car manufacturers and your opinionGreetings! I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

**VW** has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, [Frank Walliser](https://presskit.porsche.de/motorsport/en/mediaguide-2017/topic/gt-programs/porsche-gt-team/info/driver/dr-frank-steffen-walliser-porsche-gt-team-wec-gt-2017.html), at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

|COMPANY|COUNTRY|P/E RATE|RETURN SO FAR 2021|RETURN 1 YEAR|MARKET VALUE (BILLION USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Toyota Motor Corp**|JPN|10|4 %|39 %|249|
|**Bayerische Motoren Werke AG**|GER|9|16 %|120 %|65|
|**Porsche Automobil**|GER|7|67 %|203 %|35|

* VW is a solid bet but they're probably riding higher on hype right now so I'm waiting to see if the price settles a bit lower before making a move.

* BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, etc. are luxury brands that aren't going anywhere but also aren't likely to be major movers in the transition. Their value is tied more to their brand than market share so I'm not particularly interested in them right now. Probably safe but not super exciting.

* I picked up shares of Ford because they're a major manufacturer and because of their stake in Rivian. Admittedly they're moving a bit slow on EVs compared to others but their share price is still low compared to others so it's a safer bet to see short term gains.

Also, some of the penalties they had to pay for DieselGate went towards developing EV charging stations (which can now help their EV sales.  Oh no, such punishment...)

Their bread and butter EV model, the Rav4-sized ID4, will be manufactured on *3 continents* and sold all over the globe.  They have a partnership with QS, with intentions to produce *solid state batteries in 4-5 years*, which could be a significant jump on the competition.

Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming a new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are regulated.

Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

“Crypto is at a mainstream inflection point,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Paradigm and Coinbase’s former president. “It’s in its very early stages and, much like the internet (once was), it’s very fragile while it’s in that stage.”

The internet emerged as a major force in global commerce in part because of a handful of key policy decisions, including those that legalized data encryption and resolved questions over sales taxes, Mr. Ehrsam said. The nascent cryptocurrency market is sure to face its own crossroads, even if it isn’t yet obvious what they are, he said.

“It’s challenging because policy makers want to balance risk and reward, and even people who spend time in this space would struggle to predict where this will go in the coming decade,” he said. “It was very hard to say where the internet was going to go.”

The council plans to appoint a board that would include representatives with each of the four initial members. In time, Mr. Ehrsam said, the group will add an executive team.

Mr. Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang founded Paradigm three years ago to invest in both cryptocurrencies and the companies that focus on that market.

Fidelity, an investing colossus with nearly $10 trillion in client assets under administration, opened in 2018 a custody business that stores and trades bitcoin for hedge funds and other professional investors. Last month, the Boston firm became the latest money manager to seek regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.

Square, an electronic-payments company, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. And the firm’s Cash App consumer-finance platform allows users to buy and sell the digital currency.

Coinbase, founded in 2012, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. The company, which serves 43 million customers in 100 countries, plans to go public later this month.",

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

>  
>  
**Verified Users of 56 million**  
Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) of 6.1 million  
Assets on Platform of $223 billion, representing 11.3% asset market share

**Total Revenue of approximately $1.8 billion**  
**Net Income of approximately $730 million to $800 million**  
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Crazy.

Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

All else being equal there are reasons to believe the excess liquidity sloshing around the system will find its way to risk assets, specifically stocks, before too long. First quarter earnings could change that, but that will be the story for next week.",['CCL']

I need advice and some serious talk.

I am currently sitting on a portfolio of

\- 45% ETF´s  
\- 40% high dividend stocks and reits and such

rest in individual stocks I picked and liked.

I want more growth as I want to reduce the time I need to get to a certain threshold.

I picked the dividend stocks mainly because of the high yield. the lowest yield I get is 4,5%. highest at 13,4%.

I know that

\- those high yields are probably not lasting forever

\- I miss out on growth of the actual securities

but also , ALL dividend securities are green since I bought them.

the lowest being +1,51% (OMF), the highest being 42,88% (OKE).  
the rest is between 8,7% 27,09% green.

what should I do ? sell at green, take the tax hit (which is about 25% of profits where I live -> germany)  
or keep those titles ?

currently I reinvest every dividend payout I get. but those also take a tax hit. so I am missing out on returns and not even benefitting from the full dividend payout...

I am open for all kinds of tips and suggestions.",['OKE']
mljfdc,,investing,post,1617736729,"S&P 500 Flirts With Record, But 'Overbought' Jitters Keep Lid on GainsThe S&P 500 continued to trade near record highs Tuesday, led by energy and consumer stocks, but some on Wall Street are calling for caution as the latest acceleration pushed stocks into ""overbought"" territory.    

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% after hitting a record high of 4,086.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14%, or 46 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.

""Watch the S&P 500 over the next few days for potential consolidation - that benchmark is now very overbought / extended on the short-term trading charts and is likely to see some profit taking ahead in our opinion,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. Initial support is touted in the 3975-to-4000 zone, the firm added.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

""Although we expect near-term volatility as 1Q earnings start on April 14, reflecting weak loan growth, margin pressure, lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonal factors, we remain positive on the bank group,"" Wedbush said.

Technology stocks, were roughly unchanged, with the fab 5 trading mixed, even as falling U.S. bond yields supported investor sentiment on longer-duration growth stocks.  

The U.S. 10-year slipped below 1.7% quote yields after trading in range of 1.67% to 1.72% in recent days. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was higher.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) struggled to get going after racking up a 6% gain on Monday, as investors digested a bearish note from Roth Capital.

Roth Capital said Tesla is only worth $150 a share and suggested the electric automaker was a ""minor player"" in the U.S. and European markets.","['NDAQ', 'FB', 'STT', 'GOOGL', 'DOW', 'PNC', 'MSFT', 'DVN', 'AMZN', 'BK', 'FANG', 'APA', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'TSLA']"

mkzjy4,gtisvs8,investing,comment,1617672980,"I think you're comparing apples to oranges here in a sense. 

First, Real Estate is not a liquid asset like your stocks.  It's something you put into a (likely) minimum 5-10yr time-frame with regards to financial analysis. 

Secondly, you own the entire thing. This is not shares in a company that you have no control over. Your DD on buying a property should be way higher than DD on a stock. You should know the neighborhood and know the risks and be willing to take them.  You should be fiddling with pro-formas constantly to decide if a property works for you. If it doesn't then don't do it.  Also, people forget while there is an advantage to leverage, YOU can decide how much you leverage. If you want to have a 50% leverage to feel safer and have a better cash-flow, then you can. Nothing stops you from doing that. 

RE is a great hedge against inflation. Your cost for money stays static mostly, while inflation goes up and so do your rents and so does the value of your asset. In the same vein you're taking tax breaks on deflation and other expenses. 

Of course your stocks won't call you at 3am on a weeknight letting you know that the water heater has exploded in the garage :) 

Lastly, all your ""what ifs"" apply equally if not more to any stock. What if there's a global pandemic and my airline holdings can't fly anyone. Would you have predicted no one would be watching movies in theaters for 9-12 months? There is inherent risk in any investment, but with RE you're more likely to have a long-term glacial change than rapid fluctuation.",

Weird thing about property, one of the only times banks will loan big money to average Joe.  Real estate makes more millionaires then any industry.  It’s because people can get leverage easily.  The house is collateral.  It’s rare a property drops to $0 or even 50% quickly.  But like any investment, requires you to do your homework.

Don’t buy a cheap single family home in a questionable town that’s supports the coal industry in bumblefuck nowhere with multiple fracking sites within a couple miles.  Then act surprised the town is becoming vacant or there is pollution in the ground water.

Do buy a duplex in a town undergoing gentrification.  It sounds like a joke, but look for where new Micro Breweries are going up.  It’s the trendy shit that puts your town on the map.  You use to look for new McDonald’s or similar franchise growth in small town.  Today it’s micro brews and ChikFilA.  Bonus points if you’re handy or have a construction background.

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",['AMP']

My 30-something daughter is just now starting to invest as she has advanced in her career and is making good money. Well, I think she got her first lesson in investing: Don't believe the hype. She bought FPWM at $4-something. Just 100 shares so it wasn't a lot of money, thankfully. I have no idea where she got that ""tip"". I took a look at it but didn't say a word. What was I going to say? That she bought a stock that had hardly been over .60 per share in 5 years for over $4? She talked to me a few times about how much it was going up and she was really pleased. I put it on my watch list just to see what it did.

Well, it got up to $8 per share and then bam... dropped like a rock. The volume that day was WAY above it's average. It's now under $3.

On the brighter side, she did put $5k into VTSAX.",

Yes, it caps your profits. Yes you’ll miss a short squeeze. 

But if you are comfortable being long at $26, and happy with $8-9 max upside, why not dive in?

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought of NFTs on hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at only fans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style& apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming & lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty & Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style & apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming & Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty & Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast)

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['CHD', 'CVS', 'WMT', 'GPS', 'NKE']"

March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed  - now completely digital.  No more glossy centerfolds.

It also appears that the adults now own & run the business, Hugh Hefner died in 2017 and his daughter who ran the company from 1988 to 2009 are no longer an issue.  It is also apparent that most of the losing enterprises from Heff's day have been dropped.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises’ had merged with Mountain Crest - a SPAC.  


According to Schwab:     
Canaccord Genuity Initiates PLBY Group at Buy Rating With $28 Price Target

Craig-Hallum raises price target to $35 from $25

Roth Capital raises PLBY Group's Price Target to $26 From $18, Keeps Buy Rating

Also up 19% yesterday and 4% After hours.  

If I were to buy into PLBY would have to see what their Asian operations & casino openings slated for the next 3 years are.  And what the former Asian operations financials were before they closed them down.    


As to their brand/product - to be crass the product is a commodity.   Not sure if it has any cache anymore.  As to hawking other brands: "" Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. "".  Every company that can,  works with (pays extortionate rates for) celebrities which is a tried-and true way of doing business.  Also pretty tired method.   If you need a reminder of celebrity abuse and how useless it is: doughy-faced Tom Bosley of Happy Days TV show fame gave a rousing recommendation for a swindlers failed investment scheme. 

*On buying sentiment:*   
PLBY has a former reputation to live down, using celebrities to pitch their brand (at very best neutral rating),  their product is barely distinguishable from other brands,  and ""Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals \[like 50% of the population - women\] – ..... I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women"" - this could be insurmountable.   


Seeing the Penthouse Magazine in its' heyday and what it is now and comparing it to PLBY is kind of the flightplan I see for PLBY.  Went from being misogynistic and vapid to totally vapid.  


***In total - good OP analysis of the positive points but PLBY has some serious perception drawbacks.***  


Think PLBY is a sell for the immediate future not a buy particularly given the runup yesterday and last night.  PLBY is still in their first year of a shakedown cruise  trying to see what works with todays clients.   More distance will have to be put between the past and what they are currently going to do to make money.  Also only time will tell if their new clients gained during the pandemic are sticky or flaky (Jesus that has unintended under/overtones).  The cache of going to a Playboy mansion is dead.  Celebrity endorsement is a big bucket of who cares.  But in 5 years - with a considerable amount of re-branding, some outstanding PR, and dropping of certain lines of business - they could make a go of it.    


But then again, I could be hopelessly out of date.  PLBY could be a total surprise.  For me, it is a pass since it has ""faddish and transitory"" stamped in big letters all over it.  Rather like cigarette stocks; except cigarette stocks pay a dividend.  Maybe PLBY is more of a day trade or swing trade.  Definitely not a buy and hold for me.  


***To the OP: good analysis of the positive side of PLBY.  Think you could very successfully write their promotional material for them.  Look forward to seeing your next DD analysis.  If this post is any indicator you are good at this.***",['BEN']

**NIO** - Known as the ""Tesla of China"" it moves exactly as Tesla does and is looking to trade in the Open Market for China as well as the US, basically a Baby tesla

**FUNKO** - now hear me out, with their recent acquisition of an NFT, i can easily see Funko moving into more of a crypto and long term growth play with a possibility of being bought out by Disney, they have also grown tremendously in the last couple of months

**Coinbase** - IPOing through a directly listing on April 30th, this is kind of an obvious play. They make a SHIT ton of money and are the King broker in Crypto and the most mainstream with their revenue growing from half a million in 2019 to 1.1 Billion in 2020

**RKT** - The biggest mortgage company in the US, expanding into Canada and looking for a fintech category, they are extremely well positioned to start acquiring other companies and start dipping their toes into other sector of the financial market (car loans, Zillow/Redfin Competitors, etc)

**Roblox** - This is strictly here because they are the amazon of gaming. People are able to make money off of Roblox and that makes it a great growth company, really any company that you can make money off of is suitable for huge growth not to mention their insane money spending crowd of kids

**Disney** - hear me out. Expansion coming for disneyland to build two more parks. Their Disney+ series is only going to get better with more marvel and star wars original content and anyone that is a parent knows how good Disney+ is. Also, once everything opens up they will be making money off theaters + their new movie releases on Disney+ to watch from home. I think they have plenty of growth left.

**Apple** - But apple i already the most valuable company how can they possible be considered a *growth* company at these high valuations. Two words for you ""apple car"" and ""Apple glasses""

**Tesla** - for obvious reasons, self driving, insurance for that self driving, more cars, EV charging expansion, all that good stuff

**RIOT** - literally the only reason this is up here is if you think Bitcoin is going to go higher then so is RIOT. in one year it went from $0.70 to highs of $75.....yup, its trading right now at under $50 i think and can easily hit $100+ as long as BTC keeps moving upwards

mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",['TSLA']

mkga30,gth6xb2,investing,comment,1617645022,"Using a throwaway account, mainly because I'm embarrassed at how little I know, and also because some personal details.

I have a large sum to invest (partly inheritance) ie around 0.5m . I have some experience of investing, but not a lot, and the recent increase in my portfolio means there's now a lot more to lose.

I don't really need the money as income (have other sources), so what I want to do is invest it for long term (30 years or so) and may not touch it before I die, and pass it on. 

I would like to grow it as much as possible, and of course not lose it.

So my thinking is index funds. I have to accept that I am not educated enough in finance, and probably not smart enough to get sufficiently educated, to be able to do successful stock picking, much as I would like to. I also don't trust a third party to manage the money fairly or well (not saying my lack of trust is justified, just that I have it).

So then the question is - which index funds?

Although people often suggest that index investing is a simple activity, I would have thought it matters greatly which index you pick.

So my questions are:

- Should I pick an S&P 500 index, even though the P/E ratio looks very much on the high side?

- Should I pick something like the British FTSE 100, which is thought to be undervalued at the moment? And then maybe come back to S&P 500 later?

- Should I choose an emerging markets ETF?

- Or stay in cash until S&P 500 cools down a bit?


I would certainly want to get more than inflation, and more than bonds would give me. I'm happy to sit through ups and downs, I just feel like the decision I make at this point is going to have long-reaching ramifications on my final portfolio.

It seems that Biden doesn't support full-fledged federal legalization. He seems more interested in federal decriminalization and let the states decide what to do for now. If that is the case, these vertically integrated multistate operators (MSOs) will have get a bigger and bigger market share as time goes on. The sooner federal legalization happens, the sooner they can lose market share to opposition (Canadian companies, big tobacco, etc). But because weed is federally illegal, they can't be listed on the NYSE. Being an OTC stock means less hedge funds and big whales invested in these highly profitable companies. Federal legalization can lead the way for them to up-list. Hopefully seeing a boost. 

So I'm bullish because I don't think we'll see federal legalization in the next year, maybe two. It'll let these companies expand. 

As for Curaleaf, they recently saw their bump because of NY legalizing weed. As well as Green Thumb, Cresco, and many other northeast operators.

mjwo8q,,investing,post,1617544552,"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policiesThe waste industry is more than just hard-working gentlemen and women collecting trash from your home or business. It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth.

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['NOV', 'GOOGL']"

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

mijlje,,investing,post,1617367458,"U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.",

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

Wanted to post this as a specific thread, but I don't have the Karma :(. If someone is interested and has enough fake internet currency, please do.","['CMI', 'DOW']"

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k).

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality.

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

We’re selling our home for $600,000 cash in the next few months. We’ll be moving into our rental property temporarily for 1-2 years, while waiting for the housing market to tank, before buying property and building a new home. We want that money to make money over the next couple of years but we also cant risk losing it as we’ll need all of it as the down payment for building our next home.

We are 37yo & 41yo w/2 young kids and live well off of just my husband’s salary. After the sale of our home, the only debt we’ll have is the mortgage on our rental property (that we’ll be moving into) and we’ll walk away w/$250k cash.

We also have $30k in savings, and my husband’s salary, less living expenses, will net us $3k/mo while living in our rental home... so we won’t need this money for any reason. 

Aside from owning real estate, we’re very new to investing and don’t know where to begin.

disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",
mj2qmk,gt9lulr,investing,comment,1617472924,"I'm not an expert by any means, but maybe I can help you examine this in some more detail because on the surface this does look interesting.

Most of my gold mining knowledge (which is not much) comes from my time working as a land surveyor [in Colorado gold country.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B047'33.2%22N+105%C2%B031'33.3%22W/@39.792556,-105.5281017,700m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d39.7925558!4d-105.5259125) All those piles of brown from there all the way south and west beyond Idaho Springs are tailings, and there's still gold up in them there mountains. From what I understand, this stuff is exactly what this company would be targeting for processing, but currently the tailings in CO are just being sat on until gold reaches a threshold price where the owner will then start processing the tailings at a profit. I don't know what that threshold is but it hasn't happened yet and there hasn't been activity here since the early 1980s.

So my questions, and these are intended to dig a little deeper, maybe think about things from a different angle and stress test your bullish hypothesis, I'm not trying to shit on your DD or anything: 

1.  Are they purely a tailings-processing company now or do they also operate traditional mines? Looks like purely tailings now, but you also mentioned looking at surface mining internationally in the future.
2. What are their current reserves? Do they have enough tailings in SA to keep them busy at current levels until 2023? 2025? 2030? Their plan seems to be focused on SA until 2026 so I'm trying to get at the scale of revenue and earnings growth for the next 5 years here. Basically if they stay in SA the jump they saw in 2020 may plateau once they hit full operating capacity until they scale up internationally.
3. Specifically related to gold tailings, are the tailings in South Africa more concentrated? Or is DRD's process more cost-effective than traditional processing and allows them to profitably process tailings at a lower price of gold? If their process is significantly and demonstrably more cost-effective then that could be a big disruptive factor for the company. If it's just that the tailings in SA are better quality, then I'm more skeptical.
4. What was the investment required to build the processing plant? And if they expand internationally, will they have to build plants locally, work with local companies (sort of leasing their process), or ship the tailings to their SA plant?
5. Has processing platinum tailings begun? If so when did it begin or if not when is it expected to begin?
6. If platinum isn't up and running, there's more risk inherent there in that case. What is the difference between gold tailings and platinum tailings? Is it a similar process (using the same methods and chemicals) or is it significantly different? Can we expect similar margins from this as the gold?
7. What's their competition here? What other companies are in the gold/platinum tailings processing space?

I don't expect you'd have all the answers to these questions, but maybe there's some things there to think about.

In short, I'm intrigued. If their processing is indeed more cost-effective than traditional tailings processing, then long term that's potentially a good sign for big growth and big scaling. That would mean a potential disruptive factor within that industry and would provide a good competitive moat/advantage. If the jump is simply related to getting a plant up and running and processing high-quality trailings, then I'd expect the growth to stabilize once platinum is up and running (if it's not already) and they'd be more vulnerable to competition especially once they start trying to scale internationally.",

I did this for my amusement, it's not investment advice.

For some ETFs that saw a huge dip, e.g. ARKK or ARKW, the computed target was close to the historical maximum, so I wonder how much price bias is there in the target price published by analysts (i.e., analysists try to reason current price, rather than coming up with a proper valuation).

I'm going to track this for a while to see how useful this information is.

Edit 1: I explained here how I computed the table: https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mijk9h/i_computed_the_weighted_average_upside_for_100/gt563uy. tl;dr:  ETF's upside is computed from the allocation weighted upside of the individual stocks comprising the ETF.

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs).

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

>New York Attorney General Letitia James' office says it found that Tether sometimes held no reserves to back its cryptocurrency's dollar peg. It said that, from mid-2017, the company had no access to banking and misled clients about liquidity issues.

>In a 2019 filing, the attorney general's office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether's cash reserves to Bitfinex.

>”Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,"" James said in a statement Tuesday.

>”Tether's claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,"" she added.

>”These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.""

**What is tether?**

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

https://assets-bwbx-io.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irp9oaPu51XM/v0/-1x-1.png

**What happens now?**

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

Tether will soon face a quarterly report, filed with the AG, may shed more light on how exactly Tether’s money is invested.

People only use tether because it’s the cheapest option for getting  1 dollar US outside of the US. We don’t need it here for obvious reasons. But if Tether crashed people would move into other stable coins USDC and DAI. But there are other complications with that such as supply.

But efforts are underway to transition to a low-carbon economy and therefore a 2 deg C increase. How much is the investment needed? Around 190 trillion (Edit: 90 trillion) USD by 2030!!

In other words, there are *opportunities* in transition to a green economy, and one that has been enshrined in pledges both by public and private institutions. New energy generation, energy efficiency technology, sustainable practices, increase in carbon price and changing customer demands.

A very obvious one: carbon price. It is expected that carbon price needs to be at around 100 USD/eCO2MT in order to achieve the 2 deg transition. What is the current carbon price now? In Europe (the highest) it is only \~37 EUR! And yet the targeted emission reduction in the next few decades already mandates that there be 7% increase in carbon price per annum!

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

* ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.
* ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.
* HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia
* KRBN: tracks the carbon future price of the European Emission Trading Scheme and that in California. The best performing commodity in 2020, and arguably in the years to come. Unlike other commodities, the fundamental case is quite strong.

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people. The thing with the USD is the inflation is pretty predictable, and prices relatively stay the same throughout the years. But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent.

mi3bt3,,investing,post,1617306304,"Micron Soars On Chip Shortage ""Perfect Storm""In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving

mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

> SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m   

Debt and accumulated equity deficit are not the same thing. Debt of a company is the total liabilities. Which in the case of SUNW is only $18M, mostly short term operational debt. Their long term liability is only a few million.  

The -$88m is their total accumulated equity deficit since inception. Not money they owe.  

> SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020. 

This appears to be because they generate most of their revenue from commercial solar projects, not residential installs.  Smaller number of large scale project, which is how they generate almost $40M in revenue from 500 installs.

In general, with a focus on commercial I’m not surprised they took a revenue hit. But they ended 2020 with $39M in the bank. Added another $49M through a stock issue. They don’t have a cash problem.  

And last year they lost $15M, $4 of which was Goodwill and $3M in one time legal fees and bad debt. Nothing unusual here.

It is still over valued IMO but there is nothing wrong with their balance sheet and they have plenty of working capital. They have a lot of cash and they appear to be using it to acquire smaller solar companies.",['MMM']

I have been seeing, for the past few months, a lot of news regarding the Turkish lira and how it lost so much value and how Turkey's economy is in shambles, etc. Not only that but Erdogan doesn't make things easier and might very well take the country to total economic collapse.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision? As far as I see it, because the lira devalued so much, it would be much cheaper for someone holding other currencies.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

Horizon 10-15 years

20K to begin with, topping at least 1K per month.
 
I read a couple of books on investing over the weekend and came to the conclusion that with my (lack of) knowledge of the markets my best bet is to go for maximally diversified portfolio,  and put it all into shares for now, to (hopefully!) gain some momentum to begin with. I’d be also inclined to tilt it a little towards growth and tech for the coming year.
 
So I’m thinking:
 
75%  Vanguard FTSE All-world (VWRP =  VT in the US) TER 0.25%

15%  Nasdaq 100 (=QQQ) TER 0.30%

10%  S&P SmallCap 600 TER 0.375%
 
I’m not sure what to think of the overlap between Nasdaq and All-World. It adds exposure to that sector of course, but it tech has done so well over the past 5 years…
 
One alternative would be to keep it super simple and just go for All-World. There’s also a cheaper All-World option on my platform, although it hasn’t done as well as the Vanguard one.

I have AAPL (7 shares), AMZN (.13 shares), TSLA (.6 shares), DIS (2 shares), CCIV (31 shares), CMG (.13 shares), COST (.64 shares), VYNE (12 shares), RWT (20 shares), VHT (.5 shares), VNQ (5 shares), VOO (.2 shares)., ARKK (1.4 shares), THNQ (2.15 shares), BOTZ (.6 shares), ARKQ (.29 shares) and ARKX (2 shares).

My goal was to continue buying fractional shares each pay check in Amazon, Tesla, Costco and Chipotle so I can slowly accumulate more equity over time, but I'm beginning to wonder if it makes more sense to just sell my fractional shares and re-allocate those investments into VOO and ARKK. I do like holding single stocks of Apple and Disney and since they aren't quite as high in cost I've been able to buy whole shares which is nice. I guess I'm not sure if trying to obtain a single share of Amazon over time is even worth it, or if I'd see a greater return putting $3k into VOO. I do plan to eventually get rid of VYNE, I bought that on a whim and am in the red but I've been waiting for it to bounce up.

So I guess I'm just looking for general feedback on whether it would make sense to continue beefing up my standings in some of these stocks over time or if I'd be better suited to just put those dollars into indexes and ETFs for the most part?","['CMG', 'AMZN', 'ARKK', 'DIS', 'AAPL', 'TSLA']"

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

**What is Zedge?**

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

mhaez0,gsxqvf2,investing,comment,1617212160,"This may sound hand-wavey, and I suppose it is, but something doesn't smell good to me. The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up.

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

mh4gbw,,investing,post,1617191640,"My take on Gold's longterm outlookFrom a technical perspective, gold is in a 10 year long c[up and handle](https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1617190625002.png) pattern, and it could go sideways for many more years until a breakout target of about 2900 is met. The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",

mh1zc3,gswgjxp,investing,comment,1617186949,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['NDAQ', 'SPGI', 'ADP', 'DOW']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

The etf is up 20% for now. 
That's higher than the usual return you get on such an etf.

What's best practice in such a case? 

1.) Realize the gains and reinvest 

2.) Realize the whole fund and wait for the (inevitable?!) correction to re-invest at a lower point

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

I know that time in the market beats timing the market, but can't imagine that one should let such an opportunity slip (especially as it is a very young investment).

mgwrdt,,investing,post,1617159948,"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market. It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys. Stuff like WDI Corp, which runs restaurant chains:  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3068:JP

Edit 2: The model has settled down- now 2000-2500 a day in late April. That's still state of emergency level, but regular state of emergency level, such as closing restaurants early. Maybe better to just wait this out and buy the dip.",['GOOGL']

1. ALNPY - All nippon airways adr. No options but you wanna bet might as well go big if you think travel will take a hit
2. EWJ - if you just want a market level bet.

Let me know when you place the trade. As someone living in Tokyo, I'll happily take the other side of your trade. 

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

mnflaa,,StockMarket,post,1617969402,"Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

This post is not mine, I borrowed/re-shared from [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/) because I found it helpful, and wanted to share with other newer investors like myself!

&#x200B;

**Original post:**

A  lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when  considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this  guide together on the things I look at. I updated my post from 2 months  ago, to include links, and expand on some points.

(Before we begin, I do want  to take a quick moment to mention, that ETFs are the safer route (than  ""stock picking"") due to diversification. But, any  newer investors should consider ETFs before ""picking stocks"". Some some  ETF's I own are: $MGC for MegaCap, $IVV for S&P 500, $QQQ for  NASDAQ, $VGT for Tech, $VOT for MidCap, $VBK for SmallCap, $ARK for  Innovation. With that being said, anyone who wants to do some  ""educated""/ ""researched"" gambling, keep reading.

There  points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock,  and where I get them from.  At  the end of the day, this is your money, and noone cares more about it  than you do. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my  preference. Everyone's ""recipe"" is different. Find what works for you!

&#x200B;

* **Know the company.**  I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do  they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their  products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

&#x200B;

* **Growth**.  I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news,  10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future  growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will  the company scale?

&#x200B;

* **Financial health**.  Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash  flows from operations positive? How are Investing & Financing  Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is  the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income  Statement Trend, etc.

1. *ChartMill.com*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/fundamental-analysis](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/fundamental-analysis)

&#x200B;

* **Earnings & revenue history.**  Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the  projections. Have they missed earnings? Have they beat earnings? Has  earnings remained flat or grew consistently?

1. *GuruFocus.com*: [https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/AAPL](https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/AAPL)
2. *BarChart.com:* [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/income-statement/annual](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/income-statement/annual)

&#x200B;

* **Valuations**.  How is this valuated? (PEG ratio, P/E ratio). Is it undervalued? How  does the valuations compare to peers or competitors in the industry?

1. *Validea*: [https://www.validea.com/guru-analysis/aapl](https://www.validea.com/guru-analysis/aapl)
2. *GuruFocus*: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/dcf](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/dcf)

&#x200B;

* **Price upside/ targets & Analysts rating consensus**.  I am curious about what the analysts covering a stock think it's worth.  I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the  price targets.

1. *TipRanks:* [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast)
2. *ChartMill*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings)

&#x200B;

* **Charts Analysis and the technical indicators**.  I am curious about what the charts have to say about momentum, and what  prior prices and charting have to say about price prediction. I try to  read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can  predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? I  look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.

2. *ChartMill.com*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/technical-analysis](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/technical-analysis)

&#x200B;

* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:**  I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the  company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign

&#x200B;

* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?

&#x200B;

* **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock? Then is so, research why. This might be reasons to be weary.

1. *BarChart.com*: [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/put-call-ratios)

&#x200B;

* **Peers & competition, and competitive landscape**.  How does this company stack up against its competitors and peers? How  do the financials compare? How to the products compare? Is there a moat?

&#x200B;

* **Institutional Sponsorship.** Are big banks and wall street holding this? How much or this company's stock do they hold?

1. *GuruFocus.com*: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/ownership](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/ownership)
2. *TipRanks*: [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/hedge-funds](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/hedge-funds)

* **Insider Trading**. Is the CEO buying or selling shares? Is management buying or selling shares?

1. *ChartMill.com:* [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/ownership](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/ownership)

* How many **ETFs** that hold this stock? Will they continue to buy it up and drive price?

&#x200B;

* **Recent News**.  I Google the company and look at recent articles. What are people  saying? What are bloggers saying? What is the news saying? Any new news?  Bad news? Good News? Reasons for movement in recent stock price?

mnbdyy,gtwk9yh,StockMarket,comment,1617950758,Saving to read in the morning,
mnh2gk,,StockMarket,post,1617974503,A book or any topic which was relevant 50+ years ago and is still relevant today would likely remain relevant for another 50 years. I feel the same exact way about Warren's advice on winning the stock market game from 36 years ago. It doesn't take a genius.,
mnflql,,StockMarket,post,1617969449,"Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days)These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

mn01d5,,StockMarket,post,1617911745,"7 Things You Need To Know Right Now That May Impact Your Portfolio (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More) **In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

mn01d5,gtuoona,StockMarket,comment,1617913370,"I agree with most of this.

It's not enough to fantasize that the FED will raise rates if inflation gets over 2%, they've been very clear; they're not even going to look at doing that before the fall, and they're not going to raise rates while the recovery remains uneven. As long as unemployment is still inflated in the bottom quartile, rates will be near 0. No amount of hand-waving will make this policy more conservative.

Powell pointed out that the unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. This is the number that matters, not the 6%.

If you look at the Greed and Fear index over time you can see it has very little predictive value, it oscillates rapidly from top to bottom all the time. [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/)",

mn07dp,,StockMarket,post,1617912211,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 8, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 8, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

My first thought is that he is selling at a high and then using insider options to buy back his shares at an extreme discount. 

Whats going on here exactly?

Also shouldn't a company insider be building up his stake in the company if Alector plans to release good data in the second half of this year?

Since the small time frame we area usually looking at is still in descending triangle formation, with bias to break to the downside.

That's why we are going to examine the daily time frame to see, why the break of the bespoke triangle to the downside isn't anything trend changing.

From a first look at the daily a familiar pattern can be spotted. It's a falling wedge bullish formation. It's a corrective formation, at which's end the uptrend will be restored.

We expect this formation bottom to be located at 50 daily EMA, at where the price is actually located.

Judging from a history, a strong dip below $7.40, daily 50 EMA can happen. This dip will result in a 10% dip that can reach $6.70 levels, a supply zone. After the price tests the supply zone an insignificant uptrend will be active.

Maybe indicators can tell us more.

RSI is slightly above 40, a break below it will result in overall bearish momentum being active throughout the days. Yet RSI is in a spot, where as long as the price doesn't drop below $5, a bullish divergence is active. 

Even currently RSI is pointing towards an exaggerated bullish divergence!

MACD is still in a corrective wave, not a selling one. The difference is that the people are just taking profits rather than selling for a fundamental reason or etc.

And of course the EMA's are pointing towards a daily uptrend. This is why our bias is mostly bullish the daily bias stays bullish.",

This is a super duper low float play. Went from 14 to 24 on less then 14 million in volume.  36 million float. Institutions and insiders own about \~37% of the float.  The public controls the rest.  We can collectively push this as high as we would like. Share and spread the word.

For the quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 2.7% year over year to $172.7 million, driven by strength in the healthcare segment. Adjusted for one-time items, net income widened 93% to $10.6 million, which translated to an 80% jump in earnings per share (EPS) to $0.09.

Shares plunged 19.6% the following day. The fact that the results were preliminary and that management didn't issue revenue or earnings guidance probably helped drive the market's negative reaction. ""Both these things add to uncertainty -- and the market hates uncertainty,"" as I wrote in my earnings article. 

Some investors also might have been concerned that the slight Q4 adjusted EPS -- by just $0.01 -- missed the Wall Street expectation, though it seems unlikely that was a noble factor. In addition, general market dynamics probably played at least a minor role. During the time the company reported, investors were rotating out of highly valued so-called growth stocks, particularly those in the technology realm, because of concerns about heating up inflation. 

Despite its more recent pullback, 3D Systems stock is still up 174% this year through March 19. The S&P 500 has returned 4.6% over this period.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from the company's Q4 earnings call that investors should know.

mn1f4y,,StockMarket,post,1617915655,"Question: Stocks on 2 different exchanges how are the prices related?Edit: I found the answer to my question somewhere else it’s posted at the bottom.

So I tried asking on r/stocks but I don’t think I worded my question correctly so I’m trying again.

If there is a stock listed on 2 different exchanges, in this case I’m looking at RNSFF and ROE (they are both the same company), there is often a significant gap between the two of them (one was at +4% and the other was at +0%).

My question is how are the values priced between the two?

A lot of people mentioned arbitrage and arbitrageurs but I want to know, NOT taking arbitrage into account, is there some mechanism that keeps the stocks values equivalent to each other?

I’m NOT talking about arbitrage.

I’m wondering if the way the stocks are actually priced (how the system comes up with the $ amount value for the stocks) is synchronized in any way?

So does the value shown for the stock on the TSX have any correlation with the stock on the NASDAQ?

So like if the stock on the TSX goes up +5% and the stock stays the same price on the NASDAQ at +0% do the two exchanges end up averaging out the value somehow or are they completely separate systems which aren’t linked at all?

Common sense would dictate that if a share on one exchange was going for $5 and it was going for $2 on the other and both exchanges had the same number of shares then it would average out at $3.50. Maybe a bit lower if one of them is Canadian. And then at some point it would be updated to that amount on both exchanges. Is that the case though?

So do different exchanges that have listings for the same company somehow balance numbers between the two of them and talk to each other?

Right now people are telling me that without arbitrageurs there is no system in place to keep the shares equally priced.

Is that true? And they could theoretically drift apart infinitely?

Or is that false? And the two exchanges will average out the price per share based on the share price on both exchanges and the share count between the two of them?

Edit: I’m even more confused now because I tried to look it up but I found a lot of articles saying the exchanges don’t issue the shares and now I’m even more confused and apparently don’t understand how the whole thing is structured.

Edit: I found the below answer to my question on Quora.

[below text is copied]

* Trading in multiple stock exchange is allowed but the trader (company) needs to comply with the exchange rules, and cannot have the same symbol across exchanges.

What happens to the price is this, example Stock A (Symbol A1) is traded in London.
“HERE: I assume there are no over-lapping trading hours to make the explanation simpler. In actual parallel exchanges trading happens with real-time FOREX conversions for the same stock mostly occurs”.

When London Exchange Trading Hours end, the last price is then netted and transferred to Stock A (Symbol A2) say in USA, after real time FOREX Exchange and this becomes the opening price for Stock A (Symbol A2) in USA.

After the trading is ended in USA, the final bell price is then transferred to London Exchange for the next day trading session. This becomes then the opening trade value of Stock A (Symbol A1) in the London Exchange the next day.

In trading exchanges, if there is any after or before trading hours for this stock this becomes the opening stock price for the next opening exchange.

If you have an online trading platform, that can trade mostly anywhere. You have now the option on the exchange you want to trade in. I select my trading exchanges (EU, USA or Asia) based on the more stable currency (USD, EU, JPY, etc), the lowest commission fees and where there are less speculators (i.e. pump and dump).

Depending on your view, you can choose trading early (EU) or trading late (USA). The advantage of trading early allows for more trading time. The advantage of trading late is you more or less knows the early performance of the stock listed on multiple exchanges. I prefer to trade early so I can go to sleep near my timezone :-)

The answer is arbitrage. Someone will buy a stock on TSX and sell it on the NASDAQ. That will make the price equal.

The two are not connected. Exchanges don't have any control over the price of a stock. The price of a stock is just the price last paid for it. An exchange is just a place you can go to. Think of an exchange like a mall. You go to a mall to shop at stores (stocks). The mall forces the stores to be open at certain times, and the mall can shut them down if they break rules or dont pay rent, but overall the mall has no control what a store does.

Hello investors,

It's been a busy past few weeks and I finally had a chance to spend a bit of time doing some research on the markets.

Since I've already shared my opinion on the markets multiples times in the past few weeks, I thought it would be informative for the readers to provide a few data points that could potentially help piece together the puzzle.

Below are some of the charts that I've gathered through a few sources.

The idea is not to look at one or two of these and come up with premature conclusions but to understand what the data may be saying and piece it together with other data points.

**Valuation**

The so-called Buffett indicator is the corporate equities market value/GDP. It sort of serves as a P/E ratio of our country (price of all companies/earnings of the country, aka GDP). Concluding that we are in a bubble territory just by looking at this is inappropriate because our country has taken on significantly more debt than it has in the past and other macroeconomic factors have changed, which contribute to the higher ratio. **The takeaway here is that we are nearer to the top than we are to the bottom.**

📷

What's notable in this graph is that when 10-year nominal yield rose in the past, P/E ratio actually both declined and increased. For instance, in the 1960s, P/E multiple expanded when the nominal yield rose. During 1970s, P/E ratio contracted when rates rose. There is no clear relationship between the two but chances are, P/E ratio will likely to contract given a rising yield. However, when I say rising yield, I'm talking more than 500bps difference. It's probably not a good idea to make a conclusion that a rising yield certainly kills the P/E ratio. **The takeaway here is that we are likely at the bottom in the bond market cycle.**

**Bond Market**

📷

This give us an idea about how in 2020, the Fed really stepped up its bond buying program, outpacing net treasury issuance. This imbalance pushed the rates lower in 2020. In 2021, the Treasury so far has issued more than the Fed has purchased. However, this will only be a short-term imbalance and the Fed will step in to ensure the short term rates don't go crazy. As for the long-end yield, the Fed has less control over it and I believe it is more likely the 10-30yr rates will continue to rise.

📷

What has been very interesting in the rates market is its relationship to gold. Usually, the real yield is correlated with the gold price: a decline in the real yield results in higher gold price. This makes sense because if the real yield is higher, then an investor would rather buy the bond to get the yield than the gold that yields nothing. My contention is that gold will likely see a turning point in the very near future (weeks to months) and I have added gold futures to my portfolio. More on this in later memos.

**Liquidity**

📷📷

As I have mentioned before, liquidity primarily determines the magnitude of a market selloff. For there to be an intense 30-40% S&P 500 decline, liquidity is most likely be lacking in the markets. The bid-ask spread on the treasuries or the CP spreads are at their lows. **Right now, I am not worried about it at all and even if a series of hedge funds go bust and cause market turmoil, I believe that the Fed has more than reassured us that it will step in to ensure a proper market functioning.**

**Leverage**

📷

CDS indices are moderately low. These indicate the credit risks of corporations and their probability of defaults. The higher the worse. A higher CDS spread means a CDS rate is higher, which means the markets demand more yield for the company's CDS because the company is in a worse financial situation than before.

📷📷

Leverage ratios are moderately higher compared to the past.

What gives me comfort is the declining leverage in the financial sector, mostly due to the stricter regulations.

The default rate will lag the corporate credit spread because the latter is based on the market pricing, which is current and a discounting mechanism. Even though the default rates may seem to be heading higher, it will be coming down because the corporate spread is indicating it will head lower. More companies are successfully finding financings from the capital markets, preventing them from filing bankruptcy.

📷

One of the key driving factor for my thesis on a bullish market action in the coming months and years is the consumer sentiment. As you can see, both the conference board consumer confidence and michigan index show rising consumer sentiment, meaning that consumers are willing to spend more disposable income and make those purchases that will grow the economy.

📷

Lastly, I wanted to share this amazing graph of Disney+ subscriber growth rate. Its competitors took a few years to reach first 100mm subscribers and Disney+ has done it in less than a year. Part of it is luck and part of it is its incredibly high demand. Like many others, I believe DIS stock will offer a great stable return over the long run. If Netflix is valued at few hundreds of billions of dollars for 200mm subscribers, that means that Disney has an opportunity to add few hundreds of billions of dollars to its market cap by growing its users to 200mm, which seems very doable.

Remember, Disney's success at streaming is already priced in, that's why they're above their pre-pandemic price. It remains to be seen how much of that is real gains; if people stream instead of going back to theaters, they're better off than other content creators, but are their profits actually going up, or are they just holding ground? If they're holding ground, this could be their peak for years.",
mmulbl,,StockMarket,post,1617896677,"Stupid Question about Acquisitions Hey all, I have a stupid question for y'all. So I purchased shares in Supreme Cannabis (fire.to) and they just announced that they were being acquired by Canopy Growth (weed.to) for 0.01165872 of Canopy stock per 1 of Supreme as well as $0.0001 per share. Now Supreme is at .40 per share and Canopy is at 36.05. if Supreme shares go up or Canopy shares go down before the deal is finalized, does that change the purchase price?

Should I watch to make sure Canopy doesn't drop below a certain point or Supreme jump past a certain point?

I just want to figure out what is the best thing to do as I am a total noob when it comes to stocks and I've never had my stocks go through a acquisition/merger before. I have tried to post in multiple other forums but for some reason they won't let me post because reasons I guess.

In your case, you should expect the price of Supreme to be approx: $0.0001 + 0.01165872\*(price of Canopy).

$RHC.V Royal Helium is a pre-production helium company located in Saskatchewan, Canada. Holds over 400,000 hectares of helium leases, making it one of the largest helium lease holders in North America.

Has currently drilled their first 3 wells and positive preliminary well results were released on April 6th showing initial gas sample test results have returned elevated and economic levels of helium concentration from multiple formations

Here is a link to the article.

[Well testing results April 6th](https://thedeepdive.ca/royal-helium-reports-initial-testing-results-at-climax/)

Royal Helium is projected to have 12 wells drilled by the end of the year and several more wells drilled by end of 2022

RHC.V also has plans to build a helium processing plant(3 to 5 years away still)

The United States is set to become a net importer of Helium by 2022. It will have sold off its helium reserve by Q3 2021

[USA helium link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/bigthink.com/amp/helium-shortage-2638945403)

Helium is a limited resource with no adequate substitute. At the current rate of consumption, there will be no more helium left on the planet in 25 to 35 years.

[Helium endangered element - McGill University study](http://www.mcgilltribune.com/sci-tech/helium-endangered-element-261119/)

This company was trading at 62c four weeks ago and currently trading at 77c as of close April 8th 2021

How Will Helium Be Used in the Future?

Using Helium as a Power Source
One thing that physicists all over the world are trying to accomplish is effectively isolating helium and using it to produce energy. The reason behind it is because the Sun uses helium to produce energy – the amount of energy produced is huge and it is one of the most efficient, clean and reliable methods of energy production; it is known as nuclear fusion.
For nearly half a century, scientists have been trying to create nuclear energy through the fusion of helium. Unfortunately, we do not currently have the correct facilities to maintain the extremely high temperatures and pressures required. However, that doesn’t mean that it couldn’t be a possibility as a future energy source for the planet.

Applying Helium to Computing
This may seem very unusual at first, but helium is used is much more ways than just as a gas. Physicists all over the world use helium in cryogenics; helium’s boiling point is as low as -269°C, meaning that it can be used for ultra-cooling purposes.
This extremely cold helium, known as liquid helium, has been proposed to be used in the growing industry of quantum computing. With the advancement of technology, this could be one of the most popular uses for helium in the future.",['AMP']

Hovering with support around $25-$26 for a couple weeks with many ups and downs. It’s a SPAC, so people are selling it when they need the money elsewhere, and it was pumped earlier this year on speculation and high stoke from being on Mad Money. 

But it’s turning into STEM. Stem is not a SPAC, it is a proven company with 2 years ahead of business already contracted in with big companies from Amazon, Walmart, google, Home Depot, etc. 

They have contracts for revenue increasing to 100+ billion year over year. They are run by established CEOs who have run very successful and large brands previously.

This is far from technical DD, but here is a link for a meeting on the 12th, to talk more about what this company is doing.

mndad9,,StockMarket,post,1617959474,GameStop's Final Blow to the Short Sellers,
mmovgd,,StockMarket,post,1617877872,"Follow up to the news about NIO; and amusing update on Jim Cramer losing his mind.Hey again,

So after my last post about NIO's news, and the hilarity of Jim Cramer in his attempt to manipulate NIO's price - clearly trying to get NIOgang to sell - which as I mentioned in my last post in edit 2 he deleted [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721); well, now it's even weirder.

First, you all should know that NIO has more good news recently: in an interview for the ceremony NIO had commemorating their 100,000th EV produced, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin has mentioned that they man plan to be more 'aggressive and higher' in their target of 500 battery swap stations built this year; meaning they're probably planning on building more since he's saying the 500 is a conservative goal; here's the [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/08/nios-william-li-says-reaching-500-battery-swap-stations-this-year-is-conservative-goal/).

Moreover, it's also been revealed in this interview that once NIO's ET7 is out, they'll be planning on releasing another sedan that will be more competitive with Tesla's model 3; here's the [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/08/nios-william-li-says-second-sedan-will-be-launched-in-the-future-more-competitive-than-tesla-model-3/). Also, he's said that NIO will be planning on building more plans in order to meet the production capacity, and that the intelligent EV industrial park NIO's building with the Hefei municipal gov will start on April 29--big news!

So more infrastructure, more models, and more production is coming for NIO--that's great right? Absolutely yes; NIOgang loves NIO and we like the stock (GME and [u/TheRoaringKitty](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRoaringKitty/) respect)...so where does amusement come in again? That's right, Jim Cramer again! Lmfao.

Jim Cramer has effectively lost his mind in his attempt to try and cause more of a drop in NIO's price; perhaps his suit buddies weren't happy that he deleted his original bearish tweet. Well, he's now back at it; he has just put another tweet out saying that NIO isn't as good as Tesla; and why would you trust the Chinese Tesla bla bla bla; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1380078487671861248).

First off, this is stupid from Cramer. It wasn't very long ago--in January this year in fact, that he was saying NIO is the next Tesla. Here's the [link](https://www.thestreet.com/video/why-jim-cramer-thinks-nio-is-next-tesla). So it looks dumb on his part to flip-flop like this in such a short time frame--although **short** might be a reason...him and his suit friends, that is.

Secondly, those of us who've payed attention to Tesla's history, knows that Cramer is no friend of Tesla. Do you of you remember when Cramer was saying Tesla is a bad investment? Here the [link](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1380091798224134148/photo/1) to refresh your memories; Cramer actually called Tesla a ""bad company"" years ago.

I think we're simply seeing Cramers opportunism; simply flip flop when it suits him and his friends at the expense of the retail investors. What's hilarious is that NIOgang is really going after him on his twitter, some favorites include [1](https://twitter.com/InvestorJpk/status/1380092981789736961), [2](https://twitter.com/Arno_Lacompte/status/1380102779839078402), [3](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1380088296827588619)

I want to say thank you to all of you for the appreciation you showed to my last post; look I know that most of what I like to talk about is NIO--but like many of you AMC, GME, PLTR, TSLA, etc.,. apes who're passionate about your diamonds, and yes I agree, I love them too--I'm just as passionate about NIO. What's funny is that I first learned about NIO here way before I even had a reddit account.

I hate both countries governments, theirs and ours--but I love NIO, I like the stock; and I'm pretty sure GME gang, AMC gang, and NIOgang are really all family; and we stand against serial manipulators like Cramer and his suit buddies he serves.

Thanks everyone; stay long and strong.","['TWTR', 'TSLA']"

mmql64,,StockMarket,post,1617884518,"PRVB Catalyst PDUFA on July 2**PRVB** focuses on developing drugs  that can prevent life-threatening diseases. The company's leading  candidate is **PRV-031 (teplizumab**), a medicine that could delay the onset  of type-1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk patients; no such approved drug  exists at the moment. In a phase 2 clinical trial, a 14-day course of  PRV-031 delayed the onset of T1D by a median of about three years  compared to the placebo. **PDUFA** decision on **July 2** for PRV-031.

 The **diabetes market** is  huge. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), some 34.2 million Americans suffer from the illness, while 88  million have prediabetes. While some 90% to 95% of cases of diabetes are  of the type 2 variety, **PRVB** still sees a market opportunity  of more than **$1 billion** in the U.S. alone for its indication. And given  the excellent results displayed by the drug in clinical trials, it looks  very likely to earn approval.

I think there is a good chance that **PRV-031** will achieve blockbuster status. This drug's approval would also validate the **PRVB** masterplan to  develop drugs to prevent severe illnesses. The company has other  products in its pipeline, including one being investigated for the  prevention of systemic lupus erythematosus.

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume.  Any ideas on why the small price action?
Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   


This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.

(by **The Sound of Money** as seen on **Seeking Alpha** on April 7, 2021)

***Management Updates Guidance***

On March 25, 2021, Rite Aid provided updated guidance for the 2021 fiscal year that closed on February 27, 2021. In that guidance, Rite Aid indicated the following:

· Full year revenue of approximately $24 billion (on target with guidance of $23.9 - $24.2 billion provided on December 17, 2020).

· Fully year net loss of $90 to $100 million (in line with guidance of $89 - $114 million provided back on December 17, 2020)

· Full year adjusted EBITDA of $425 - $435 million representing a miss of $65 - $85 million versus the December 17, 2020 guidance.

The adjusted EBITDA miss caused RAD shares to tank more than 20% and settle below $19 per share. But was that price reaction in the stock warranted?

***Deutsche Bank Raises Price Target on RAD***

The following day on March 25, 2021, despite the blow that had been dealt to RAD shares by the market, Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Rite Aid to $27 from $17 and added the stock to its “Catalyst Call Buy Idea” list. What could be behind this vastly divergent view held by Deutsche Bank compared to that of the general consensus on Wall Street?

***The Q4 COVID Effect***

The EBITDA hit taken by Rite Aid during Q4 of the company’s 2021 fiscal year was directly related to a unique, non-repeating event, namely the explosion in spread of COVID-19 infections that took place throughout that 90-day period. The spike in USA COVID-19 cases was centered directly in Rite Aid’s Q4 which ran during the months of December 2020 to February 2021. During Rite Aid’s fiscal 4th quarter, much of the nation was on lockdown mode. Visits to retail stores were less frequent, and acute prescriptions were down. Most devastating to Rite Aid’s profitability during the quarter was the fact that precautions taken to avoid COVID-19 spread, also dramatically reduced the incidence of common cold and flu.

Rite Aid’s 4th quarter EBITDA miss is a one-off, COVID-19 related event that is now in the rearview mirror. Looking ahead, there are significant tailwinds that should bolster the company’s financial performance in the 2022 fiscal year which began on February 28, 2021.

***The Re-Opening Trade***

In addition to the updated guidance provided by Rite Aid on March 25, 2021, the company gave some insight into the start of the new fiscal year (2022) that began on February 28, 2021:

*""Looking ahead, we have seen acute prescriptions return to positive levels in March…”* – Heyward Donigan, CEO, Rite Aid

In the first quarter of the prior (2021) fiscal year, Rite Aid saw a year-over-year decline in acute prescriptions of 14.8% resulting from the postponement of outpatient medical visits and elective surgical procedures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The prior year decline in acute prescriptions contributed to a 2.6% decline in adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decline in Rite Aid’s acute prescription sales continued throughout the first half of fiscal 2021, with a drop of 4.9% in that year’s second quarter. However, with the economy re-opening, outpatient visits and elective surgical procedures have now largely returned to normalized levels, as is indicated by Rite Aid’s report of a positive trend in acute prescriptions during the first month of the new fiscal year, 2022. As a result, Rite Aid should see a significant increase in year-over-year acute prescriptions which should contribute to an increase in adjusted EBITDA during the first half of the current fiscal year. As well, with the COVID-19 lockdown now concluded in the USA, it can be reasonably expected that visits to local drug stores will increase relative to the first half of the prior year, with a broader range of products being purchased by consumers beyond just cleaning products and disinfectants. As such, front-end retail store revenues will likely see a year-over-year boost, adding further to improved adjusted EBITDA results.

***Impact of Coronavirus Vaccinations***

Another significant contributor to Rite Aid’s improvement in first half fiscal 2022 results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. Recently, the US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose. Within Rite Aid’s updated guidance announcement issued on March 25, 2021, Rite Aid CEO, Heyward Donigan remarked:

*“…we are proud to be selected as one of the retail providers administering COVID vaccines in the majority of our key states and cities, representing over 1,800 of our stores. We are significantly ramping up the number of vaccines we are administering on a daily basis, and have administered approximately 1 million COVID vaccines in March to date.”*

At the rate of vaccination indicated by this statement above, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

***Second Half of Fiscal 2022 Will See Benefits from Cold / Flu Season***

Rite Aid’s 2nd half of fiscal year 2021 saw earnings take a significant hit due to the weak cold and flu season during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. However, experts are concerned that the upcoming cold and flu season could by dramatically worse. As face-to-face interaction between people returns as a result of the end of the lockdown, there will be far greater spread in the USA of virus that cause cold and flu. Also, as a result of last season’s reduced flu level, there exists little data for utilization in the development of the upcoming seasons flu shots. With little data available to scientists, the 2021 – 2022 flu shots may not be highly effective at preventing the flu. On a relative basis, Rite Aid is likely to see much higher year-over-year revenue and profits in the second half of the fiscal 2022 (September 2021 through February 2022) related to cold and flu remedies.

***Long-Term Debt Remains a Downside Risk***

The long-term debt level remains a concern for Rite Aid. As of the Q3 earnings report, the company indicated that debt stood at $3.2 billion. The interest level required to service this debt amounts to approximately $200 million per year, which is a drag on earnings to the tune of approximately $3.65 per share. Thus far, Rite Aid has demonstrated that it is capable of servicing this debt level successfully, and it expected to report positive free cash flow for the full year fiscal 2021. However, if there is an unexpected downturn in the economy or Rite Aid’s performance, the long-term debt could put the company’s financial future in jeopardy.

***The Author’s Estimate of Rite Aid’s Fiscal 2022 Forward Guidance***

Based on the assumptions noted above, I have calculated an estimate of Rite Aid’s forward-looking guidance for the company’s fiscal year 2022. My figures for Rite Aid’s financial outlook for the current fiscal year are as follows:

**FISCAL YEAR 2022 PROJECTIONS (BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S ESTIMATES)**

**Total Revenues: $24.9B - $25.2B**

**Same Store Sales: 4.0% - 5.0%**

**Adjusted EBITDA: $590M - $620M**

**Net Gain: $6M - $31M**

**Adjusted net income per share: $2.45 - $2.85**

**Capital Expenditures: \~$225M**

**Free Cash Flow: $170M - $220M**

***Conclusion***

Rite Aid’s financial performance for fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to a reduction in acute prescriptions and low sales of cold and flu treatments. During the current fiscal year (2022), the company is likely to see a strong revenue and profit improvement as it benefits from tailwinds created by normalized demand for acute prescriptions, cold and flu remedies, and the boost provided from reimbursements for COVID-19 vaccine administration. Vaccine administration is likely to benefit Rite Aid in the long-term, providing a growing revenue and profit stream for the company.",

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the \[FOMC’s\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.”

1. $GLSI had 100% success preventing breast cancer recurrence over the last 6 years in their clinical trial 1 & trial 2.
2. Management team has 35+ years working together on several other successful biotech startups. They’re just repeating a proven biotech business model.
3. Executive team already multi-millionaires from previous successful ventures, they have not paid themselves a salary since starting $GLSI, and thus the CEO stated on video a few months ago they do NOT need to raise additional capital.
4. CEO of $GLSI bought up 75% of the shares of GLSI…high insider conviction!
5. The drug originally developed by U.S. Gov, the CEO of GLSI bought the rights to the drug from the gov under the condition that GLSI would finish it’s development through all the clinical trials. The CEO notes this on a 2020 Benzinga video presentation.
6. MD Anderson Cancer Research facility in Houston, TX has performed all of $GLSI’s clinical trails, and is performing the final trial 3 as well. (MD Anderson = world’s best cancer research facility in the world, very difficult to get MD Anderson to accept performing clinical trials on a new biotech drug. Most biotech companies don’t have this resource, $GLSI does.
7. See price jump to $158 when the 1st half of data was presented at the American Association of Cancer Research in Dec 2020, showing 100% success over last 6 years in trails 1 & 2.
8. See $GLSI C.E.O. video on Benzinga PowerHour on March 11 saying Thursday April 8, 2021 Midnight they will be releasing the 2nd half of the data (immune response data) from their American Association of Cancer Research presentation April 2021. This is the last piece of data for $GLSI to start phase III trials for FDA approval. Video is linked.
9. Notice the stock price has been significantly increasing the past few days in anticipation of this new being release April 9 evening. $150+ price estimation on Friday April 9, 2021.
10. My metrics give $GLSI a 93% probability of success for FDA approval, with a price of $400-500+ after FDA approval. Recent stock price moves show many others agree with my estimation.

During the pandemic, global healthcare systems were put under critical strain due to severe shortages of hospital beds and medical equipment. Patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, are at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a fraction of these patients will require high-level respiratory support to survive. Due to such shortages in equipment, the demand for 3D printing has increased drastically.

3D printing devices are increasingly being used to manufacture medical devices, personal protective equipment (PPE), testing devices and even emergency dwellings to isolate people suffering from the disease. 3D printing community members closely collaborated with companies and hospitals to ensure adequate manufacturing approaches and appropriate clinical use.

The global 3D printer market reached a value of nearly $8.6 billion in 2020, having increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.8% since 2015. The market is expected to grow from $8.6 billion in 2020 to $20 billion in 2025 at a rate of 19.4%. The market is then expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.4% from 2025 and reach $39 billion in 2030.  The global 3D printing market is a rapidly growing and versatile industry due to its ability to adhere to various markets, cost effectiveness, and efficiency. 3D printing helps to create parts for the manufacturing of engines in the automotive industry, produces prototypes for houses that enforce architects be more innovative, helps create lighter tools, and is inexpensive for various industries such as healthcare and construction.

ELS and SUI are incredibly similar and it's difficult to pick one or the other. UMH pays the highest yield and even though it's growing FFO/Share the payout ratio is so high that it can't grow it, maybe just keep it at the same level. If you had to pick ELS or SUI, which one would you pick? Maybe both?

mmjdhe,gtrrt97,StockMarket,comment,1617854019,"""Manufactured Homes"" are a polite way of saying ""mobile home"" or ""trailer park home"" or ""tornado magnet"" or FFT (FEMA Formaldehyde trailer).  I bet you were thinking ""pre-fab"", weren't you?

What people might not realize is that it is almost impossible for someone without collateral, in the twilight years of their life, to get a mortgage over a certain baseline amount.  The average home price has far exceeded that baseline amount and seniors, who are faced with the prospect of subsisting off of their social security, need to find *some* type of housing.  This property class is especially flexible because the elderly are willing to live where others are not (next to industrial areas and on the immediate perimeter of airports and other ""cheap land"" areas).

Trailer park communities consisting largely of seniors are starting to pop up all over the country anywhere below the rust belt.  These properties are almost considered government sponsored enterprises because their fund revenues are fueled by social security (so, if social security ever goes sideways, these funds will get destroyed).  Typically, the buyers of these ""homes"" don't even own the land on which they're parked.  When the occupants of these ""homes"" kick the bucket or become too sick to reside in them, these homes are repossessed, cleaned out and recycled to the next dying, broke boomer.

...and now the seniors are facing competition of America's working poor and illegal immigrants (remember that ""below the rust belt"" part, right?).  The combination of demographic and economic pressures make this type of property a growth sector at least for the next couple of decades.  However, given the sector's exposure to social security solvency, I feel like I should be getting at least a 5% dividend and better than 30% year on year growth.",

I am a EV Bull and been looking forward to building positions in lots of my favorites like XPEV, NGA, CCIV, FCEL, BLNK, and daddy tesla which I still need to get.

I am not a huge bull or have lots of money but was finally building my cash back from losing on last correction and got some NIO earlier this week and its crashing like wtf, I am so tired of stocks and stuff beginning to get over it and thinking of getting a house loan to make that an investment because my returns are zero to negative basically. I am down $80 on NIO itself and thinking going to just eat it but this shit just takes a huge toll on my mental and annoys me all day everyday until I am broken even again at least you know. Maybe hydrogen fuel cells are not in the immediate future or too far off right now and should be looking into lithium ion battery stocks and limiting positions only averaging in on the dips for the EV market but I am just coming on here to vent basically and be pissed off while all my other friends are making killings in crypto and I haven't made any moves in the past year",['TSLA']
mmd3wf,gtrsfav,StockMarket,comment,1617854398,Nio is being affected by the chip shortage once that is done it will moon by then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,
mmd3wf,gtqnknf,StockMarket,comment,1617833158,You’re chasing other peoples ideas and trades. You need to sit down and find a sector that is easy for you to understand & read and that’s also profitable. EV plays can be very good but I’m guessing you’re not buying in enough volume to actually make the risk reward worth it. If you’re buying and selling within a month that just shows you’re not confident in the choices you’ve already made. To me it sounds like you need to actually study more and try to actually learn how the market works.,
mmd3wf,gtqog9f,StockMarket,comment,1617833581,"NIO is very early. Look at its  1 year chart. If that sucks, I don't know what to tell you. 

Theres a chip shortage going on for the whole EV sector, 10 yr treasury rate is rising, plus we are still in a pandemic where a lot of big boys dont know where to leave their capital other than savings. 

NIO will be a few hundred in 5 years. Stock market is for investors. Gamblers generally get burned.",

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Edit2: tons of questions on the proxy. Basically it is a number given to you, by your broker to allow you voting once the link is up. I believe you won’t be able to obtain it until the 15th with some brokers, while with others you can already ask for

And GME keeps dipping to some stupid price I'm comfy with and I just buy more.Been trading several years, but only started diving into options in the last year or so.  At first I just played around with low cost stuff to get the hang of how it worked.  Then Jan rolled around and I stopped messing with it and bought GME.   Now I'm at a point I feel comfy running the wheel and have a solid idea of what I'd be doing, but every time I have a decent enough amount of cash in my account, hedgies (or whoever) do their thing and all I can see is discount tendies.

mnho9j,,wallstreetbets,post,1617976365,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter to find rising stocks! This week's top stock and its DD: Chewy ($CHWY)I had posted the previous picks from my program and my analysis here and the response I received was amazing. I have been working on improving the program and **have made the program** **public.** If you have seen the previous posts, please feel free to skip to the DD.

**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: Chewy ($CHWY)**

Week on week increase in mentions: 204%

Month on Month increase in mentions: 187%

Avg sentiment across the mentions: +32.1%

**Core Product**

Chewy is an e-commerce website where you can purchase animal supplies. The company was founded in 2011 and was acquired by PetSmart in 2017 for $3.3 Billion. The company IPO’d in 2019 ($22 per share) and the stock has seen considerable gain since then (currently trading for $81)

They have a few different product lines. One is the basic consumer products such as play toys, treats, pet food, litter, etc. Another segment is prescription medical products such as medications, vet-suggested diets, and non-prescription medical products such as supplements and medical shampoos. The company is also extremely focused on customer service even going up to the level of sending flowers to customers upon the death of a pet.

The company was trending mainly due to their Q4 earnings beat where they beat Wall Street’s expectations by a seven-point margin. Chewy has executed its Covid strategy to perfection and it's being reflected in the stock price.

**Financials**

The company’s net sales for Q4’20 grew 51% Y-o-Y to $2.04 Billion which enabled them to expand their gross margin to 27% (300 basis point improvement Y-o-Y). The company also generated its first quarter of positive net income ($21 M) in Q4’20. The company also has $563 M in cash as of Jan’21.

For the fiscal year 2020, the company’s net sales increased 47% to $7.1 Billion. One important aspect to note is that the company is still in loss of 92MM (compared to 252MM loss last year) even after a record year in growth. This can be expected of an e-commerce company growing at a breakneck pace, but the long-term value of the company depends on how well they can leverage the existing customer relationship to improve their margins.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Autoship :** This is the single most important aspect of the company's long-term success. Autoship can be considered as the company’s subscription business model and is an easy way to set up repeat deliveries for the products the customers buy regularly. This can be on any of their products from pet foods to prescription medications. (The company gives some discount to customers who set up auto-ship).

&#x200B;

[Source: investor presentation](https://preview.redd.it/7kwualpmk5s61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ea1d199dabfc65356969414b1c3c02f38af1eb)

**COVID-19 pandemic:** The pandemic has benefitted the company in multiple ways. First and foremost is the number of pets owning households has increased drastically since the pandemic began. (As per Chewy’s reports pet-owning population grew 5.6% in 2020 compared to the 5-year CAGR of just 0.6%). Adding to this, there is a general rise in the share of e-commerce as a percentage of total retail spend as more and more customers are getting familiar with buying online due to the pandemic restrictions.

**Customer service:** The company is well known for its customer service. There is a lot of mentions about customers getting flowers when their pets died, getting refunds without even specifically asking for it, and even sending hand-drawn portraits of your pet. All of this will eventually lead to customer goodwill which is important given their razor-thin margin.

Having said all this, there are definitely some risk factors for the company.

**Risk Factors**

Even though re-opening of brick-and-mortar stores won’t majorly impact Chewy’s revenue, it would be unwise not to factor in the impact physical pet stores opening up would have on the customer's one-time purchases.

Adding to this, even though with all the focus on tech, the margins Chewy is working with are razor-thin. Given the importance of customer service they give, only time would tell if the goodwill can be converted into higher margins.

Walmart, Costco, and Amazon all have abundant pet supplies. It would be hard for Chewy if an aggressive competitor undercuts the company on price. Also, more and more veterinary hospitals are tying up with online pharmacies. This allows the hospitals to directly order the medicine for the customers from these players and the customer receives the medications at their doorstep thereby cutting Chewy out of the picture.

**Conclusion**

There is certainly a lot to like about Chewy’s performance. Even though there are some risks in terms of re-opening of the economy, low margin and possible entry of bigger competitors, Chewy with its exceptional customer service, perfect execution of its pandemic strategy, and an extremely successful subscription business model put them in a strong position.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I currently do not own any stock of CHWY. Please do your own extensive research before investing in any stock.*","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'TWTR']"

https://preview.redd.it/jma78u7rq0s61.png?width=2042&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d26706464b98106347c0a0775974b12acc4cb2

I joined WSB a while back after seeing DFV's updates. I love to gamble, but have always played it safe with index funds - probably out of laziness more than anything. The GME vs hedge fund narrative got me excited and I knew I wanted to be a part of history.

So I bought 125 shares at around $60.

https://preview.redd.it/wstw0wf2s0s61.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=6836e5261d16411b6801da9981c5b28b9a080b22

Fast forward a couple of months - I've learned how options work, laughed my ass off at a lot of memes, and received a little stimmy money from the good ole US-of-A that's been burning a hole in my pocket.

So I decided to YOLO that money + some extra into $GME calls and shares.

Here's what I bought and why:

* **4 20**0c  (4/23) -- DFV's 500 12c are expiring next week, which he will probably exercise (because he's a legend). Hopefully, he posts his YOLO update before 4/23 🚀
* 2 **420**c  (7/21)-- June 9th (**6/9**) Shareholder meeting could result in a stock recall or reverse stock split 🚀
* **6 9**00c (1/21/22) -- Since we can't predict exactly when GME will moon, we might as well bet on long calls and/or hold shares 🚀
* 10 more shares at 1**69.69** \- I like the stock and 69 🚀

TLDR: Used an unsophisticated combination of 420 and 69 to buy GME calls and shares based on limited DD and retarded ape logic.",

# We're not going to fuck around today.

We are going to cut to a kind of chase that you feel deep in the party, the sort of way your heartrate RKTS when she's looking at you, her laugh her smile, she's sexy, you're sleek, she has curves in all the right places and her tophat seats 7, you're there...  the feel of that bass hits, it moves through you both so connected hip locked there is fire.  She's taking you for a ride, you cock a hammer and she nails the trigger. Nothing else matters because zoom zoom you're going to the moon...

You're so sure you are going to win you ride on over to the bar and blast off your fucking wallet in fancy drinks thinking about what the nasty done grownup is going to be like... this is the one... fuck art school girls, this chick works for a living.... she's not just flashy shes also smart...

You return, she's gone... No ones there, the music fades it tasted so good, shoulda banged on the first date but you held on... she burns you though, burns you real good, you saw something in her, something deep, something real... but she walked, deleted your number and left you holding heavy emotional baggage. But she just needed to ""find herself"", figure out who she was scraping rock bottom...  This is how you fall in love with the stripper.

But you know what fellas...

# The Canoo Paypig is back from the dead and she's about to pay out.

**The last time we spoke earnings had yet to happen.**

We theorized that Hyundai was doing crazy shit.  Canoo actually walked from the deal because they were charging hourly not for IP. That was a big mistake to not protect IP. Tony also announced cancelling guidance.  This is a big deal. Tony also announced they were going to manufacture their own vehicles which is good but no specific details. They also said they would announce a contract manufacturer to take the MPDV to market.  Reading the 10k specifically pages 38 - 39 there was material weakness from poor accounting controls. This is why the CFO got fired. Tony hired a bunch of people that have actual experience running an actual company. Tony said we are going to focus on fleet sales.  They might drop news about the contract manufacturer or about the pre-orders.

Market said get wrecked and my account went straight to zero. To be honest, Tony did the right thing for his company. In doing so and not just pumping the Hyundai deal where they were giving away their IP for pennies he also just lit my financial ambitions on fire and told me to get fucked. While I was crying into my pillow, we ran a sick ground game and found out that GOEV has a secret showroom in Fort worth where we snapped this [pic](https://i.redd.it/lqal7z93f8r61.jpg) of Canoo Chad Truk in the wild. My brother actually walked in there and talked to some of the people while they were having a party

**The biggest deal about that is its unreported in the media.  For all the shorts know Tony hasn't said or done shit.  Setting up a showroom close to the Texas Motor Speedway and close to an airport where executives can fly in for the day and check it out and fly out seems real fucking smart.**

# Here is where I want you Apes to start paying attention to numbers because this is real important.

[Monday March 29th - Day of Earnings](https://u.teknik.io/4ifj2.png)

**SP - H -12.54 L - 11.65 C - 11.8**

**SI is 19.7 Million Shares**

**Average  price of shares short is 15.5 (Avg $ SI**) - This will be approximate

It is important to understand where the shorts are in regards to an average price.  Until the shorts are underwater is highly unlikely that a squeeze will happen.

From now on we are going to round up and start with 20 as a baseline.

[Tuesday March 30th - Day After Earnings.](https://u.teknik.io/9F7MI.png)

**SP - H -9.78, L - 8.52 C -9.3**

**SI is 25 (+5 Million)**

**Avg $ SI - 9.4** [Here's the proof thank you @zackstrades.](https://u.teknik.io/9GmEb.jfif)

What's crazy here is that 11 and 10 were blown through premarket. 5 Million Shares short between these prices is insane.

[Wed April 7th - Yesterday](https://u.teknik.io/GfVht.png)

**SP - H 10.65 L 8.92 C - 9.53**

**SI is 39.8(+20m)**

**Average $ SI 9.2**

So for the past trading days we have seen an average of 6 million shares collected sub 9 and the rest collected between 9 and 10. Trading above 10 was very short lived and we probably collected .5 million total SI during that time period.

Total Previous to earnings SI average is 20 m at 15.5 (generous to shorts) Total Post earnings SI is 20m at 9.2 .  15.5+9.2 is 24.6/2 = Total SI for 40 Million shares is a cost average of **12.3. Below max pain. Lets get that straight.  Max pain for the 4/16 expiry is the same thing as where all the SI is underwater.**

Take a second to think about this.  Please check my math.

**The current cost to borrow is 51.3%**

**The second part of this perfect storm is the OI**.  There is a [gamma ramp](https://u.teknik.io/BcFuF.jfif)  (u/dekkars made a cool discord bot) and its slick as ice.

Today's chart is bullish as fuck.

This thing is going to blow.

Canoo has DFV. Read the [10k](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-003823/0001558370-21-003823.pdf). Get to know it. You'll fall in love with it too.

**So what could go wrong?**

Well you could come home from work early without texting your wife first.

Additionally, the larger shorts could absorb a lot of the momentum if its smaller accounts that blow.

Also

u/jn_ku gives some caution ""  so the question is going to be whether the people who bought at, say, $14.50 to $16.00 feel good enough to ride the rocket up past their buy-in, or they sell as soon as they hit their break even after being underwater for so long trade volume above that point drops off, so if price gets past $16 I can see it going to $25, which is a bit beyond the prior ATH if the volume is still going strong at that point for beyond $25 it would have to be a catastrophic margin call type event for the biggest shorts, who might actually be some of the market makers ""

I think that means ""Shorts are Fuk""....

I was going to mention this a few days ago but I wanted to wait until things were really past a point of no return.

There's no shares left to short.  20 million SI is underwater. Longs know what they are doing.

Bull Tzu is in control.

I missed you guys

mn6t0l,,wallstreetbets,post,1617932634,"Why SPY will go under $400 soon, and possibly as low as $390We just closed 10 green days in a row. The hasn't happened since August 2020.

Based on the price of the S&P futures right now, the 1d RSI SPY just passes 70. It hasn't done that since late August before Spy fell $34 in 3 days.

The day before that crash the 9 day MA was $9 below and the 50d MA was $30 below. Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below. The biggest separation since the Sept crash.

Our 30 day volume is 55 million, which is 4 million more than august before volume spiked to 149M before Spy dropped $14 in a single day. The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical.

The reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for 7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory. Since Tech caused the crash last time, let's look at QQQ

The MA before the Sept crash? 60 points off. Right now? 52 points off. RSI last time? 75. RSI now? 67. The Stochastic just flipped today, as it did last time 4 days before the crash. And while we're at it, small caps last time fell 1 month before the Sept crash and didn't recover, similarly to how they are still lagging considerably behind Spy and QQQ right now. Spy needs to hit it's support line (392) to keep the algos happy. And eventually, the algos always get what they want.

I know TA is just crayons on graph, and news and market sentiment is more important. But for short term option gambling, there's a lot of red flags indicating we are due for a pull back. I'm opening 25% of my portfolio in Spy puts tomorrow mid day (3 weeks out). And will do that every day as long as RSI stays above 70 and we don't increase volume.",['SPGI']

Palantir Double Click Demo Day is 4 trading days away. We all know what happened last demo day. We also know the morning of the friday before demo day we saw a 40 cent drop on open and then from $ 25.50 to $ 32. We've got more outstanding shares now true but it's popped from 23-27 pretty easily even without a demo day in the past month. So Im 100% sure all except my 4-9 calls will print. We are about to breakout of a Descending Triangle. When this happens we pop up to the top of the triangle. Except we are in at least 2 descending triangles. One from $ 30 and one from $ 45 I'd say if we can hold 25 that should do the trick. After that It's 27.50, and then $ 32- $ 36. Might even run a little higher. I don't know if we will break out tomorrow but I didn't want to miss out on 4-9 lotto calls just in case. Definite breakout next week though. Which if people were smart they'd be buying Right Now! Imagine selling 4 days away from a major catalyst at near 50% lows. 

Options have almost no premium and soooo many people have been selling covered calls every day. IT's time to take their shares. Don't sell covered calls before major catalysts.

If you take profit on your ITM calls in the next 3 Trading days, use a portion of those profits to buy even further OTM calls on dips. And keep repeating.

What we want to see is heavy increase volume. Volume has been too quiet. Way too quiet. The trading range has been super tight. 3. Cent moves. This is due to accumulation. And sellers have dried up. We've tested 22.76 support levels twice in two days and it has been rejected both times. So this is a key level to watch. 

 We also want to see the price hold about the 5EMA for a long period of time. Steadily climbing throughout the day.

I've got way to many option chains to post all of them. And I may not be done buying yet. It depends if we get a dip tomorrow. It might also be likely we drop to $21.86 before shooting back up as these are the rules of the decending triangles. The 22.76 support level will be key to watch. And on the upside 24.50-25.17 for a breakout.",

mmzkjx,,wallstreetbets,post,1617910425,"Fubo Tv-DD: A potential Short Squeeze, but also a low risk/high reward investment. 

Alright, listen up y’all. I’ve been working on some FUBO DD, and I will be presenting you a bull case, but not without presenting some counter arguments.

Pros: 

1. **Sports Betting**: As many of you may know, FUBO plans to add integrated sports gambling tied into their streams as an option. The sports gambling market is expected to roughly quadruple in the next 4 years overall. FUBO only needs to get a small slice of that pie. 
2. **Value compared it to its competitors**: FUBO has a market cap of about 2.9B. ROKU=48B. DFKN=24.5B. I think we all understand Roku and Draft Kings are much better at what they do then fubo, but 10x-20x more valuation? That’s a stretch. Simply based of FUBOs revenue and market cap, this stock should be tripled. 
3. **Aggressiveness as a company**; With the acquisition of Vigtory, and a recent closing of a deal with Marquee Network I like how they are not satisfied as a company and they are swinging for the fences. 
4. **Options spreads**: i don’t know if its big brained gamblers or insiders who know whats coming, but the recent Volume on Calls compared to Puts is ridiculous. A put/call ratio from 0.07-0.19 for the rest of April, and an implied volatility of 130%.
5. **Future Growth, Cord cutting**: Cord cutting has only just started. More and more will move to streaming platforms, and FUBO has been winning more than its fair share of those customers. Their expected revenue for 2021 is 460M which is incredible based on their market cap. They have 550k subscribers,73% growth year over year. Also their advertising deals are growing too, 53% growth year over year. receiving $20 per user for ads. 
6. **Institutional Holders:** Tutes own roughly 40% of the shares, Disney being one of the big share owners.
7. **Natural Cycle of a Growth Stock:** If anyone thinks this is a POS stock because it's gone down a bunch for no reason? Guess what, pretty much any young company has that experience before the rockets take off. Look at ROKU for example. From Nov19-March 20, it lost more than 50% of its value over that time period.Then it jumped up 600%
8. **Short Squeeze**: FUBO has some serious potential for a short squeeze, the short float is at 35%, and it's already been beaten down enough. We’ve seen plenty of examples of the shorts picking on a “cult” stock that is already down plenty from recent high, with relatively low float.

Reasons for the stock collapse:

It has been a perfect storm for Fubo bears. The stock has been  in a free fall since February.

1. A pullback from its parabolic rise in 3 months was inevitable.
2. The Q4 2020, ER report confirmed the company's growth. But because they are not making money, which of course they're not, there was a selloff nonetheless.
3. Money was shifted out of growth stocks to more profitable stocks recently.
4. There are some fugaze lawsuits coming FUBOs way, but any stock that has fallen this much is under lawsuit, this is nothing to worry about.
5. Arcehgo’s hedge Fund defaulted $30 billion, much of that was in media companies (most notably DISCA, VIAC, and to a lesser extent FUBO). 
6. FUBO’s IPO investor Lock-Up ended April 6th, and the sell off on the 7th.
7. The shorties, its always the fucking shorts

Cons:

1. Technical Analysis, which is wizardry to a mere mortal like me suggests that worst case scenario, FUBO goes down to $15. But I can’t imagine we will get there, I think it holds up at support. It has bounced off the 200ma 4 times in the last couple weeks.
2. I can only assume they are bleeding cash, and may need to have an offering soon
3. Their business model , vMVPD, seems like a very boomerish way of “cord cutting”. Because you’re still paying for a bunch of shit you may not want. 
4. Will the gambling aspect work? People like DFKG and fan duel just fine. 
5. There are probably some serious bag holders in the $30-40 range, and we could see some resistance from them as they look to sell when they break even. 

TLDR:

I think this is an amazing swing play for a squeeze, a good long term investment if the squeeze doesn’t come. FUBO is 1 PR away from triggering a beautiful run up, then the FOMO sets in, and boom, they are back at $30 before you know it. And if you degenerates start chipping in, we’re at $50+ in a heartbeat.There are some obvious negatives about the company & the stock, but if there wasn’t , this puppy would be at $150 by now. This is a low-risk, high reward play that we are lucky to even have the opportunity to be a part of. 

PTs :$30 by May without a short squeeze

$50 by April-June if there is a squeeze

mnhnv1,,wallstreetbets,post,1617976334,"DD on Coupang and why it can it can moonAs you may have known CPNG recently IPO'd with the valuation of about $35, leading many to believe that the stock price is currently overvalued. I've taken a quick look at this company along with $SE and I'm bullish on CPNG. What I expect is for this company to demonstrate to the market what theoretical saturation really looks like.

My reasons:

1) South Korea is a considerably large, dense, wealthy country with income equality. Wealth equality is overlooked when comparing Asia. e-commerce stores themselves thrive on middle-income participants. There is no comparison in Asia.

&#x200B;

2) Their lifestyles are extremely busy compared to the rest of the world and the tradeoff for money over convenience is likely going to create a flywheel effect. G-Market is considered the cheaper option to Coupang for now, but as volume increases, prices are likely to fall. 

&#x200B;

3) Companies in S Korea, unlike SEA or China, are extremely ""Chaebol"". The large brick and mortar retailers have historically marked up their products. The standard was to sell something for multiple times MSRP Lately they have been getting destroyed by e-commerce and most of the e-commerce is being destroyed by Coupang. Ebay Korea has been looking to sell their position in the market for a fraction of the valuation of Coupang, but nobody is interested in buying. The number of competitors mean nothing.

&#x200B;

4) Coupang owns the entire supply chain, up and down. They own the inventory and they own the drivers and warehouses. Their algorithms are extremely good as well and it is catered to the Korea audience. As they gain control of this market and crush out the competition, Coupang will have significantly more pricing power. Their Amazon Price subscription is mere $2.5 USD a month. 

&#x200B;

5) Receiving $4.6 billion dollars in cash is absolutely insane, given that we've been able to see how far they have been able to stretch the $3 billion from SoftBank. 

&#x200B;

6) Coupang has demonstrate the deepest ability to monetize their consumers in the market. $SE has leaned on its extremely profitable gaming arm Garena to fuel infrastructure. But market depth and consumer service quality is unparalleled. Consumers trust Coupang enough to buy groceries on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

7) This company trades a significant discount to its peers for a few reasons, the lack of an AWS-like product. The reality is, Coupang is currently deploying the $4 billion dollars to tack on higher margin technology services. If you look at the second revenue line, the other sources of income is currently small, but growing rapidly.  The company looks poised to completely control a passive, wealthy and easily marked up audience upselling them on a wide range of products unheard of in other e-commerce platforms. Once that objective is completed, their services become exponentially more valuable. 

&#x200B;

8) Currently sales are $11 billion dollars, looking to trend to $22 billion in sales for next year. Best Buy currently trades at $16 billion in sales and is roughly $30 billion, which is roughly about what Coupang trades in line at (\~ currently priced at $50 billion but adding on a much faster growth rate would place the company north of that line, $80 billion is rich but reasonable). The key thing is that adding additional product lines has been very easy. Kroger alone has about $60 billion in perishable food sales and Coupang is the only e-commerce company in the world to really have controlled this type of market. Companies with no foothold in grocery stores are likely never going to have that going forward. Purchases by parents are built on an immense level of trust and are not price sensitive. Chewy sells pet food (another super insensitive purchase category). There's a lot of $$$ to be made here. 

&#x200B;

9) The owner is relatively good at pivoting and one hell of an operator so realistically you will not be able to buy the stock before the news comes out when they find their best new hot thing to drop $4.6 billion on. The best thing to do is wait for this stock to trade sideways for a while and pick up what you can while the narrative is focused on the inability to leave their home country (which ultimately will be the story for every e-commerce investment).

&#x200B;

10) Hostility to Coupang being unable to enter other spaces is overblown, other than general hatred for Chinese and the Japanese having hatred for specifically Koreans and humorous hatred for foreigers who don't take the time to learn a culture, there is no reason why Coupang can't compete in SEA. I've never seen this level of market domination in a competitive environment with reasonable profitability outside of Amazon. $SE has the advantage of Blue Skies and SEA gamer boys, but nobody can club heads like Coupang.","['EBAY', 'KR', 'BBY', 'AMZN']"

It sells a range of products that include lighting, cultivation equipment, grow media, nutrients and supplies. The vast majority of its customers are specialty hydroponic retailers.

In the first three quarters of 2020, the company increased its revenue 40% to $254.8 million compared to the first three quarters of 2019, with about 83% of revenue generated in the U.S. Gross margin during the first three quarters was 18.7%, and the company reported an operating profit of $10.7 million

Looking ahead into 2021, CEO Bill Toler, expects robust Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) industry demand will result in organic net sales growth well above the long-term company expectations outlined during their IPO roadshow.

**Controlled Envrionment Agriculture**

>Bill Toler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hydrofarm, said, “Fiscal 2020 was an excellent year for Hydrofarm in many ways. First, our organic sales growth across the year was outstanding, increasing in each sequential quarter and culminating in over 60% year-over-year growth in each of our last two quarters as our entire company **worked feverishly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the growing demand in the CEA industry.**

*Controlled environment agriculture is a technology-based approach toward food production. The aim of CEA is to provide protection and maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development of the crop. Production takes place within an enclosed growing structure such as a greenhouse or building.*

In other words, an advanced and intensive form of hydroponically-based agriculture where plants grow within a controlled environment to optimize horticultural practices.

The dual impacts of the coronavirus and climate change have had far reaching implications to our food system - from consumers, to retailers, across the supply chain and back to farmers and producers.

The urgency to innovate has never been more apparent. And with the right technologies, incentives and partnerships, our future food system can provide healthy food for all people and mitigate the effects of climate change.  

Controlled Environment Agriculture, including greenhouse and indoor production, is a small, but high-potential part of this future food system.

>The value propositions of CEA have been recognized by food and ag stakeholders, with local and urban controlled production receiving private investment to the tune of $2.0B across North America and Europe, emphasis in the [2018 Farm Bill](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/2018-farm-bill), and interest from corporations across the supply chain.  

**CEA & Cannabis**

Cannabis growers grow some of the most expensive crops. Flower growers, at scale rely heavily on timing of the crop. Suppose if a flower grower misses on-time blooming for Mother’s Day or Valentine’s Day, that’s a huge loss!

Cannabis and most ornamental flowers are grown as annuals. The whole crop is harvested at once – e.g. cannabis flowers, poinsettias and petunias. Some other flower crops such as roses or gerberas may be harvested multiple times during the crop cycle. Another common aspect of cannabis and ornamental flowers is that they are typically grown as a single layer in greenhouses, hoop-houses and indoor farms. Indoor cannabis growers grow cannabis typically in two layers as well depending on how they maintain the crop habit. Flower growers also use hanging baskets (about a couple of feet below the truss) in greenhouses in addition to crops grown on the floor or tables, a type of a two-layer growing system. Cannabis and ornamental flowers are commonly grown on substrates. For irrigation and fertigation, cannabis growers typically use drip or hand watering; flower growers use automated fertigation using booms or hand watering.

Cannabis cultivation at scale is highly involved as it’s still a relatively understudied crop when it comes to growing more than a few plants. Growers use various techniques to grow different “strains” most of which are not fully genetically characterized. These are typically highly expensive operations. There is a common misconception that the plants will grow and yield linearly when added more and more light.

Every plant has their maximum photosynthetic capacity and could typically be damaged by high light even when other environmental conditions and rootzone factors are at optimum. During the initial stages of photosynthesis, plants harvest the energy of instantaneous light (imagine light as packets of energy) and store them in special molecules that later pass that energy to drive sugar synthesis (we call that carbon fixation). However, just like any biological system, the photosynthetic set up of plants could only take light up to a given threshold, and beyond that, light would be damaging to the system.

>Cannabis is typically grown as single plants on substrates with a lot of plant handling; that means there is a greater chance for plant to plant variation in growth, yield and biochemical consistency if they are not grown under **uniform environmental conditions.**

Cannabis agriculture is a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States that is changing rapidly with policy liberalization. At this time, more than 60% of the US population have access to cannabis as states continue to legalize.

The most significant growth in the cannabis business has been the emergence of CEA and its associated energy implications. CEA is a production approach that operates “sealed” (controlled) rooms to control temperature, humidity, CO2, and other conditions to maximize crop production, especially for high value crops.  While CEA is not a new production approach in the Ag sector as it has been used for other high-value crops it is **increasingly being adopted by cannabis growers as it can generate 3-4 cannabis crops (turns) per year, supports more strains and optimizes quality control far superior to outdoor systems.** The typical CEA operation for cannabis production can support one plant per 4 square feet with the potential output of one-half pound per plant. The CEA production model allows the grower to vary energy and water inputs by production phase, especially the variable lighting to address growth stages.

Properly applied, Controlled Environment Agriculture, from Hydrofarm will provide protection and maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development and distribution of a cannabis or other specialty crop within the sector. CEA optimizes use of resources such as water, energy, space, capital, and labor, reducing expense and enhancing crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts. 

**Competition**

SCOTTS MIRACLE-GRO & HAWTHORNE GARDENING ($SMG)

Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO, Jim Hagedorn, calls the “pot business”, in which he intends to invest “like, half a billion” the “biggest thing I’ve ever seen in lawn and garden.” 

Formed in October 2014, Hawthorne Gardening is The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company's subsidiary for **cannabis growers** and one of the first major investments by a major United States corporation in the cannabis industry.

Did you know...

Scotts Miracle-Gro was the main financial supporter of push to legalize weed in New Jersey:

https://mjbizdaily.com/scotts-miracle-gro-leads-funding-to-legalize-adult-use-cannabis-in-new-jersey/

>The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has emerged as the primary financial backer of New Jersey’s cannabis legalization effort, donating **$800,000** to two campaign committees formed to back the Nov. 3 ballot question that would amend the state constitution to allow cannabis to be bought and sold for recreational use.

GROWGENERATION ($GRWG)

The company owns and operates retail hydroponics and organic specialty gardening retail outlets. It is engaged in selling of products, such as organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting technology, hydroponic, and aquaponic equipment, and other products needed to grow indoors and outdoors. The products include harvesting, soils and mediums, containers and trays, pest and disease control, nutrients and additives, hydroponics, grow lights, fans and ventilation, and cloning/propagation. 

**Technicals/Conclusion**

In my opinion, with [cannabis legalization](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/7088824002) on the horizon and many Americans still in quarantine, people will turn to homegrowing & DIY hydroponic projects. This is why Hydrofarm presents a **unique opportunity** in regards to US legalization of cannabis.

Hydrofarm brings productive commercial technology to **home Hydroponics**..

Commercial growers have been using efficient hydroponic methods for years. There's no worry about soil-born diseases or pests, and there's no weeding. For professional growers, quicker harvests and higher yields are good reasons to use hydroponics.

>At Hydrofarm we’ve adapted these proven techniques to convenient home gardening systems. We have incorporated high performance technology with quality professional-grade materials, and designed a full range of systems for your personal use.

In fact, 2 weeks ago, Hydrofarm [Highlighted New Products for Sustainable Indoor Farming](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210325005955/en/Hydrofarm-Highlights-New-Products-for-Sustainable-Indoor-Farming) & CEO Bill Toler spoke about how indoor farming will impact the agriculture industry in a [recent interview with Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/indoor-farming-impact-agriculture-industry-150514534.html).

- *“Today we're certainly linked to the cannabis business. But really it's about a controlled environment agricultural sector. It's all indoor growing. And so we think of it as, we have momentum going in our core business, which is our everyday established states all around the country, and we have a legislative agenda that's accelerating the business.”*

- *”So we have good fundamental organic growth going on underneath. And then we have new states coming online, four states passed adult use back in November. As you mentioned, a couple more have added since then. And we feel like that sort of wave is going to continue as we go forward as really Americans say they want it legalized, governments need the tax revenue. It's all pointing towards continued growth in the sector and in the category.”*

- *”So we believe that controlled environment agriculture not only affects obviously cannabis today, but is going to affect you know vegetables and perhaps fruits and other things as we go forward. And we think that there are lots of money and innovation and technology going into that space right now, as you mentioned.”*

The charts present a few bullish indicators..

Goodmorning Traders ... Snap back after 410 or before 410, that is the Question... my 4/8/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY 

Snap back after 410 or before 410, that is the Question...... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... 

Earlier this week I hinted that there would be a great opportunity later in the week for a contrarian type trade. That trade, I’ve heard it called a snap back, as in the rubber band snapping back after it has been stretched to its limit. We have a great set up for it right now so let's get into today's outcomes.1) we hold support at the 407 area and then break thru the 408.61 Area which opens the door to the 410/411 area. 2) We break thru support at 406area opening the door to 405 and below and retest of 406/407 would be a great time to short. 3) Consolidation between 408 and 405 before breaking higher or lower. 

1) we hold support at the 407 area and then break thru the 408.61 Area which opens the door to the 410/411 area. **45% probability**

mn0ccu,,wallstreetbets,post,1617912586,"Palantir Demo Day April 14th Calls?Hey, so if anyone remembers, PLTR Demo Day in January 26th turned out to be a huge success.  They showed some new features and focused on how they normally show off new feature releases for their customers.  They also gave us a little something with what I like to call the ""X-Com Global Defense Demo"".  It literally fking rocked.

The stock was hovering at $34.32-$36.87 through the day and closed at $35.37 kinda non-spectacularly.

However, what happened the next day was a huge surprise to everyone since the stock surged to the ATH $45 before closed at $39.

This new demo coming on April 14th (next Wednesday) is the first in a \*series\* of demos.  Sounds like some more in depth about how it works.  Hopefully it's not just a bunch of doods with crappy microphones reading off a boring ass script in their kitchen again.

Do you think we'll see another pop?  I'm semi doubtful since it seems a lot of sentiment has shifted over to GME, but it looks like the volume is super low.  $PLTR hasn't seen major trading volume for nearly a month.

In January, just before the day we saw ARK add to the position, but they added heavily post demo. This time its been reverse, ARK has added heavily pre-demo and holds almost 15 million shares. Lady Cathies moves in the coming days will be good to watch, I want to see her add big in the coming days. DO NOTE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: Cathie did NOT SELL any of her shares even at ATH when her investment had generated 50% return. I am going to be watching ARKs trade pretty closely in the coming days.

Also, the first demo day was just the beginning and we can see the shit it did to PLTR when people saw its product. This second demo day is an addition to that, and we may see even more interest because PLTRs been in quite a few headlines recently with the HULK contracts.

So I'm sure everyone has seen the news on national ketchup shortage. In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed. Sanitizer shortages, same thing. 

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume. Any ideas on why the small price action? Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked? 

This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made. I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past. (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets. Things look really really good on this company. 

When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point. I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.

I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me. If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up. If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up. Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up. 

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.

mncezy,,wallstreetbets,post,1617955220,"State of the Market + ULTA Overnight Trading Strategy  

**State of the Market**

Optimism is still high on practically everything in the market now. The main exception is the Japanese Yen, which is good for me, as I live in Japan while spending USD. Nevertheless, I do not think the downtrend in the Yen will last and will thus look for some way to hedge my dollar-to-yen (either by investing in FXY or leaving Japan).

Breadth is recovering, which is dampening our short-term pullback theory. However, a lot of the breadth recovery is in more defensive sectors, such as consumer staples. This could mean that investors are seeing growth stocks as overvalued and thus hedging against underperformance.

I’m still short-term bearish, expecting the gap in the SPY to fill.

**Today’s Trade**

I see a lot of insider selling in ULTA. We have director Charles Heilbronn selling half a million shares for nearly $2M and an overall total sell:buy ratio of 2.4, which is 50% higher than usual. When we see large amounts of insider selling, we are usually close to a top.

Unlike most stocks in the market today, ULTA shows an overnight dip pattern. Whereas most stocks are bid up overnight, ULTA sells off. This makes going short ULTA overnight every night a decent short trade strategy – and it doesn’t label you a pattern day trader.

With the current run-up in ULTA, it is slightly overbought. The Fibs also show that ULTA tends to pull back after such movements. With a resistance level at around $325, the current price is a good short entry point.

ULTA’s max pain for the end of the month is $305, so this is a good price target. That gives us about $15 profit downward. I’m going to be holding ULTA short overnight until the end of the month.

Three potential strategies should work here:

l Hold ULTA short

l But also sell ATM puts during the day

l Buy the puts back at the end of the day

l Repeat daily

OR

l Sell ULTA ATM calls at the end of the day

l Buy back at the open the next day

l Repeat daily

OR

l Buy ULTA puts at the end of the day

l Sell them at the open the next day

l Repeat daily

I’m going to run this until the end of the month. If you want a long put suggestion, I’d say go with the Apr16 $330 puts today and then switch to equally ITM puts a week out starting next week (i.e., the Apr23 puts).

Happy trading.","['GPS', 'ULTA']"

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares.

* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**

It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.

You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.

Over the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.

What happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.

The complaint alleges that GE and Plug ""understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable"" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just ""the JV"" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them ""the guys who financed 9/11"" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with ""nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server"" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.

Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, ""In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date"", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)

So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.

But the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)

Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm).

**ABOUT MUDDY WATERS**

**THE SITUATION**

Muddy waters published a NNOX short report in September 2020. It read **""NNOX has no real product to sell other than its stock""**. Essentially calling it a complete scam. They are fairly active on twitter, tweeting about NNOX, at times ramping up activity as they increase their short positions. Typical short seller tactics, calling every product fraudulent and accusing any insider selling stock as proof of a ponzi scheme.

NNOX April 1st closing price was $41.33. Single source **FDA clearance was announced Friday April 2nd** (markets closed due to Jesus). Monday April 5th NNOX opened at $64.00, after hitting $70+ in pre-market. Shares started dropping from this high right at the opening bell and closed at $48.55.

*Enter SSR*

**SHORT SALE RESTRICTION (SSR) RULE**

For those who don't know, when a security **drops 10% or more** (at anytime during the day) from the previous day closing price, SSR is triggered and the opening of new short positions in that security is limited. Under SSR, new short positions can only be opened as stock prices goes up, and this remains in effect until the end of the next day. Essentially **SSR makes it much harder/riskier to short sell successfully.** When a big short seller has enough control of a stock, they can **tactically keep the intraday drop to slightly under 10%, to avoid SSR while maximizing profits**.

On Tuesday, the NNOX low of the day was $43.71, a 9.97% drop from Monday close. That's an extra **0.03% drop away from SSR**. On Wednesday, the low was $40.40, a 9.74% drop from Tuesday close. That's an extra **0.26% drop away from SSR**. Sure we can't rule out this out as a coincidence, so we'll just call it **statistically extremely improbable.**

Despite a disagreement of their thesis from the FDA, muddy appears to be playing their usual games.

**SHORT VOLUME**

**TODAY**

This morning, there was more positive news for NNOX, involving a partner's (FujiFilm) **[patent filing](https://twitter.com/TerraPharma1/status/1380137316434341890) that would use Nanox rights and IP for innovative mammography equipment**. This news may have helped create a small pop in NNOX price this morning, but once again the shorts squashed any bounce and brought NNOX to even lower levels than yesterday. NNOX closed today at $40.08, a **lower price than it was before FDA clearance**, only three market days after the news. 

**PRICE ACTION**

For anyone familiar with price action when a big short seller is involved, the [NNOX 5 day chart](https://imgur.com/PiFaFfD) paints a pretty clear picture. A gradual slide each day, with any potential peak quickly snuffed out and brought back down to a new low.

**CONCLUSION**

Before Ellen_Degenerate_69 chimes in, you're right, selling on news is nothing new. However, context matters. The majority of the bear thesis hinged on a lack of regulatory clearance. **Recent price action, short volume, and narrow SSR avoidance is all consistent with a big player at the table**. Considering their outspokenness on this company, all signs point towards muddy waters & co.

**TLDR: Nanox (NNOX) has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging, recently reached a milestone with FDA clearance, shares have been dragged down by 🌈🐻’s, and is de-risked at current levels. I like the stock.**

mn4x8u,gtvhems,wallstreetbets,comment,1617926920,Seriously - Carson is a piece of shit human being. And NNOX has an amazing catalyst product. And a stupid squeeze would be so simple due to just how low the float is... but once that Multi Arc gets approved... it’s actually gonna fuck the shorts back to the hole for which Carson came!,
mn4x8u,gtvlyj6,wallstreetbets,comment,1617929264,"I'm a longtime holder of NNOX. I love the tech, but I'd be lying if I said that the shorts haven't gotten to me. Still holding and still believe but at this point I'd give nearly equal weight to a 10x or a 0x scenario. Good enough odds for a position but not a yolo IMO",
mn4x8u,gtvtld7,wallstreetbets,comment,1617933234,This company has been pretty sketchy. Maybe it does have some revolutionary tech but it also seems plausible to me they'll never bring a product to market.,
