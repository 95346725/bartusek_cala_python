**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**Bear case:**

The 10-year bond yield is at a year-to-date high.

So far, in March, the NASDAQ has gone down on every single day that the 10-year-yield reached a new high.

No exceptions.

**Bull case:**

Technical Analysis Tuesday time, bitches.

Try this: Open the NASDAQ chart, slap on some moving averages, and draw a box around the last 11 days of candlesticks. Or just [look at this picture](https://i.redd.it/palom11yh4q61.png) where I already did it for you.

You'll notice that, for the last 11 days:

* The NASDAQ has been perfectly bouncing between the lines of that box
* The bottom line of the box is the 100-day moving average
* We're running out of space in the box

The current trend is about to come to an end, and we haven't significantly broken through the 100-day moving average yet. We should be able to expect a breakout by the end of the week -- and, as long as we don't bust through that support line, I feel pretty confident it'll be an upward breakout.

We should hit that 100-day moving average fairly early in the trading day today, so we're likely to close higher than we open today.

**Forecast:**

Today is going to be a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,067** and a **low of ~~12,886~~ 12,925.**

mg91ws,,stocks,post,1617083224,"Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV PlatformChoi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

mg91ws,gsrzp69,stocks,comment,1617088429,"It seems fairly odd that only a Korean reporter finds out this. Searched the news in Japanese, and found no such thing.",
mg91ws,gssc4ha,stocks,comment,1617100985,"I'm sceptical. This is at odds with both company's positions for the last several years.

Toyota has loudly stated that their primary path is hybrid ICE/EV towards a final goal of Hydrogen fuel cells. There was a presentation came out about 18months/2 years ago on it, and there's been nothing released that I've seen contradicting that plan (until this rumour). Furthermore Mr Toyoda has been publicly dismissive of Tesla, it would be very culturally odd for a Japanese ~~CEO~~ President (Edit wrong title) to step away from those unusually strong words and back into partnership.

Similarly this isn't congruent with Tesla's stated plans (although they are far more likely to do an abrupt change than Toyota). They have stated they're happy to sell their skateboard when they have spare capacity (ie production capability exceeds demand), but they've also made it very clear that their primary focus in the car space is the ""machine that builds the machine"" (in Musk's words) - that is they're focussed on developing their ability to build their gigafactories and the optimisation of the build cycle (the single piece casting of entire subframes etc ""giga press"" as they call it) and FSD. Trying to get a partner up to speed on their software platforms is going to divert a lot of resources away from their core goals and isn't in line with the way Musk has behaved for the last 5 years across all his companies.

If Tesla were looking for a Japanese partner to crack into that space, wouldn't a smaller player like Honda or Subaru be a more logical choice than a company that has been very negative about their previous experience with them ?","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

mfxzyn,,stocks,post,1617047728,"Don't stress about red days & your portfolio being down.There's been a lot of negative sentiment thrown around with the recent market volatility. Some people clearly haven't been investing for a longer period of time (neither have I) and others just don't deal well with the bad days. 

My advice is this: during red periods take a look at your investments and see if anything about the company has changed since you started investing. If there is no significant change why would you sell now?

Second, if you have cash on hand try to incrementally buy shares of your highest conviction stocks or buy those who you think have been hit hardest. 

Third, think about the overall state of your portfolio. If it is too focused on one particular section, then consider broadening out your portfolio to different ones so you mitigate risk if you are not comfortable with the current volatility of your portfolio.

The final piece of advice is to just not stare at the graphs everday if you can't handle looking at the red candles. If you are like me and you are investing for the long-term why would you need to look at the graphs every single day?
Just grab the stock chart of any stock for a 5 year period and look at the peaks and downturns in stock price. Some stocks lose like 30 percent from one peak before doubling in price compared to that peak and stockholders who held through that downturn eventually got rewarded for their patience. This doesn't mean that every investment you make will turn out alright in the long-term but panicking and selling at a loss just because the price went down isnt going to make u money especially if nothing about the company changed.

Just today as I write this my portfolio is down about 3 percent while the nasdaq is only down about 0.5 percent. I am not too worried because I am investing with money I don't necessarily need right now and am investing for the long-term so temporary downturns are only opportunities to add to my highest conviction positions. The point is, if you are investing like me theres no need to panic about what is happening now. 

Anyway, I wish u all good gains in the rest of the year and don't stress about the market too much, there is more important stuff in life to worry about and we've got time on our hands.

Edit: 

Also, if you are relatively new to investing and want to learn more, there is alot you can learn just through reading books and practicing doing your own DD on stocks

BND? Out.  Bonds are being sold off like crazy and real yields are negative. 

GE?  Out.  Going through a restructuring right now which seems to look promising, but they're doing wonky things like a reverse stock split that I don't like.

GME? Out.  Yeah it might go to the moon, and Ryan Cohen might save it, but then again I might also be dead by the time any of that happens. 

(I was holding all 4 of these at one point)

Other hypothetical examples:
ARKK? Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It's not something I'm sure I want to be holding, and definitely don't want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don't know if I trust her abilities going forward. 

ARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don't understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. 

TSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword *might*)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. 

XXII? Pass.  You probably haven't heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their ""zero nicotine cigarettes"".  That's just wonky, folks, even if there might be a small market for that, ugh, maybe. 

Bitcoin?  Out.  Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain. 

I probably triggered some people. Feel free to explain why I'm wrong about any of these.

And of course, no risk, no reward.  So if you want to put a little bit into Bitcoin or Tesla, by all means.  But my current philosophy is that we can just avoid all the wonkiness and go for the straight forward plays.  You know, the Apples, Microsofts, Costcos, Phillip Morris, etc.  Or hell, go ahead and stick it in VOO. I didn't, that's not my style, but it's a safer play than probably everything I listed at the beginning.

I'm new to this so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.  But I think I understand why they say that ""most people lose money in the stock market"".  It's because they're always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like ""Elon Musk and Tesla are the future"".  It's not smart, and it's a recipe for disaster. 

If you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don't find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. 

TL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.

Or do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.  But that's just my style based on my current risk tolerance.

""Too much Apple. Not enough oil/energy sector/natural gas. No REITs? Where's the telecoms. Att/Verizon/t-mobile? Grab yourself Ford or GM.""


I don't really have much to say, but it does make reading some fair amount of posts annoying, when you realize it's just a ton of people who are afraid to lose money and make terrible choices investing in businesses or industries that they themselves do not understand, but feel like they understand.

I would bet on the guy with 2-3 tech holdings than the guy who has, what I call, master of the universe syndrome. In the wise words or Charlie Munger:

mfzbvg,,stocks,post,1617051361,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 29, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. 

Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. 

The United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). 

In other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.

mgjw9b,gstf92o,stocks,comment,1617122339,"Personally, I would start by building up your savings more if I was in your position.

I'd probably do this:

500 to Roth, 500 to taxable, and 1000 to savings

Then once you get your savings higher maybe only put 250 or 500 into that, if anything at all, and more into investments.


I'm in my early 20s as well and I personally feel much more secure having closer to 10k in my savings at all times in case I need cash for something. That way I dont have to sell of any positions I have invested in in order to cover those expenses.

But obviously you have less bills than I do since you live at home, so you might opt for being more agressive than I would.",
mgjw9b,gstj8i1,stocks,comment,1617124127,"So I’d tone it down a bit but here’s why:

Investing for the long run is great. But right now you’re sitting on a ton of disposable income with almost no expenses. 

That will change significantly for you in the next few years. You’ll want to move out, get your own vehicle, buy your own food etc. You will go from having tons of disposable income to probably very little.

This isn’t financial advice but in my opinion I would look more into building up nest eggs for a down payment on a house, buy a car in cash etc. 

Solid return on investments is great but even the best investments will fall well below the return you’d get by putting an extra 20/30k on a down payment that you don’t have to pay interest on for the next 30 years. Same goes for buying a car in cash/mostly cash. 

I have tried to buy most of my major purchase in as much cash as possible and over my life it has saved me probably 10’s of thousands in interest payments, which you can then re-invest into stocks/ETF/mutual fund or whatever. 

Stocks are great but have a hard time earning you money when you’re sitting on 50k of card/loan debt adding interest plus a low down payment mortgage. 

The last thing you want to do is then have to pull out good investments to pay down life’s other expenses.

Edit: as an added note, the fact that you’re young in your 20’s and thinking about your financial future in this way is putting you miles ahead of most people your age. So kudos.",

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-30.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures fall after Dow record as yields jump

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday as the 10-year Treasury yield hit a new 14-month high in early trading. The Nasdaq dropped Monday. The S&P 500 on Monday fell from the previous session’s record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing at another record despite weakness in bank stocks caught in the fallout of the Archegos Capital Management margin call chaos. With two days left in March, the Dow and S&P 500 were sitting on solid gains for the month. The Nasdaq was tracking for a monthly loss.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield hits new 14-month high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.77% early Tuesday, taking out another January 2020 high, as Covid vaccine rollouts and planned infrastructure spending boosted hopes of a broad U.S. economic recovery. However, the move also stoked inflation fears and put growth stocks, many of them tech names, under pressure because higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

> # 3. How Goldman and Morgan Stanley avoided Archegos losses

> * In the Archegos meltdown, triggered by last week’s slide in shares of ViacomCBS and other stocks, Goldman Sachs avoided losses in the episode, CNBC’s Hugh Son reported. By the time Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and Japan’s Nomura said early Monday they unloaded positions on behalf of Archegos, Goldman Sachs and its Wall Street rival Morgan Stanley had already finished unloading their positions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Archegos is a family office founded and by Bill Hwang, a former equity analyst at Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management.

*****

> # 4. CDC chief warns U.S. headed for ‘impending doom’ in Covid fight

> * The U.S. is facing “impending doom” as daily U.S. Covid cases begin to rebound once again, warned CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I’m scared,” she said in an emotional, candid moment during Monday morning’s press briefing. Even as vaccinations accelerate nationwide, coronavirus hospitalizations are also climbing and falling fatalities are starting to plateau. Walensky urged Americans to “just hold on a little longer.”

*****

> # 5. Biden tells states to reinstate coronavirus mask mandates

> * President Joe Biden followed his CDC director’s comments by urging governors and local leaders who dropped sweeping mask mandates to reinstate their orders. While indicating that some states should wait to reopen their economies, he also condemned “reckless behavior” likely to spur more infections. “We’re giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains,” Biden said in Monday afternoon’s press briefing. “As much as we’re doing America, it’s time to do even more.” He said a failure to take the virus seriously “is precisely what got us in this mess in the first place” and could lead to more infections and deaths.

You’ll never get that access. 

Beyond that, it’s being very enmeshed with the industry. Biotech, for example, if you’re waiting for news to show up on CNBC or Bloomberg, you’re late. You’d want to keep the latest tabs on research publications, academic papers, journals, and industry specific publications. You’d want to have medical and scientific experts on call to evaluate any claims or progress that comes out. You’d want to monitor pipelines and FDA announcements.

Right now the market is going through a correction with some of the most popular individual stocks that retail investors love.

SPCE NIO PTLR to name a few.

These valuations have been over the moon lately and mostly by short term traders or investors who want to make a quick buck.  

Problem is long term investors look at these companies and even ones we like we can’t buy at that valuation.  So it leads to the stocks of these companies having huge swings up and down on short term news.  

These stocks need to come down, which would be a good thing.  WHY?  Because then it will attract long term investors who actually want to buy in this company and won’t sell even if it goes up 100%.  You want long term investors in these companies and unfortunately you don’t have that now.",

mgiigt,,stocks,post,1617117948,"Question about Supplementary Leverage RatioWhat are your thoughts on the SLR expiration? Are some people overreacting, or is there an actual cause for concern?

I was looking for the change in ratio back last March, and the change seems to be a 1% difference. 

>The supplementary leverage ratio generally applies to financial institutions with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. It requires them to hold a minimum ratio of 3 percent, measured against their total leverage exposure, with more stringent requirements for the largest and most systemic financial institutions. The change would temporarily decrease tier 1 capital requirements of holding companies by approximately 2 percent in aggregate.”

However, I believe the quote below is why most people are counting on their to be major issues. It seems like banks would have been accounting for this over the past 9-10 days after the Fed's announcement, that there would be no changes and they would let the changes to the SLR expire.

>The change would exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the rule for holding companies, and will be in effect until March 31, 2021.

Source: [https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/84939/what-is-the-supplementary-leverage-ratio-and-why-is-it-important](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/84939/what-is-the-supplementary-leverage-ratio-and-why-is-it-important)

In addition, it seems that larger banks may have always needed to keep a 5% SLR to deal internationally and also keep a bit of a buffer. 

Source: [https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/us-banks-sufficiently-capitalized-to-withstand-slr-expiration-22-03-2021](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/us-banks-sufficiently-capitalized-to-withstand-slr-expiration-22-03-2021)

I get the expiration could cause volatility in the bond market, which will have a direct effect on the stock market, but I do not see this as causing a market crash like 2008 like some have stated. I also think that most banks and hedge funds would account for this after the Fed's announcement (meaning this could be priced in). The Fed also seems open to change, if this has huge adverse effects.

Am I just completely missing something here? Sometimes Reddit feels like a ZeroHedge article, but then again, the mainstream media seems untrustworthy. I have seen some analysts asked about SLR expiration, and they have said that the change is minimal. On the other hand, some redditors are really calling for a market crash because of this. 

My positions since 2015 have been all in tech. I am seriously debating if pulling out for a bit would be good, to see what comes. This is a pretty big decision for me, as I am also sure I would have to account for cap gains tax in doing this when liquidating/rebuying in my positions. If I do this, I probably would rebuy back in to VOO/VTI instead. I know probably the most common suggestion will be cut from my winners and invest in VOO/VTI anyways. I just think I can do better than 10% per year returns myself. And from the articles I have read, the SLR rule was changed to allow banks to do more lending to households and businesses, so it seems like it would hurt the banks bottom line more than anything else in terms of revenue.",

Excerpt:

> The release said the name change “is expected to take effect in May” and called the change a “public declaration of the company’s future-forward investment in e-mobility.” It said Voltswagen will be placed as an exterior badge on all EV models with gas vehicles having the company’s iconic VW emblem only.

> To “preserve elements of Volkswagen’s heritage,” the release said the company planned to retain the dark blue color of the VW logo for gas-powered vehicles and use light blue to differentiate “the new, EV-centric branding.”

> The release said Voltswagen of America would remain an operating unit of Volkswagen Group of America and a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, with headquarters in Herndon, Virginia.

I found myself in a similar situation about two years ago. Initially I thought the lesson was that speculation simply involved more risk than I thought and that I should be in lower risk investments.

In truth, I'm still learning how to do both of those things. But while I learn I've parked my assets in index funds. Why? Because Buffet and Bogle are right. I'm not going to beat the market. But I can partake in the markets success. 


As for selling ARKK for VOO. I would say no. Let it sit, maybe even recover. But more importantly take the time to really learn from your experience and develop an investment thesis that realistically fits your capabilities and goals.

Recently I noticed a super high influx of new beginner investors, prolly first because covid freed up some time, and the GME fiasco bought on even more attention. A lot of beginners are asking questions regarding how to manage their money, and questions about building a portfolio. I've seen that a lot of ppl are chasing stocks with a lot of hype rather than doing DD. Gambling is fine but it would be dangerous to think of it as investing. I sympathize with you if that's the case, it's easy and addictive and really gets the endorphins going. When I just first started learning how to invest, I didn't know anything either and got drawn to penny stocks. Luckily I was already broke so I didn't lose a lot of money. Things I find really useful are valuations and contrarianism, but to each their own.

A few months back, there was a [REALLY USEFUL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need/) on [r/UndervaluedStonks](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/) with a WHOLE LOT OF VALUABLE information. Please check if out if you haven't It's a literal gold mine.

Secondly, I would like to add additional resources. Investing books have been really helpful in paving the way for me to invest properly, and I'm sure they can be helpful for you too.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company’s platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.


**PETER THIEL JOINS AS A BOARD OF DIRECTOR AT ABCELLERA**

https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/peter-thiel-joins-abcelleras-board-of-directors

“AbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what’s possible,” said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 


**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB**

Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19

Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)

mgbzbf,gss92cm,stocks,comment,1617098027,"Are you a German/Austrian?  


I say this because this is based on my experience being in these two countries and the way they handle payments. Visa/Mastercard will beat out Klarna ALWAYS. This idea of buy-now, pay-later is the VISA/Mastercard model and has been around for a longtime and is so engrained in the culture in the US.

As far as Klarna, it's a good fintech for Europe because of the way banking is done as a whole across the EU.  


For the most part, payments are done simply with a credit card and/or paypal if you don't have a credit line to do so.. But, getting a credit card is so easy that you have to be in some serious serious credit debt in order to not have one.   


As far as paying Klarna. I can't see them really taking over the Klarna scene. The only reason why I think Paypal has a good stronghold is because it was a way for people to pay who didn't have a CC and it's sort of the best way to pay for things as far as a developer API if you wanna still pay with CC. it was highly integrated into a lot of e-commerce platforms.",['PYPL']

Then, using your fun money, make your stock picks. You will make some bad choices and good choices, but it's fun to do the research and own shares of companies you believe in. But it's not likely to return as well as index funds over a 20 or 30 year period.

Some random broad market ETFs to look into. These are not necessarily endorsements by me as everyone will have different picks based on their likes and strategies, but just for example:

VO -- Vanguard mid-cap companies  
SPY -- S&P 500 trust  
QQQ -- Invesco Nasdaq 100 tracker  
SCHB -- Schwab U.S. broad market  
SCHX -- Schwab large-cap companies

Some examples of thematic ETFs:

FINX -- financial technology  
ARKW -- Ark Invest next-gen internet companies  
ITA -- iShares aerospace & defense  
BETZ -- sports betting and gaming (gambling)

Just examples of the types of funds to look into to give yourself broad exposure to a variety of markets and thousands of companies without the risk of picking winners and losers.

mg4mug,gsr66a4,stocks,comment,1617067975,"No, at the rate you're going, you're creating an individualized ETF.  I went this route and realized it's not a good strategy.  There will come a time when there's too many companies to manage, and the ones that grow will be stunted by the ones that are failing.  Like I said, you're going a path of a personalized ETF.

If you're going this route, you're better off looking into 3-4 index or ETF, putting a bulk of your money there, and then selecting a 2-4 companies you really really like that you think will grow in 5-10 years, and building a substantial foundation into those.  Here and there you can buy a few more of other companies, but you shouldn't gravitate too much beyond your core.  

In your case, you can invest small amounts and DCA over time.  Even if you cant afford Amazon at 3K, you can still buy fractional shares (in response to your ""saving a lot of money and making a big purchase.)",['AMZN']
mgdhrx,,stocks,post,1617102580,"General Mills and Cinnamon Toast CrunchAs many of you have probably heard General Mills has some issues going around about their cereal. Cinnamon Toast Crunch in particular. A Twitter user posted a picture of shrimp tails in their box of cereal and it has gained some attention from others on Twitter and some new outlets. He also said he found a piece of string in the box and that the squares have something black cooked into them. 

Jensen Kerp (the Twitter user) has went and taken the squares to a lab to get them tested for rat or mouse droppings. At the time of writing this there has been no update about it. 

General Mills has been trying to help and said they are looking into it. They have also said “We can say with confidence that this did not occur at our facility”

What are the chances of there being more boxes like this and how do you think it will affect the company if these issues occurred at a General Mills facility?

I do not own any General Mills stock

mg2g8o,,stocks,post,1617060292,"Some clarity on what is meant when something is ‘priced in?’Suppose company A is trading at $10 a share with 100 shares in circulation. Market cap is $1000. Assume it is directly correlated to gross revenue and nothing else. 

Suppose they announce new plans of expansion assuming perfect information. This new expansion will result in 50% increase in all future revenue streams per year. 

This increases the share value by 50%. Now trading at $15. 

Suppose now the day actually comes where the plans have materialised and annual revenue is reported at exactly 50% increase. Perfectly in line with expectations. 

How would the market react to this? 

In a perfect world with no uncertainty it wouldn’t react at all. However in an imperfect world the announcement of the expansion wouldn’t have increased the share value by 50% due to uncertainties such as not meeting expectations, plans falling through etc.

$BDR  - Beautiful channel up, and it is right near trend line up. This is beautiful but it is very volatile so do not get caught bag holding.

$BE   - This a lot like $ALDX, with the support being mega strong here. If it holds could be a very easy 10 - 20% quickly.

$FET  - This trend line is very strong, and it is also right above a support. I love this play, and it may need a few days to develop.

$HL   - Fantastic trend up and support area. If this also holds could ne a very quick trip to $6.25 for some quick money.

$SQ   - Again, a beautiful support and trend line up, gorgeous. If this holds it may be massive move coming.

mg6gyq,,stocks,post,1617073533,"What are FTDs and why it can affect the overall marketI’ve been keeping up with this sub, as well as many other subs, and YouTubers, to figure out what’s going on in the market. 

This info could explain why so many of you have seen red days.

FTDs, or failure to deliver, are stocks that the market makers, MM, were unable to deliver, even after you paid for the stock.

Normally that’s not a big deal, maybe the MMs couldn’t find a stock in time, and will give you an IOU until it can locate that share.

Well, this would be ok, if you don’t use it as trading strategy to make millions of dollars from retail, allegedly.

If an MM is in the business of selling retail investors a bunch of stock, they could in theory wait to purchase that stock at a later date, possibly when the stock is at a lower price.

That’s great, until you run into a problem. What if you start shorting the stock, in order to reduce the price, so you can buy the stock you owe, but the price doesn’t go down, so you short it some more, until you surpass the available float?

Well now you have a problem, and the DTCC has big concerns. So many in fact, that they just passed a new rule, an amendment to that rule, and had a secret meeting in the last couple of weeks.

What are these rules about?

I believe it’s called the Recovery and Wind Down procedure. It states that in case of a financial crisis, the DTCC (those who actually owe the stock, and put your name as the “investor”) will be in charge of slowly liquidating any MM that’s over leverage, and transfer its clients into a “safe” MM in order to not collapse the market.

Well why is that important, and how does that affect me?

Wednesday-Friday was when the new rule came into effect, where every HF and investor is required to state their short positions daily, instead of monthly. 

Lo and behold, Friday there was a liquidation of a HF, who was over leveraged 30to1 across different accounts, banks, and markets.

So what is going on in the market?

I have stated only a brief summary of what people are talking about around the web. I will not answer this questions, as this is all speculative, and not financial advice. I can give you my hypothesis, but I believe I said enough for you to come out with your own conclusion.

The banks are wondering the same thing, and are asking if that HF is the only one. All we know is that some HF, and investors are over leverage, enough for the DTCC to be concerned and pass new rules.

I bring this info here, because retail is always the last one to know anything, even if all of this is public info. I hope many of you can use this, and prevent you from becoming bagholders, from what looks to be turbulent times.",

However, I can't seem to shake off the feeling that chart patterns reading is more closely like flipping a coin in terms of its reliability. I'm aware that it's probabilistic in nature but ***if the chances of being correct is up in the air, why is it such an universally used tool for traders & investors?*** 

To me it's much more like one of those self-fulfilling prophesy type of analysis and if the prediction turns out to be wrong, let's just stamp it as ""false breakouts"" or whatever other jargon names. I almost never hear a responsible undertaking of ownership when wrong predictions happen. This is rather in stark contrast w/, say, statistics or math based modelling for algorithmic trading that is more introspectively honest. Whoever came up/designing said model is not afraid to explicitly point out its pitfalls from a stat/math context.

I don't mean to patronize & bash TA/chart patterns cos I did make money using it here & there but it never is a tried & true tool some ""TA analysts"" make it to be. Perhaps a more experienced trader can weigh in on the issue? I don't think I'm alone in this.

Lately I have been adding up value and dividend stocks to my tech-heavy portfolio and it has worked better than I expected. But there is a limitation to it due to those two taking up such a sizable chunk of my capital. GOOGL actually is up 17% while AMZN is down 5%. If I sold both now, I would have about 6-7% in realized gains. Which isn’t bad but not sure if it would still beat the gains I would make from value/dividend stocks. 

My goal is to load up on value stocks I already own to make enough dividends. With tech stocks these days, I just don’t see if they can maintain their growth trend this year.

The Fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that are included in the Index, designed to track the price movements of stocks of companies involved in the 3D printing industry.

I've been reading for a few years now how industrial applications of 3D printing are expected to explode, so I was naturally pretty excited to read about it. But it seems overpriced by a pretty wide margin.

\- P/E is 39 (asset class median 22)

\- P/B is 5.7 (asset class median 2.5)

\- P/S is 3.6 (asset class median 1.87)

And consider that these figures are based on a period in which sales, I would assume, were a bit down given that industrial output wasn't what it's been in years past.

Don't get me wrong, there is absolutely such a thing as justifiably high figures in each of these categories, but there is also such a thing as a solid company/industry being overvalued because investors have priced in gains beyond what are reasonable to expect.

My other concern is that INDUSTRIAL applications of 3D printing are set to boom but I don't know what the trajectory for personal printing is supposed to be, and this ETF could be weighed down my potentially lagging growth in that area.",

As a global play I hypothesize that developing countries will be on the rise in the next 5-10 years. I'm reluctant to do China and most of southeast asia due to heavy influence of politics, but India seems to geographically, and mentally, be positioned for best growth in the future. I want to avoid ETFs and also non-US listed companies as I think US regulation is beneficial to transparency and hopefully helps keep companies straight, at least to a point).

I found a lot of reading on bullish and bearish patterns.

What I’m confused about though is intervals/time chunks.

A lot of the literature on patterns just talks about candlesticks which are calculated daily.

One candlestick = 1 trade day.

I can see that software tends to let you chose the intervals you want. So you could have candles for a 5 minute chunk etc.

Are the bullish and bearish signals the same regardless of if you’re looking at 5 minute candles vs 1 day candles?

Or are there different patterns?

Also, for the patterns where the candles are for say like 5 minute intervals, are the top and bottom of the “wick” the high and low during those 5 minutes and the top and bottom of the thick part the start and finish of those 5 minutes?

I am having difficulty understanding the basics of a long vs short position in trading foreign currencies. I know you should take a long position if you expect the currency to rise, and a short position if you expect the currency to fall. The problem is calculating the profit. For example, the British pound appreciated relative to US currency from January 19 to March 16. On January 19 the exchange rate was 1.3644 GBP/USD. On March 16, the exchange rate was 1.3901 GBP/USD. The Pound obviously got stronger. I have to “invest” $100,000 USD into GBP. This means I could buy 73,292.29 pounds on January 19 and sell for 71,937.27 on March 16. Does this mean I have a profit of 1,355.02 pounds? When I convert this back to USD, the profit should be $974.76 (1,355.02 pounds divided by the current exchange rate of 1.3901). Also, if I took a short position it would be a loss of $974.76? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",
mg3tkb,gsr339k,stocks,comment,1617066348,"Was just about to answer you this on WSB. If the pound is worth 1.3644 per dollar and you are changing $100,000 to pounds, then do $100,000 divided by 1.3644. You get $73,292.29.

Time to change that back to dollars, this time you take your $73,282.29 and multiply by the new rate of 1.3901, which gives you more than $100,000 in US funds. 

Your profit in US dollars is the difference. It will be the same as exchange rate 2 divided by exchange rate 1, then that figure multiplied by the initial investment.

For the profit in sterling just multiply the value of pounds by the ratio of exchange rate 2/exchange rate 1

mfxp8v,,stocks,post,1617046894,"Market Commentary (the former Tiger Club member margin called, Volatility in the Markets, TIGR earnings) - 3/29/2021 

Hello investors,

Hope everyone had a great weekend.

Much has happened over the last couple of days and there's a lot to unfold. I'll start off with the last Friday's selloff and end with one final thought about the markets going forward.

Before we do, one thing to keep in mind as we think through what’s happening in the markets is the power of media.

I hear lots of media noise: changing opinions, shifting sentiments and rising calls for market meltdown.

And understandably so. I mean we are going through an ""unprecedented"" period with events that have occurred either very long time ago or never before: the geoplitical tensions between China, Russia, and the U.S., the new bond bear market, coordinated efforts by central banks and fiscal policies to stimulate the economy, the global pandemic recovery, and new flood of retail traders causing disruptions to the markets.

It's not hard to understand that trading these days is more difficult than at any other point in time throughout history.

Even the experts get it wrong all the time.

The smartest economists last year predicted that it would take at least 3-5 years to fully recover from the pandemic damages but the same group of people are predicting end of 2021 or early 2022.

Look at how the derivatives markets have incorrectly predicted fed funds rates in the past. By the end of 2009, the market was predicting the fed funds rate to increase more than 200 bps by 2011 and take a look at what happened.

📷

Remember back in March 2020 when the epidemiologists predicted that we will not have vaccines until 2023 or that 20 to 30% of the entire population will be eradicated?

My point is that in bad or good times, the ""media"", representing a group of experts in the respective fields, can present real hardships for us by playing with our emotions.

My personal strategy in dealing with the volatile market sentiment is to be very open-minded, listen to every word the experts have to say, especially their graphs or evidence-based arguments, form your own opinion, and do not be afraid to change your opinion if you've realized you got it completely wrong.

Doing your independent research and forming your own opinion is critical because by doing so, you will have a higher conviction in your trades.

Having conviction means you are holding onto the trade or stock when the stock falls 80% or not be tempted to sell when the stock triples.

You are able to do that because even if the stock falls 80% you know this company is a great business and you know it will quadruple in the next five years because it’ll grow its earnings and the market will eventually price to that.

If you do not have the conviction, then you’ll be questioning why is the stock falling and you will question your judgment and be tempted to sell.

Now onto today's topic.

I'm sure most of you have heard by now but last Friday, we had a hedge fund getting margin called, triggering large declines in stocks that the fund sold in blocks.

We need to first understand exactly what happened in order to know if this has any real implications for the markets.

This fund is called Archegos Capital, run by ex-Tiger Asia founder Bill Hwang. Tiger Asia is the Asia division of legendary investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, and Bill Hwang was one of a select club of analysts (the ""Tiger Club"") trained by Julian Robertson.

As a result of forced liquidation, the prime brokers that covered these positions also incurred losses, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and Credit Suisse.

With that said, as in any type of news, you have to make your own judgment in terms of whether the news is real or not.

I'm not saying the news is fake but I'm saying that it's probably impossible to know if it's 100% true because no prime broker will disclose the name of their client who just had billions of losses.

Practically speaking, does it matter if it was Archegos or another hedge fund? What matters for us is that some big fund most likely went bad and had to sell a bunch of securities. I wouldn't want to waste a minute trying to figure out which fund this was or whether if this story is actually true.

This fund sold $20 billion worth of shares in total, including ViacomCBS, Discovery, and big Chinese names like Baidu 10mm shares, Tencent 50mm shares, and VIP Shop 32mm shares.

📷

What exactly triggered them to liquidate all of these positions in such a strong bull market?

I would imagine it's the Chinese names and the growth stock selloff during the recent weeks. Look at their performances recently.

📷📷

📷📷

Viacom CBS went from $100 at intraday top on 3/22 to $64 low on 3/25, roughly 40% drop in less than a week. This came at a time when all other growth stocks were going down in flames, especially the Chinese stocks that took hit due to the rising geopolitical risks.

What does all of this mean for the markets?

Well, a few outcomes are possible in my opinion.

Bearish: full-blown market deleveraging, forcing other funds to liquidate and triggering a downward cycle and stocks to selloff.

Bullish: this turns into another September 2020 event where the Nasdaq sold off 10% caused by Softbank's bulk option purchases and the markets recover like it didn't happen.

Most likely, it'll be somewhere in the middle.

The reason I think it won't turn into a market mayhem is the same one I've been repeatedly mentioning for the past few months. Fed has literally promised a proper market functioning and fiscal spending is none like others in the past.

Look at Fed's dot plot for instance. They're as dovish as an institution can get, expecting to keep rates at 0% through 2023.

📷

Even if the market tumbles and the liquidity dries up, causing the S&P 500 to drop 15%, I have no doubt that the Fed will intervene to calm the markets down, which means the drop will only present incredible opportunities for us as investors.

**I am of the opinion that this is another one of those opportunities to buy into the dip.**

As I mentioned in this memo, I believe that this ""great rotation"" from growth to value will cause short-term stress in the growth names but not in the long run.

The reason is rather simple.

I don't think a company that's growing its top line at 30-40% with 80% gross profit won't care if the market rotates from growth to value stocks.

An e-commerce company will also be marginally impacted by vaccine rollouts. I mean obviously it won't see the pandemic-level of sales growth but I don't think an e-commerce firm that grew its top line at 25% a year pre-pandemic will see its sales growth decrease to single digits simply due to people not staying at their homes all the time.

The point I'm trying to convey is that if you pick great businesses growing rapidly, the market has no choice but to price them to their full earnings potential, whether the market rotates from growth to value.

We may see a lower than expected return but it's still a large return. For instance, if we were expecting Fiverr to trade at 10x P/S by 2025, then we may need to lower that projection to 8x P/S and our overall expected return may change from 250% to 200%. And I don't think you should reconsider investing in a company just because your expected return dropped from 250% to 200%.

On another note, I believe we will experience an inflation level we haven't seen in the last 40 years. The 10-year breakevens are already skyrocketing.

📷

My contention is that gold will be the primary beneficiary of this trend but I'm also open to other ideas to take advantage of the upcoming inflation blowout.

**The second topic I wanted to discuss is TIGR earnings last Friday.**

I posted my thoughts on TIGR on these two memos.

(see the comments)

They reported a very strong earnings report on March 26 pre-market and I was very pleased with the results.

Some of you may have seen that as soon as their earnings were reported, the stock went straight up more than 20% pre-market. After that, the stock opened 14% lower most likely due to the China tensions and Archegos liquidation of Chinese names, and fully recovered from intraday lows by the end of the day.

Given that the business is still in great shape with lots of potential, I view these drops as opportunities and I believe TIGR will thrive in the future.

It's certainly not easy to hold onto the securities that burn your portfolio. That's why everyone has different levels of risk appetite and one person's trading strategy will not work for another.

You have to develop your own system to manage risks. If you are not comfortable with a 40% loss, try limiting your exposure to riskier names or hedging your portfolio through options, as I mentioned in here.

Thank you for reading! I hope this helps and please feel free to leave any comments or feedback.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-29.html)

*****

> # 1. U.S. futures drop after Friday’s records for Dow, S&P 500

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Monday after a late-session rally Friday sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up over 1.4% and nearly 1.7%, respectively, as stocks benefiting from a successful Covid reopening outperformed, again. The Dow and S&P 500, which both closed at record highs, saw weekly gains about equal to Friday’s advances. Dow stock Boeing rose 3% in Monday’s premarket after a huge aircraft order from Southwest Airlines. Southwest shares were up modestly.

> * The Nasdaq on Friday erased an almost 1% loss and closed up 1.2%. However, the tech-heavy index still declined about 0.6% for the week, with just three days left in March. The Nasdaq was tracking for a slight monthly loss, while the Dow and S&P 500 were poised to turn in solid gains for the month.

> * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Monday, trading below its recent 14-month high. The rapid rise in yields this year has been troublesome for growth stocks, many of them tech names, as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Credit Suisse, Nomura take hit from U.S. hedge fund fallout

> * Credit Suisse warned Monday of a “highly significant” hit to its first-quarter results, after the Swiss-based bank began exiting positions with a large U.S. hedge fund that melted down on margin calls last week. Japanese firm Nomura said it’s evaluating a potential loss estimated at $2 billion. Shares of Nomura and Credit Suisse were getting slammed in Monday’s premarket.

> * The hedge fund at the center of the fallout is Archegos Capital Management, which was forced to liquidate positions at the end of last week. The moves by the multibillion dollar U.S. family office, founded by former Tiger equity analyst Bill Hwang, caused a wave of selling pressure Friday in U.S. media stocks and Chinese internet ADRs.

*****

> # 3. Ever Given cargo ship blocking Suez Canal is partially floated

> * The giant Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal was partially refloated early Monday, days after the vessel got stuck and brought a vital global trade route to a standstill. The Suez Canal Authority said the ship’s course has been corrected by 80% and further maneuvers will resume when the water level rises later in the day. It remains unclear when waterway will reopen to traffic as hundreds of ships are backed up and waiting to enter the Suez. Maritime data showed at least ten tankers and container ships changed course to avoid the logjam, including U.S. ships carrying natural gas for Cheniere and Shell/BG Group.

*****

> # 4. Biden to push infrastructure before health and family care

> * President Joe Biden will separate his sprawling plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure into two separate pieces. Biden on Wednesday will unveil the first part of his plan, focusing on items like rebuilding roads and railways. The second part of the president’s plan — including child-care and health-care reforms, aspects of what’s sometimes called social infrastructure — will be released in “in just a couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday in an interview. Taken as a whole, the legislation is expected to cost more than $3 trillion.

*****

> # 5. Fauci warns U.S. only ‘at the corner’ of Covid pandemic

> * With the possibility of safer summer barbeques just a few months away, along with the promise of widespread Covid vaccine supply in the U.S. by the end of May, many Americans may be feeling as though the nation has finally turned the corner on the pandemic. However, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that America is really only “at the corner.”

> * New daily U.S. cases, while sharply lower than January’s high, increased 12% in the past seven days compared to a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly half of people ages 65 and older have completed all of their necessary shots, according to CDC data. However, just 20% of the adult population is considered fully vaccinated.

I think there is a lot of pent up demand for social and in person shopping experiences. People miss social experiences, an element of public gatherings and things like movie theatres. But a movie theatre kinda sucks as a stand-alone business. So in the future I see a combined experience where people go to one location for things like movies, Dave and busters or other arcades/activities, shopping and restaurants.

mfsvyk,,stocks,post,1617034049,"How do I choose an index fund?Hi.

I am fairly new to investing - only 18 months or so.  Currently very little money as a medical student, but starting residency in July and will be an attending in 2024.  Right now I mostly invest in dividend stocks and my portfolio is small (~$6,000).  That said, I’m going to start getting paid soon ($64,000 annually) and will eventually be making a decent living as a doctor.  I want to find an index fund to invest in in the long term.


At present, I bank with fidelity and like some of their options (FSSNX and FZROX).  They both have low expense ratios and are cheap to get into/ maintain since I have an account with fidelity.  They also have decent diversity, with FSSNX being a bit less technology-heavy than FZROX.  I’m leaning more towards FSSNX over FZROX because it’s been around for longer, has higher diversity, and in my opinion less overall risk.


That said, I am a total noob and would love input on my thought process.  Am I going about this right?  Any suggestions from someone who isn’t an idiot like me?",
mfsvyk,gsp8rw9,stocks,comment,1617034392,"Your gonna wanna read the wiki of this if you are mainly interested in long term index investing, it has most of what you need:

/r/bogleheads

FSSNX is small cap where as FZROX is total market from what I saw. FZROX includes a blend of small, middle and large companies so by itself it's properly diversified if you are only looking at the US market. Adding more small cap on ur end isn't needed for diversification and that's more of a you decision if u think it's worth it.",
mfsvyk,gsp9p2x,stocks,comment,1617034822,"Fidelity has a nice search function for mutual funds. I'm unsure if you used that to find the 2 that you already found, but that's pretty much all you need to use to find a good mutual fund

Other than that, there are really only a handful of index funds that anyone will ever suggest. VTI, VOO, SPY",
mfsvyk,gspfz73,stocks,comment,1617037693,"FZROX is a great “total market” index fund because it has zero fees. If you want the lowest maintenance investing strategy that has lots of diversification with great growth potential, FZROX would be hard to beat",

If you are risk averse and want low fees, you can search/filter by those criteria.  I have been a Fidelity customer for about 20 years, and have almost exclusively used Fidelity Growth Fund (FDGRX) for my investment accounts.  They closed the fund to new investors about 10 years ago, but there are other comparable funds.  Just start poking around on the site and read what each funds' goals are, and what companies make up the fund portfolio.  Some people just blindly throw money into funds to ""diversify"" without reading what's in them, and they end up with 4-5 funds that all invest heavily in tech/growth stocks, which is redundant.",
mfsvyk,gspaoul,stocks,comment,1617035279,"If they have ""target retirement 20xx"" type funds, you could just pick one of those. It will be something like 60% US total market, 30% international, and 10% bonds. Then you can just have 1 fund which makes incrementally investing small amounts really easy. And its diversified enough for super long term holds.

But if you want small cap just go 100% FSSNX, you really can't go wrong since you don't have a lot of money yet, its more important to build up savings than maximum returns. And with a fund like that you probably aren't going to get completely wiped out, and have a chance to out perform the S&P. Once you have a few hundred thousand then pick a better portfolio.",['SPGI']

mfx9y5,,stocks,post,1617045758,"First ETF investment. Volume & cspx vs vusa? (Belgium)Hi guys

I live in Belgium and after my first year of working and saving, i'm looking into starting out with investing. I've spent some months of research and tracking the markets. But is still have some questions i'm struggling with.

\-How do you guys feel about starting out on the s&p500 index? (Or maybe even something like VWRL)

\-After comparing different s&p500's i think CSPX would be the best option for me. Especially with the avoided dividend taxes as it's an acc. However, on my broker account. I can only see the cspx etf available on the euronext amsterdam (amst) market. This means the etf itself is available in EURO currency itself. I think i'm fine with this as it's out currency, but when i look at the average volume it's only around 9000. This seems extremely low to me and i'm not quite sure how to feel about this? For VUSA this would be around 60K. But if i take a look at VUSD it's already at 189K, but this one is listed in usd currency ofcourse. When i look at the US versions like VOO i see volumes way in the millions which makes especially the cspx look quite bad.

\- I'm thinking about starting out with a small starting budget and then continue this as a passive really long term investment. So let's say about 2-300 euro/month budget. However, when using my current broker (which i like to use) i have this 7 euro fee for each transaction up to 2500 as a fixes fee. Wouldn't it be better to just save it up and do the investment itself after about 3 to even 6 months? Would save me quite a lot longer term but i feel like i could be missing out some ""good"" moments because of this.

Thank you very much for helping me out in this new world guys!  
Looking forward to the advice over here and i'm even open for other suggestions if you happen to think i'm completely heading into the wrong direction.",['SPGI']

mfs7dp,,stocks,post,1617032162,"Stock Scraper Update as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit?usp=sharing) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter).

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit.
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

Good luck and have fun all! Hope this helps someone!","['GOOGL', 'TWTR', 'AAPL']"

mgbntz,gsscib5,investing,comment,1617101329,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are mixed as of 0600. Small caps are up 0.5%, rebounding from their 2.6% loss yesterday. Dow futures are up 0.2%. The S&P 500 is flat and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.

The big story is still Archegos Capital. Yesterday I said this didn’t look like an LTCM-type of systemic event. This morning that view appears vindicated. 

Couple of reasons for this. For one, financial stocks would be on the front line of any massive unwind as many of these banks were/are counterparties not only to Archegos, but to its counterparties. But that fallout appears limited to Nomura and Credit Suisse. The XLF (ETF that tracks financials) is up 0.7% in the pre-market. 

Then you have the stocks that were at the center of Archegos’ implosion (or cover images for the story, at least): Viacom and Discovery. Both saw extensive selling from Friday through yesterday but are up in the pre-market today: VIAC by about 6%, DISCA by 1.5%. (Yeah there are a bunch of Chinese internet stocks that also figured into this story, but they have other issues affecting them).

Finally, you have the news coverage of the story. These have moved on from what you would call ‘first day’ news pieces to post-mortem type of things. A quick sample of the headlines this morning:

* “How Archegos’ $20 billion decision led to banks’ share prices tumbling”: CNBC;

* “What is Archegos and how did it rattle the stock market?” WSJ;

* “Archegos Capital blowup: What investors need to know”: Bloomberg;

* “Goldman U-turn on Hwang put bank at nexus of margin call”: Bloomberg;

Knowing a thing or two about newsrooms (from experience), I can tell you there is no way anybody would have time or interest to pursue projects like this if the bigger story about Archegos was still developing.  

Things could certainly still (d)evolve from here. There may be pockets of information about Archegos that could cause fear in the broader market. But for all intents and purposes, the story would appear to be done. In a few weeks you may have already forgotten about it.

Back to today’s markets: Ten-year yields have quietly climbed north of 1.7%. Maybe the inflation story will surface again.","['SPGI', 'DOW', 'VIAC', 'NDAQ', 'DISCA']"

So Archegos' defaulted margin call made banks have to unwind like $20 - $30 billion via block trades. It was a family office, so that was all Bill Huang's money. I heard earlier that they think he was leveraged 7:1. Let's run with that. Assuming the lower end of the aforementioned range, that means he was worth about $3B.

Three. Billion. Dollars.

And he was levered 7:1.

If I was worth $3B and someone asked me what my risk tolerance was, my answer would be ""fucking ZERO. I am rich as whale milk and all I need to do is not lose all of my money. If it could make a tiny bit over inflation that's fucking wonderful."" I'd be knee deep in top-grade bonds and ancient, boring companies with good dividends and strong balance sheets. And this idiot could've just done that and been insanely rich for the rest of his life, but instead he decides he wants to be in a position where if things goes south by 12.5% he's tits up.

mg6m07,gsrs079,investing,comment,1617081597,"Discounting (future) Cash Flows (DCF) is how you would value those companies. The problem with DCF is there are a lot of assumptions that have to be made that can change a valuation rather significantly even if the assumption is changed a little. 

Some other commenters said to stick to ETFs or mutual funds and I would agree. Mainly because time and again picking low cost index funds (like VTI and BND) beats stock picking over a full market cycle (bull + bear market). But also because there are so many things to get right when stock picking. You have to get the market direction, sector, company within that sector and timing of when to buy all right in order to beat an average index. Picking a broad index means I only have to get the market direction right over my 30 year timeframe, which in the history of the stock market has never had a 30 year period of being down so I feel pretty good about getting that right. If I think a sector will be a higher return than broader markets, I can pick an ETF that focuses on that sector. 

Picking a company wrong can be costly. Look at LNC. Stock price is close to the same level as it was 20 years ago. Yes you could have bought the dips but more than likely you would have panicked when the stock went from $70 to under $5 in 6 months back in 2008. If you did happen to buy, when do you sell? Once it got to $25, a 500% return? That only took a few months. Hold until $50? That took more than 5 years. Holding for $70 again? That would have taken nearly 10 years.",['LNC']

As a global play I hypothesize that developing countries will be on the rise in the next 5-10 years. I'm reluctant to do China and most of southeast asia due to heavy influence of politics, but India seems to geographically, and mentally, be positioned for best growth in the future. I want to avoid ETFs and also non-US listed companies as I think US regulation is beneficial to transparency and hopefully helps keep companies straight, at least to a point). Motivated by this thinking i took up finviz with a basic filter of India based companies, sorted by market cap, and then further looked into how the charts, analyst recommendations and social media sentiment looks.

mfs7vk,,investing,post,1617032204,"Stock Scraper Trending Data as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

Good luck and have fun all! Hope this helps someone!","['GOOGL', 'TWTR', 'AAPL']"

mfq8df,,investing,post,1617026582,"Activision Blizzard DD: Short AnalysisRevision I:
I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...
_______________________
Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

this is the most wall street analysis of a gaming company ever lol

I'm not gonna mention activision's immense library of titles as well because I don't know that side of the company as well but...

Blizzard has some of the most valuable intellectual property in video games, right up there with Halo/God of War/Last of Us and they're very experienced in effectively monetizing their platforms. Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are some of the most anticipated games of the next two years and will likely be played for an entire decade (assuming all goes well). There are literally entire sports leagues dedicated to the games blizzard creates (Hearthstone, OW, SC2 for awhile) noting that it's **very** difficult to build and sustain a competitive league for so many games. 

However i do agree there are plenty of problems with the company as well, namely a lack of recent innovation and several misteps engaging their community. I think I'm still bullish on the ""soul"" of the company as a whole and would buy for the long run (assuming OW2 and Diablo review well)",['EA']

mfkoyj,,investing,post,1617005626,"BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial ResultsUp until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

"" Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon "" Helium demand did not exceed supply last year, largely due to decreased use during the pandemic. 

"" Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining. "" Terming this companies financials as ""good"" is uh... a stretch. They raised some money (not enough to execute their plan) and they don't spend much because they aren't doing much.

"" Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day."" Test well (singular) has shown this. As mentioned previously the second well is much much worse, mostly in terms of flow rate, but the helium percentage is a bit over half as much as well.

"" Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less. ""  This seems to assume all wells are as good as the first and not as bad as the second. 

Finally, you use analysis from the cormark report here: [https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom\_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom](https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom)"" but gave a $20+ price target while ignoring their $4.25 price target.  If you're going to use their info you should probably also at least mention their price target.

I am by no means trying to convince people to stay away from this one. I just am presenting the other side for you.  You should be aware you're paying 128 million for 13 million, a plan, some leases and a few holes in the ground at least one of which seems to produce a significant amount of helium. That's pretty much how most companies start, but people should be aware this is still really early stages and a lot could still go wrong.",

mfdia0,,investing,post,1616976808,"Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice.",

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['DE', 'TSLA', 'ICE']"

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['BAC', 'SPGI', 'WAT', 'ED', 'GS', 'ES']"

memnob,gsiebsk,investing,comment,1616880104,"Note that this portfolio is designed for Canadians.  XIC in particular is Canadian stocks, so Americans might want to allocate that to the US (and probably a bit to international, since there's already a lot of US in the portfolio), and people from other countries may want to allocate the 30% to their home country/region.

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC
* 30% VUN
* 10% AVUV
* 16% XEF
* 8% XEC
* 6% AVDV

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments.","['GOOGL', 'SPGI']"

meu01j,gsomxj5,investing,comment,1617023727,"I have a portion of my active investment allocation in a tactical asset allocation strategy that uses expected excess returns of SP500 relative to 10 year treasuries to determine allocation. SP500 10YR expected total returns are forecast using a valuation model (not CAPE but similar enough) to predict price return plus current dividend yield. 10YR treasury expected returns are estimated as current yield. The historical error in forecast versus realized realized 10 year return is used to evaluate the probability that stocks will outperform treasuries. I use this probability directly as an allocation target. In other words, if stocks are predicted to have a 90% probability of outperforming treasuries I allocate 90% to stocks and 10% to treasuries. If the probability is 50%, I allocated 50/50. I use a 24 month moving average of the probability to smooth the allocation and slow down transition in allocation. This slows transition from equity to bonds and vice versa. 

In general, I find that active strategies that use a probabilistic transition in allocation are more robust and easier to live with than strategies that make an all in 0% to 100% switch in allocation. Valuations don't switch instantly so I don't see why you'd want a strategy to switch allocation instantly. You're ""optimized"" 2% threshold probably has closer to 50/50 probability of either stock or bond outperformance - it makes more sense to take a 50/50 allocation until the valuation becomes more extreme one way or the other.

As you say, historically it's rare for the 10 year forecast of stock return to be less than the forecast for bond return so this strategy tends to be heavily allocated to stocks.

This incredibly simple strategy has actually been one of the most consistent performing of strategies I follow over the past 2 years.",

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

mea4sx,gshjot9,investing,comment,1616869480,"I just bought my first shares! I would appreciate it if someone could listen to my reasoning and give me some feedback.

I decided to purchase a few shares from Avantium (AVTX). 

This company is a spinoff from Shell, and their goal is to develop efficient green industrial processes to transform raw carbohydrates from “waste” sources such as wood chips into useful chemical compounds. This is a local company and I visited one of their buildings about two years ago during a university trip, and I saw that their building is modern and well-equipped. Some research groups from my university work with them and I am aware of the work that they are doing. So I have some level of understanding of the technologies that they are developing, and I can see first-hand that the investment that they put into R&D is not being wasted. 

Their current market cap is 138 million euros.  I think that this makes it a very cheap stock, and I expect to see considerable growth. My reasoning is the following:

The company is planning to build the first commercial FDCA plant. FDCA is a sugar-derived compound that can be polimerized into a bioplastic, most notable PEF, which is a leading candidate to replace PET plastics. The industrial process relies mainly on green cyclic catalytic processes. European legislation against standard plastics and in favor of green chemical processes will incentivize companies to use FDCA in the coming years.

At the moment the construction of the FDCA is still uncertain, as they have conditionally secured only 95 of the 150 million euros of funding that they need. This represents a risk, and I think that this is part of what is keeping the share value so low. I think that it is very likely that the company will secure the funding later this year, and this should cause the stock price to increase due to the lowered risk.  
I have tried to get an idea of how much this company could be worth in a few years. I think that AkzoNobel is a nice reference, as it is dutch company that develops paints and coatings and was founded in 1994. Its market cap is 18 billion euros. I also looked at companies that produce PET, and chose Eastman Chemical Company as a reference - its market cap is 15 billion.   
I think that I am not being too optimistic when I say that the market cap of Avantium could be above 2 billion euros 10 years from now. Since the current cap is 138 million, this means that on average an investment on this company would result in an average return on investment of 40% over the next 10 years.   
Putting it in these terms and looking at that 40% yearly ROI figure makes me think that I may be being far too optimistic about the growth of the company. What should I do to come up with more reasonable predictions? Am I thinking too far ahead?   
If you read this far, thanks a lot! Any feedback would be very welcome.",['EMN']

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

me5yvd,,investing,post,1616816797,"Canadian Index ETFs XIU - XIC - VCN - ZCN comparison 

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

 ETF                                                          AUM in Millions

#  Comparison volatility

Beta

 Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index – **XIU**                             0.91 

 Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp – **XIC**           0.98 

 BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp – **ZCN**                      0.98 

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

A  company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the  following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its  business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another  industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the  future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx  operates as a digital health company that provides communications  solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

I like this, I think it's a really good idea; and dealing directly with sales staff means they will pay. Companies don't always pay for quality, but they do pay for sales.

Whats their addressable market? say it takes off & becomes a staple; how much will insurance companies pay them?

My concern is Insurance companies are shitty, shitty business partners to have; when you do business with a monopoly expect to get fleeced. How hard would it be for Insurance companies to replace them with their own software development teams; realistically how much can OPRX charge before they do so?

In Buffets terms; companies need a 'moat'. Nobody is going to pay OPRX **unless they have to.** How can OPRX force its customers to pay?

Also, I thought management's discussion about opportunities in EHR was pretty compelling:

""Like no other digital health platform in the market, we deliver important information in real time at the point-of-care right when clinical decisions are being made. We have access to 10s of millions of patients and most physicians, as well as the technology compliance operational support to continue to play a major role in the ever evolving digital health market.

Our partnerships with EHR and e-prescribing companies enable us to augment that physician workflow with actionable insights by providing additional real time critical information to clinicians who are dealing everyday with complex healthcare scenarios. We can improve the patient and physician experience and ultimately treatment outcomes.""

So my dad bought shares of Indusind international holdings (the holding company of Indusbank) in the 90s for 1 USD per share and they are based in the Mauritius. The company is offering to buyback the shares for 5 USD per share. 

From what I understand the company isn’t publicly listed so I would have to find a buyer myself but according to [this](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/indusind-bank-s-promoter-plans-to-get-listed-overseas-11613609396633.html) article they plan to become listed overseas by the 1st week of September.

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['SPGI', 'WFC', 'BLK']"

mcpqqp,,investing,post,1616645951,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['NDAQ', 'TWTR', 'TSLA', 'AAPL']"

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above. 

>An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

mcqwym,,investing,post,1616650283,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['MSFT', 'QCOM', 'INTC', 'AMZN']"

mc095v,,investing,post,1616572099,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably.

mbu9i0,,investing,post,1616549438,"It appears the recent move in the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.2% to 1.7% had very little to do with inflation expectations.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/04/business/financial-markets/bonds-stock-japanese-economy-global-economy-u-s-treasuries/   
[March 4]    
>Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
>....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['IP', 'NFLX', 'MSFT', 'FB', 'NI', 'CRM', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'GS']"

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal *trial*s, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through *clinical* *develop*ment.""

""The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,"" said Robert Koenekoop, MD, MSc, PhD, FRCS(C), FARVO, a *clinical*\-scientist from the Montreal Children's Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surgery. ""Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients' biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal *trial* *develop*ment."" ",

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",

mbvs0e,gs1o9xi,investing,comment,1616592794,"~~Can you give the table number? Table 7 on pg 379 of the full prospectus is maybe what you’re looking at?~~

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']
mbvs0e,gs1qi8s,investing,comment,1616593860,"Honestly I don't understand it. What if you just bought a non-leveraged ETF with leverage. Let's say you are an individual investor and you get cheap margin or take out a loan on your real-estate etc and buy ETFs with that money. Surely this amplifies the return of the underlying and you don't need to worry about rebalancing yourself.

Now say instead of an individual investor, you pool together other investors and buy non-leveraged ETFs.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['ADI', 'JPM']"

mc8nea,,investing,post,1616599768,"Fluent (FLNT) - Highly volatile + Market Psychology play 

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

\- It has been recently (17.03.2021) **downgraded from 'Outperform' to 'Market Perform'** by Barrington Research, due to the slowdown in the growth for the fourth-quarter. The management claims that their decision ""... to limit its business to higher-quality advertising traffic..."" **may result in being beneficial in the long term** ([Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/why-fluent-stock-was-slammed-on-wednesday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)). Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

**Information worth noting;**

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term.

* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop.

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['HD', 'NDAQ']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['KSU', 'UNP', 'CSX', 'NSC']"

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

I know this is a long post and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I don't really have a specific question, I would just like to hear any feedback (besides, your an idiot, and don't ever buy stocks again), advice, even similar stories.",

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above.",

That'll happen when you compare a global fund vs a US only fund and focus only on the US part of the US/ex-US cycle. I can almost certainly point to times where VTI would have been worse than IWDA.

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

Does anyone else just want to puke when they see their commercial on CNBC for Follow the Smart Money?

If you haven't seen it, here's their strategy in a nutshell: 

Imagine you're in middle school, and there's a quiz in Zoology class today. Zoology is taught at different periods throughout the day, every kid in the grade will take the quiz at some point throughout the day. Everyone's known about the quiz for weeks, and most kids have studied and are prepared. Not Pete and Jon, they haven't studied shit. They have a different strategy to pass the quiz. 

Luckily for them, Pete and Jon have Zoology during 6th period, late in the day after many kids have already taken the quiz. So, Pete and Jon ask as many people at Recess as they can, what their answers were. They have no idea who the smart kids are, but there is a really loud kid who is POSITIVE he got the right answer. Pete and Jon don't know if this kid is smart or dumb, but they do know he's very convicted about being right. So, they decide to listen to this loud kid and use his answers when they take the test.

That's their strategy: copy the loud kid. Not sit next to the smartest kid in class and cheat off his/her paper, just listen to the loud kid at recess and use his answers. Follow the Loud Kid.

In their real world applications of this strategy, they monitor options chains and wait to see a volume spike in a particular order. They have no idea who is making the trade, it could be the smartest trader in the world, a hedge fund covering a position or some drunken billionaire letting his pet monkey pick his next stock trade. They see that high volume trade and then they copy it. That's it. ""Oh look, Jon, someone just bought 1000 ROKU June 350 Calls. That's a lot, let's buy those too. Good thinking, Pete."" The end, that's what they do.

Good morning Traders, Short week +Volatility holding = big move... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... [Premarket outlook 3 30 21](https://youtu.be/hTTfq-GJMH8) 

📷

Short week +Volatility holding = big move... Before I get into today's theme, let me go back and clear up something I said yesterday. Short Squeeze and gamma squeeze are very similar but not quite the same. As I explained, the short squeeze is when a lot of traders take one side of a trade (let's say short like the spy on Friday for example) and due to either time or lack of available shares on float, the trade goes the opposite direction causing a sharp jump in price because of short covering (which is the buying back to close positions). Team short covering with normal buy side activity and you have an influx of buying that causes the sharp price jump. On the other hand, a Gamma squeeze is when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock price. 

  Getting back to today's theme, we have a 4-day trading week. Yesterday internals seem to peak around 3pm and then turned over kind of setting the tone for today. Also, even thru the positive gains early in the day Volatility never really backed off. Market makers expected move is at 402.8 on the top side and 389.16. We also have a new month starting on Thursday. Just from these things Its possible to get a big drop today and then bounce back on Thursday to close the week. So, Let's look at the possible outcomes for today. 1) if we hold below resistance of 396area we look for the following dominos to fall break of 394 area opens up path to 390area. Then break of 390 area opens up path to 388 area and below. From the open you may have to be quick because it could happen fast and may only retest 395 area. 2) we hold support at the 390 area look for consolidation between the 391 area and the 396 area before break out higher or lower. 3) We break thru resistance area of 396 which opens a path to 400.  

Either way buckle up because it seems to be a volatile 2 days ahead. 

1) if we hold below resistance of 396area we look for the following dominos to fall break of 394 area opens up path to 390area. Then break of 390 area opens up path to 388 area and below. From the open you may have to be quick because it could happen fast and may only retest 395 area. **50% probability** 

2) we hold support at the 390 area look for consolidation between the 391 area and the 396 area before break out higher or lower. **10% probability** 

3) We break thru resistance area of 396 which opens a path to 400. **40% probability**",

Possible Partnership - Not Confirmed Yet. The original Article is in Korean, Translated by Google.

[https://n.news.naver.com/article/023/0003604866](https://n.news.naver.com/article/023/0003604866)

It is reported that Tesla and Toyota have reviewed the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage. According to an official from the Japanese automobile industry on the

28th , Tesla and Toyota are considering jointly developing a small electric SUV platform (the car's basic skeleton). The partnership review has been conducted since last year. Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology onboard its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform . In addition , Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year , are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the company's new technology public event'Battery Day' in September of last year, ""We will release a $ 25,000 (half price) electric car in 2023 . However, among experts, there were not few opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Tesla 2017 years junjunghyeong electric car ""model 3"" , 2020 years midsize electric SUV""Model Y ' after having released the, lays out a"" cyber trucks' electrical pickup trucks by the end of the year. However , the details of the'half-price electric car' that will be released in 2023 are not yet known.

*Elon Musk, chairman of Tesla, USA, is leading the global electric vehicle industry* *.* */* *AFP* *Yonhap News*  
On the other hand, Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology . Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates ( Over The Air ) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010 , and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system . However, due to various reasons, such as sluggish sales, in 2017 , Toyota's stake in Tesla ( 3.15%), and the alliance has ended. However, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyota was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

Headquarters manufacturing facility in Fremont, California plant Toyota in Tesla's original 1984 \~ 2009 years GM was creating a joint venture with the car's numi ( NUMMI New · United Motor Manufacturing Inc .) Was a factory. Toyota transferred this to Tesla in 2010 , and Tesla acquired not only a production facility but also a variety of production technologies from Toyota at the time.

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million units, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota CASE is focused on making (Connected · Autonomous · Share · All fairy tales) existing rotation careful to deal with (自前主義· to fulfill themselves) abandoned the herd (友軍). On the 24th , it entered into a partnership with a rival Japanese commercial vehicle company Isuzu to mutually invest 450 billion won. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022 . In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

Meanwhile, Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th , ""The likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%."" Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months”, an expression that could be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market cap is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of Apple, the world's largest market cap.

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year, and its share price continued to rise. It fell by about 30 %. Tesla, in particular , has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 units sold as of last year . If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.","['TWTR', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'GM']"

What was even more unexpected than the close was why—It was because institutions had to cover the short positions they had taken out for Archegos after the fund defaulted. None of the big players wanted to hold their positions over the weekend, and they all sold into the close causing a short squeeze that lifted all three indexes.

What this says to me is that the prices we’re looking at aren’t real. The valuations are so disconnected from the fundamentals that as the institutions start reigning in their risk, we will see things come back down to earth especially in more speculative sectors.

mgh94x,,StockMarket,post,1617114370,"ZKIN 15m OutlookThe price of ZKIN has lost few percents of it's value since the last outlook, as it's currently being traded slightly below $10 per share.

Yesterday's bullish divergence failed to find support at $10, and as a result of RSI falling below 40, a bearish momentum arrived. 

This bearish momentum was quickly capped as this dip atrracted buyers and the selloff was capped at $9.35 per share.

Unfortunately the gains weren't able to test resistance at $11 as they got capped at next pivot at $10.58, from where the bullish momentum has stalled.

As of right now, the price of ZKIN keeps falling, possibly looking for another sharper dip to the downside, that is most likely getting bought and a retest of $10.58 would follow.

Yet, the local low at $9.58 could have been the bottom, but there is no technical aspect to back it.

RSI is the one what concerns us about the price seeing extended losses as it's below 40, meaning bearish momentum is still present. A break back above $10 will get rid of the bearish momentum.

MACD is currently in a second selling wave while the selling pressure keeps increasing, as it haven't found peak yet.

The overall short term trend has turned into a downtrend as the EMA's are signaling.

As of writing this Outlook, the price of ZKIN has confirmed the bottom at $9.58 with a break above $10. This has also vanished the bearish momentum as RSI is back above 40.

As of right now, a move to pivot high at $10.60 is expected.",

Quick About Me: I am still a small time investor. I have only been in the market for about two years. However, I am a finance major and I am obsessed with the stock market. Take anything I say with a grain of salt. I'm always trying to learn and get better so *constructive* criticism is welcome.

# Very Quick Surface Level Lesson

When looking towards the future potential of a company you need to arrive at a valuation. Valuations do matter in the long term. Look at what has happened recently with companies trading on speculation and hype. Many stocks like this have lost months of upward movements in a matter of a month (including this stock).

One method of valuation is looking at peers. Below is a comparison of Corsair's closest publicly traded peers. I can expand on this further if anyone is interested.

&#x200B;

[Looking at this we can see that CRSR is discounted partially due to its  debt and lower profit margins compared to Logitech. Using Price to Sales  we can see that Corsair is the 'cheapest' out of these companies. Ignore HP that is not Hewlett-Packard.](https://preview.redd.it/9n5gxxd883q61.png?width=491&format=png&auto=webp&s=75240e2747d32199bf55aac1766a55eea1176621)

&#x200B;

Another method is to look at the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flows. The most important of these (and most overlooked) is the statement of cash flows. Each of these deserves its own post. If you plan to pick single stocks I would encourage you to become VERY familiar with these documents. I like to view financial statements quickly through yahoo finance (great free resource) or for more in-depth go to the company's investor relations page and download the company's 10-k which is a annual report. Almost anything you need to know about a company will be in its 10-K. It's overwhelming so start small and build your way up.

Risk is the name of the game and the only person that can decide what level of risk is right for you is yourself. Don't expect to pick names that are mentioned constantly online and expected to outperform the market consistently. 2020 was easy mode going forward things might start to become more difficult to make consistently high returns. Put in the work, have patience, and conviction and you will be rewarded. If you are interested in the stock market don't ignore risk because it isn't ignoring you. Take the time and learn how to control risk.

And for all that good in this world please quit going 'all in.' Always have extra ammo (cash). Build a position over time. If the stock keeps going up and you don't get a full position established... thats ok too. Be thinking ahead and don't let CNBC, the market, or you emotions lead you.

There's more, but if you don't already do these things before throwing your money in a stock than this is a great starting point. TD Ameritrade has amazing free educational resources on their think or swim platform. Even if you don't want to invest on the platform its worth making a account just for the courses.

and finally we get to....

# Bearish Points

· **Brand loyalty does not guarantee sales.**

a) Product reviews are most important, gamers prefer to buy their favorite brands, but will switch if another product is perceived as higher quality.

b) Corsair products are very highly rated on Amazon. If the quality of the products was to decline it would severely impact hurt brand image.

**10% of product sales come from Amazon**

a) Amazon sales have a 30% seller fee, decreasing margins on products sold. Corsair could benefit from selling more direct to consumer on their website.

· **High Interest debt could cause future financial problems.**

a) Corsair has a very high debt to equity ratio. Corsair has lowered its debt with IPO funds and net income showing that decreasing its debt is a priority.

· **Eagle Tree Capital, a private equity firm maintains a majority ownership in Corsair.**

a) Eagle Tree may use their majority holding to impact decisions that could hurt future growth, such as prioritizing margins over product quality.

mgidfd,,StockMarket,post,1617117557,"I Was Critical of Another User, and Learned a Truly Valuable Lesson in My Mistake.I wanted to take a moment to post a few thoughts on Onconova (ONTX), but we're going to take the roundabout way to get there.

Last night I made a post that was critical of another user, and very shortly after, realized that I was completely in the wrong.  First off, I was in the wrong sub.  Had the OP posted in r/GME, my criticism may have been warranted, but such was not the case and OP's perspective was totally justified for the sub to which they were speaking (r/StockMarket).

The original post is here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mg465a/did\_this\_sub\_get\_ruined/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mg465a/did_this_sub_get_ruined/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

(I have deleted my jackass comment)

OP was basically expressing the frustration over the now ubiquitous shill callers, collusion theorists and memers...all that fun stuff that perhaps used to be contained neatly within r/WSB that's been spreading throughout all stock related subs.  Don't let me paraphrase it though, I'm terrible about taking liberties in paraphrasing; original post was short and concise, and may be the sign post some of us need in order to get back to what we came for...I certainly needed to see it anyway.

Anyway, I received feedback from other users, pointing out to me that it looked like I was in the wrong sub - I was amazed by how kind everyone was, despite my blatant offense.  OP himself reached out and gave some advice, and I woke up with that on my mind today.  Those words really got to me, and I had no choice but to reflect on where I am, where I came from, and where I want to go from here. 

I've been investing on my own for about two years, building a structure of rules and guidelines for my own trades based on my successes and failures along the way.  Most of what I created I now know to be wrong.  I'd never looked to other investors to see what they were doing, I just figured I could come up with a winning method on my own.  You know that quote, I think it was Warren, something about the stock market being a tool to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient?  Yeah.  I had created a model that was basically guaranteed to help me transfer my money into the hands of the skilled and patient investors.

On January 28, I got interested in Gamestop.  I had never been a Reddit user before, but created an account when I started feeling like I just really wanted to join in on the conversation.  I bought 15 shares at $255. It doubled before the end of the day, and then I watched it tank for what, like a month?  I averaged down, now hodling 30 at $155 (sorry, I have to both hodl and call it hodling...you know, ape strong and all that).  In order to average down, I had to break the rest of my rules about being patient, buying low, leaving long investments long, not throwing good money on top of bad, and probably more.  I basically destroyed my model and jumped on the meme...but actually, this enabled me to take my investing to a new level regardless of how the current situation plays out.

The original plan was to let this thing do what it does, take some quick gains, and then take my tendies and go back to my regular trading model.  But when I was pinned down under those significant unrealized losses I had no liquidity to play with, so I invested some time into learning more about the market from redditors and pros.  My model had been destroyed for all the wrong reasons (apes, don't tear me apart for saying that, I'm not a shill and this is not FUD, it's fact - and I'm still hodling - but the way I liquidated my portfolio was a blatant infraction of my own personal guidelines). Despite this, I've learned about valuating companies, looking into sector patterns, analyzing volume to gain insight against share price, looking at level 2 data to get a feel for public sentiment, and so much more - plus I got the thrill of becoming part of the Reddit community for the first time ever, at the age of 37.

Ok, so Onconova.  This is the one thing I believe I had gotten right in my previous investments, but I'd love to see what others think about it because I am certainly still very much learning about all this.  On Jan 28, I had somewhere around 2-3 thousand shares of ONTX, purchased at around 80 cents.  I sold it all at a loss despite my convictions, just to get a piece of Gamestop.  After buying those first 15 GME shares, I put the change back into ONTX, picking up less than 100 shares for something over a dollar each...that hurt, thinking about what my original investment would have done if I'd just followed my own rules.  You can look at ONTX 3 month chart and see the potential gains I missed out on, but I'm personally still sold on the mid to long term value of this stock (my cost basis is currently around $1.40...OUCH!)

Remember how I said I tend to take liberties when I paraphrase things?  Everything I say here is subject to being an inaccurate paraphrasing, but I think I've got the gist.  ONTX is a medical/cancer research group.  They've got basically no debt.  They've got enough cash to complete the current trials.  They've been approved to conduct these trials by the FDA (approved late 2020).  Rigosertib and ON123300 are really exciting new products under testing now, but it looks like they'll be putting together a successful cytotoxic oral (cytoSTATIC - stops cancer cells from growing; cytoTOXIC kills those bitches right where they stand).  The company has ben around a long time and has released several other meds that are still in use today.  When they were trading around 60 cents, I saw a real value buy.  They're around 90 cents now, but have seen heights this year around $1.50, and I suspect they could go higher depending on the outcome of the trials.  There was a big sell off a while back when they had unfavorable trial results, but those results were inaccurate because they didn't account for the difference between terminal patients and non-terminal, so the ratio of patients who saw an increase in quality of life was relatively low.  As I understand it, when looked at strictly from the perspective of terminal patients, the evidence suggests a notable improvement in quality of life...so this med can help the people who have been let down by every other treatment.  

Anyway, this is the first time I've felt confident in sharing my thoughts on a stock outside of Gamestop.  I may be dead wrong about all of it, but I'd rather learn that than hold onto any more of my own homegrown dead end theories.  

Thanks to all of you for being so cool all the time, and to u/NeoGenMike for helping me re-broaden my perspective - your feedback really hit me.  This isn't what it used to be about for me, and although I still believe in GME, I must admit I had been swept away in all the hype.  Thanks for helping me re-ground myself...we're all going to need to get our heads on straight in the days to come.  The squeeze may or may not happen (personally, I think it will).  Long term value is certainly there, the sentiment shift has happened and the stock price just needs to catch up.  Regardless, I don't want the future of my investment experience to be centered around shill fear and memes.  GME has been fun.  I'm still stoked - and after this post, I'm going to catch up on today's memes - but this situation won't last forever, and when it ends it would be wise for us all to be prepared to go back to making investments like adults.  Although his enthusiasm may have helped generate hype for the GME memes, I don't think DFV himself would never invest in a meme stock - he's meticulous and skilled.  Many apes are going all in on GME (myself pretty much included, it's more than 80% of my protfolio right now), but DFV's portofio is well rounded...In all truth and serisouness, THIS is the way.

u/NeoGenMike, thanks for this call back to our senses, you've had a serious impact on my outlook and I'm grateful.  I'm really excited to get some liquidity back in my portfolio so I can apply all that I've learned and start getting back to normal investing.",['BEN']

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for anybody that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses to tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

TL;DR : Pitney Bowes is an ultra undervalued stock trading at fractions of their true worth.  
\- EV/Rev multiple sub 1x  
\- Ecommerce is alone worth at least $12/share

The overview:

[ Tech and growth company trading at deep discounts ](https://preview.redd.it/hdhp953ri6q61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f28d605e47ed07079d19817bb4774a924a1b185)

1. Debt is a hot topic with Pitney Bowes. But there is 1 commonly overlooked fact— Implied net debt is now at just $0.55B with $2.1B current assets. Pitney Bowes owns a bank where they provide financing at a very profitable margin. The implied financing debt is captured as part of their total debt. However, this is misleading. 

[ Reality check: Just slightly higher implied debt load than STMP \(\~$300M\) ](https://preview.redd.it/fhq8j20wi6q61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82c4c93d97c7e654a3a3b4f708fc502f52aa2b1)

 2. $PBI is trading as if it is going out of business. When in fact, their Freecash flow is more than abundant to continue paying down debt as well as reinvest into the business. The recent refinancing activities have completely mitigated the risks!

[ Take a look at that runway! Years of flat obligations ](https://preview.redd.it/iujzyizyi6q61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d45a698cd9a679900b10f81ed75148e38e8471e)

 3. The long turn around. Its no surprise, PBI has been losing money for a long while, with decreasing revenues. But this is not true anymore. They are growing rapidly and turning a profit, all in the height of the pandemic. 

[ From top line growth improvements to bottom line turn-around ](https://preview.redd.it/0nki09c7j6q61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=10bd4294b1e018558e75cfc0a3141801e06da5e6)

 4. Core transformation is now complete. Pitney Bowes have transformed their entire business for the long term. They are no longer just a mail meter company. They are a tech company, facilitator of commerce, and an outsourcing partner of the USPS (as USPS seeks to change, Pitney Bowes Stands to gain additional revenue)

mfza0y,,StockMarket,post,1617051221,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 29, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. 

Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. 

The United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). 

In other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.

Essentially it adjusts the repurchase price back to the original purchase price if you had repurchased within 30 days of selling.

Does the same rule apply for sales of a stock when you sell for a gain? For example if you sell 5 shares you purchased for $50 at $100 and 10 days later the stock tanks and you repurchase at  $10 and then it improves again and you resell at $50 does a similar wash sale implication apply?",

Cinnamon Toast Crunch in particular. A Twitter user posted a picture of shrimp tails in their box of cereal and it has gained some attention from others on Twitter and some new outlets. He also said he found a piece of string in the box and that the squares have something black cooked into them. 

Jensen Kerp (the Twitter user) has went and taken the squares to a lab to get them tested for rat or mouse droppings. At the time of writing this there has been no update about it. 

General Mills has been trying to help and said they are looking into it. They have also said “We can say with confidence that this did not occur at our facility”

What are the chances of there being more boxes like this and how do you think it will affect the company if these issues occurred at a General Mills facility?

mg4jtv,,StockMarket,post,1617067088,"Todays Market Summary 03/29 

We started off this week dealing with the fall out of a massive margin call that was executed in large part by [Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-blocktrades/global-bank-losses-may-top-6-billion-on-archegos-downfall-idUSKBN2BK0OR) to cover losses incurred by Archegos Capital when their leveraged positions with Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) went haywire. Bill Hwang who runs Archegos Capital had been acquiring positions in both Viacom and Discovery through highly leveraged swaps. The straw that broke the camels back was a [$3 Billion dollar equity offering](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/viacomcbs-stock-price-drop-3-billion-equity-offering-streaming-plans-2021-3-1030245725) by Viacom to fund their streaming business which caused a 29% decline in the stock price, which greatly affected the value of Archegos swaps. The losses proved to be too great for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley’s personal risk tolerance as they demanded more collateral from Archegos to cover their losses. When Archegos was unable to do so, a $20 Billion dollar liquidation was initiated as multiple banks forced closed Archegos positions in block trades. (Block Trades are large trades negotiated between a buyer and seller, usually institutional, that is done off of the open market.) [Baidu, Tencent Muisc, Vipshop Holdings, Viacm, Discover, Farfetch, iQiyi, and GSX Techedu](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sold-10-5-billion-155401799.html) all had positions closed and faced selling pressure as apart of the margin call.

On Monday, US banks faced a sell off of their own as investors grew concerned about losses they may have faced as a result of Archegos Margin Call[. It is currently being reported that the total global losses may be as large as $6 Billion dollars](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-blocktrades/global-bank-losses-may-top-6-billion-on-archegos-downfall-idUSKBN2BK0OR). Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.6%, Goldman Sachs dropped 1.7%, Deutsche Bank dropped 5%, UBS was down 3.8%, Creduit Suisse plummeted 14%, and Nomura suffered the worst with a 16.3% decline. Nomura warned in a statement that their loss may have been as large as $2 Billion dollars. There are rumors that one bank may have lost up to $4 Billion.

**Suez Canal Re-Open for business**

After being stuck sideways for nearly a week, the Ever Given container ship, which stands larger than the entire state building, has been unstuck from the Suez Canal. It was reported that the ship got stuck due to [strong winds from a sand storm](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/03/26/how-evergreens-ship-got-stuck-in-the-suez-canal/7010375002/). This resulted in many transport ships containing goods and materials becoming blocked as they were unable to travel to their destinations. It was initially believed that the dig-out effort could last weeks to get the ship unstuck causing many ships to detour around Africa to make it to their destination. It was estimated that [$400 Million dollars an hour](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/suez-canal-blockage-is-delaying-an-estimated-400-million-an-hour-in-goods.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1616702338) in goods were being blocked from entering the canal.

In the end, tug boats and dredgers prevailed and were able to free the ship from the banks which lead to the reopening of the canal. Shortly after the hashtag #Putitback started trending on twitter as some people seemingly wanted the boat to stay stuck for meme purposes. The unsticking of the boat had no immediate effect on the market as stocks remained mixed for the day. The S&P 500 closed nearly unchanged, the Nasdaq closed down .6%, while the Dow Jones closed up .32% for a new record high.

They believe, In line with increasing globalization, that there is a growing demand for access to credible company and employee information worldwide.
Despite the fact that Wikisoft's (WSFT:US) business directory system capitalizes on the freemium subscription-based version to use a service that far goes beyond the offerings provided by competitors such as LinkedIn and also Glassdoor.
Let´s compare Wikisoft, which is a relatively new company, with its peers and what they have accomplished:
Hired raised 132$ million since founding in 2012. More than 10,000 of the top companies using Hired and can save significant time screening their candidates. In fact it is claimed that it reduces the time to hire by 33%!
Glassdoor, founded in 2008 was acquired by Recruit Holdings for 1.2$ billion in May 2018. Provides recruiting solutions to over 7,000 employers – including 40% of the Fortune 500 companies.
Last but not least, LinkedIn (established in 2005) was acquired by Microsoft for a staggering 26.2$ billion. It is estimated that their channel sales consist of 3.4$ billion Talent solutions, 1$ billion Marketing solutions and 1.3$ billion subscriptions.
With companies in their growth phase, it is important to gather a lot of cash. This can be best done with dilution of shares. Wikisoft has filed a listing on the OTC stock exchange exactly for this reason.

Second of all how does short selling help anyone that’s in a stock that is overvalued. It literally just makes them lose more money even faster. It’s sickening that people mostly agree that it’s beneficial who trade stocks. 

The other one people say a lot is that it creates buying opportunities. Which is only half true. Often when a stock gets shorted its momentum gets severely crippled. So even if you buy the dip you will often make less money than if nobody shorted it. Also short sellers commonly short a stock when the chart is already in a dip and will short heavily when it is testing “support”. So people who are buying at a technically good entry point end up losing money to short sellers. 

Literally the only time it ever benefits anyone but the short sellers is when a big short squeeze happens. And even then the people who hold at the top of the squeeze are gonna lose money. And the stock will also be shorted again. So the shorts will still be taking advantage of people. 

I don’t see why people think it is healthy to have in the market. “It helps stop the market from bubbles”. Having bubbles in the market isn’t even a problem. And people shouldn’t be punished extra for getting themselves in that situation. And it also should not be incentivized for people to look for negatives in a company strictly for financial gain. And honestly we don’t need the shorts to do dd for us. 

Shorting is never good for anyone but the short sellers themselves. There are some times it does create an opportunity but it destroys way more than it creates.

It’s also unethical by nature. Especially when a short can borrow more shares than even exist. Not only that but they can borrow your shares and sell them while you can also sell them. So they are being sold twice... 

Fuck I absolutely hate the idea and it baffles me that anyone thinks it’s ok or beneficial.",
mfvshj,gspqf0q,StockMarket,comment,1617042357,"Legal short selling is fine and has been proven to be a net positive for capital markets.  The issue is illegal short selling, toxic and blatant stock manipulation.  Don't get trapped in the fallacy that they are one and the same.",
mfvshj,gspxv7v,StockMarket,comment,1617045755,"There is nothing offensive about the concept of short selling on its own. One person has stock and plans to hold it long term. Since he has no plans to sell it, he is happy to lend it to someone else to generate some borrow fee income. A long term holder benefits by generating lending income in addition to his long. 

Short selling improves liquidity. A long owner with no plans to sell is locking up liquidity. Lending that out to someone else who plans to sell it improves liquidity. 

Short selling improves confidence in the market price because both sides of the investor market are weighing in on whether the current price is an accurate representation of the company's true value. If only longs had input into the price, they would often overvalue the companies they invest in. This could lead to other problems like banks lending money to companies that are overvalued without the protections they might otherwise put in place if they felt it was overvalued. 

People who buy at support and get trapped by short sellers is not an issue. Anyone who considers themselves trapped by lines on a chart is a speculator. You have no proof that it's the shorts selling at support, rather than just long term holders that are finally giving up on the stock. Regardless of who is doing the selling, the buyers pulled back below the support. Anyone who bought in at the support has clearly misidentified the mood of the market. They weren't trapped by the shorts. They were trapped by the longs who stopped defending the support. This is one of the more ridiculous points you've made. 


The only really good way to properly factor in a negative case for valuation is to make people put their money where their mouth is. Without the ability to short, there is no incentive to call out overvalued or fraudulent issues. But even if there was a moral incentive, you would be unable to properly weigh hit pieces without knowing whether the person writing them believes in their theory enough to actually put their money on the table. 

Hedge funds do not have infinite money, whether for long or short positions. As we have just seen on Friday, they can and do get margin calls from their prime brokers when they go too far. 

The issue of short sellers being able to sell more shares than exist is a structural deficiency in the market and should be fixed, either with more accurate or more frequent reporting, or with bans on shorting after 100% are out short. 

Having bubbles in the market is a problem. It distorts the primary tool used to determine a company's value and whether they should be lent to by banks, or how banks should allocate their capital.  The free market value of shares is one of the best tools the free market has to efficiently allocate their capital among the millions of companies seeking to borrow money or seeking equity investment. 

Borrowing shares from a long term holder and promising to return them is not evil. There are systemic issues though when the same share can be lent out multiple times, and those do need to be fixed.",

When ZOOM went through an IPO. Some morons bought the ticker ZOOM, instead of ZM.

The price of ZOOM increased by over 100%. But, it was not for fundamental reasons, it was only because some dumb ass moron bought the wrong ticker.

Short selling would have kept the price more reasonable. However, short selling was not allowed on ZOOM, so the price took weeks to go down. 

Nobody made real profits out of it. 



(My opinion) 
Allowing short selling is fine. 

Allowing short sellers to do negative advertising so their short makes money, and brokers using different margin call rules for small and large funds, that's a real problem.",
mfvshj,gsqag20,StockMarket,comment,1617051558,"The three most common argument for short selling are:

1. **Yield enhancement:** Long term stock owners can make cash by lending
2. **Adding liquidity:** Enables buying selling for high demand stock
3. **Detecting fraud:** Shortsellers are incentivized to often uncover major fraud

All of the above are short sighted, unnecessary, and are more harmful than beneficial.

1. While lending might seem like renting car to Uber/Lyft driver when you are not using, or, renting out an apartment when not in use (i.e. putting asset to utility). There is no way of generating productive revenue out stocks other than to short-sell and bring the value of the asset down, totally unlike lending other assets.
2. Market makers and Specialists already have a lot of powers to inject and manage liquidity. The stock borrower does not have claims to dividends, voting rights, and is betting on asset depreciation to arbitrage. Anyone *parking* cash in low beta stock is basically double parking money with the original shareholder, and is actually taking away from price discovery of other securities, thus reducing market efficiency.
3. This is the most moronic argument of all. It's like paying mafia for protection because police are ineffective. It is not a investors job to dig up fraudsters, while governing bodies take business statements/audits on face value. Especially so, as detecting fraud requires highly skilled methods and techniques, not available to many investors. This is exactly what governing bodies that levy fees on the market to monitor, should do.",

mfztgy,,StockMarket,post,1617052648,"IS THE TIME TO BUY OCUGEN? 

There's a ton of DD on these already, so I don't need to say more. I want to analyze this from the position of political science and economics.

Let's start saying that I agree Ocugen is a very risky play because even if the data out there already suggests that it will be a cheap and effective vaccine, covaxin is ENTIRELY depending on getting approval in the US. There are several reasons to be bullish:

1. Biden is relying heavily on technocrats. That's why he doesn't say anything public - he does backdoor deals to try to get policies through, taking the load of Manchin and other centrists. Remember, Biden was in the Senate for decades and was vice-president, that's just him.
2. The technocrats are former Obama folks. Their BIG push right now is the Quad, which is a quasi alliance designed to contain China. South Korea and Japan are the weak legs - they hate each other due to history issues. India is the absolute key to the quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy
3. Covaxin is India's big Pharma play and they will push it with the other quad members if they want India to help balance China.
4. India is also one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines (generics). This is important for Modi's economic development model to get his vaccines in the West. OCGN will be able to produce a lot of vaccine for cheap. The problem is PURELY a bottleneck issue, will the US give authorization? I think yes since the Biden people desperately need India in the quad and Indo (Indian Ocean) Pacific (Pacific Ocean) strategy. Those Biden/Obama folks also have a bone to pick with Trump, and are all in on the science/vaccine train. They see no problem with increasing US supply. They don't give a shit about who makes the vaccine.
5. The US and China just had an AWFUL meeting in Alaska where China was basically talking shit for 13 minutes. US basically said, don't best against us - a threat to China. Of course, we still need phase 3 data. Until that's out, we just got to wait. But ALL of the geopolitics point to obvious reasons why there will be approval.",

mfxofg,,StockMarket,post,1617046830,"Market Commentary (the former Tiger Club member margin called, Volatility in the Markets, TIGR earnings) - 3/29/2021 

Hello investors,

Hope everyone had a great weekend.

Much has happened over the last couple of days and there's a lot to unfold. I'll start off with the last Friday's selloff and end with one final thought about the markets going forward.

Before we do, one thing to keep in mind as we think through what’s happening in the markets is the power of media.

I hear lots of media noise: changing opinions, shifting sentiments and rising calls for market meltdown.

And understandably so. I mean we are going through an ""unprecedented"" period with events that have occurred either very long time ago or never before: the geoplitical tensions between China, Russia, and the U.S., the new bond bear market, coordinated efforts by central banks and fiscal policies to stimulate the economy, the global pandemic recovery, and new flood of retail traders causing disruptions to the markets.

It's not hard to understand that trading these days is more difficult than at any other point in time throughout history.

Even the experts get it wrong all the time.

The smartest economists last year predicted that it would take at least 3-5 years to fully recover from the pandemic damages but the same group of people are predicting end of 2021 or early 2022.

Look at how the derivatives markets have incorrectly predicted fed funds rates in the past. By the end of 2009, the market was predicting the fed funds rate to increase more than 200 bps by 2011 and take a look at what happened.

📷

Remember back in March 2020 when the epidemiologists predicted that we will not have vaccines until 2023 or that 20 to 30% of the entire population will be eradicated?

My point is that in bad or good times, the ""media"", representing a group of experts in the respective fields, can present real hardships for us by playing with our emotions.

My personal strategy in dealing with the volatile market sentiment is to be very open-minded, listen to every word the experts have to say, especially their graphs or evidence-based arguments, form your own opinion, and do not be afraid to change your opinion if you've realized you got it completely wrong.

Doing your independent research and forming your own opinion is critical because by doing so, you will have a higher conviction in your trades.

Having conviction means you are holding onto the trade or stock when the stock falls 80% or not be tempted to sell when the stock triples.

You are able to do that because even if the stock falls 80% you know this company is a great business and you know it will quadruple in the next five years because it’ll grow its earnings and the market will eventually price to that.

If you do not have the conviction, then you’ll be questioning why is the stock falling and you will question your judgment and be tempted to sell.

Now onto today's topic.

I'm sure most of you have heard by now but last Friday, we had a hedge fund getting margin called, triggering large declines in stocks that the fund sold in blocks.

We need to first understand exactly what happened in order to know if this has any real implications for the markets.

This fund is called Archegos Capital, run by ex-Tiger Asia founder Bill Hwang. Tiger Asia is the Asia division of legendary investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, and Bill Hwang was one of a select club of analysts (the ""Tiger Club"") trained by Julian Robertson.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/billions-in-secretive-derivatives-at-center-of-archegos-blowup](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/billions-in-secretive-derivatives-at-center-of-archegos-blowup)

As a result of forced liquidation, the prime brokers that covered these positions also incurred losses, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and Credit Suisse.

With that said, as in any type of news, you have to make your own judgment in terms of whether the news is real or not.

I'm not saying the news is fake but I'm saying that it's probably impossible to know if it's 100% true because no prime broker will disclose the name of their client who just had billions of losses.

Practically speaking, does it matter if it was Archegos or another hedge fund? What matters for us is that some big fund most likely went bad and had to sell a bunch of securities. I wouldn't want to waste a minute trying to figure out which fund this was or whether if this story is actually true.

This fund sold $20 billion worth of shares in total, including ViacomCBS, Discovery, and big Chinese names like Baidu 10mm shares, Tencent 50mm shares, and VIP Shop 32mm shares.

📷📷

📷📷

📷

What exactly triggered them to liquidate all of these positions in such a strong bull market?

I would imagine it's the Chinese names and the growth stock selloff during the recent weeks. Look at their performances recently.

📷📷

📷📷

Viacom CBS went from $100 at intraday top on 3/22 to $64 low on 3/25, roughly 40% drop in less than a week. This came at a time when all other growth stocks were going down in flames, especially the Chinese stocks that took hit due to the rising geopolitical risks.

What does all of this mean for the markets?

Well, a few outcomes are possible in my opinion.

Bearish: full-blown market deleveraging, forcing other funds to liquidate and triggering a downward cycle and stocks to selloff.

Bullish: this turns into another September 2020 event where the Nasdaq sold off 10% caused by Softbank's bulk option purchases and the markets recover like it didn't happen.

Most likely, it'll be somewhere in the middle.

The reason I think it won't turn into a market mayhem is the same one I've been repeatedly mentioning for the past few months. Fed has literally promised a proper market functioning and fiscal spending is none like others in the past.

Look at Fed's dot plot for instance. They're as dovish as an institution can get, expecting to keep rates at 0% through 2023.

📷

Even if the market tumbles and the liquidity dries up, causing the S&P 500 to drop 15%, I have no doubt that the Fed will intervene to calm the markets down, which means the drop will only present incredible opportunities for us as investors.

**I am of the opinion that this is another one of those opportunities to buy into the dip.**

As I mentioned in this memo, I believe that this ""great rotation"" from growth to value will cause short-term stress in the growth names but not in the long run.

The reason is rather simple.

I don't think a company that's growing its top line at 30-40% with 80% gross profit won't care if the market rotates from growth to value stocks.

An e-commerce company will also be marginally impacted by vaccine rollouts. I mean obviously it won't see the pandemic-level of sales growth but I don't think an e-commerce firm that grew its top line at 25% a year pre-pandemic will see its sales growth decrease to single digits simply due to people not staying at their homes all the time.

The point I'm trying to convey is that if you pick great businesses growing rapidly, the market has no choice but to price them to their full earnings potential, whether the market rotates from growth to value.

We may see a lower than expected return but it's still a large return. For instance, if we were expecting Fiverr to trade at 10x P/S by 2025, then we may need to lower that projection to 8x P/S and our overall expected return may change from 250% to 200%. And I don't think you should reconsider investing in a company just because your expected return dropped from 250% to 200%.

On another note, I believe we will experience an inflation level we haven't seen in the last 40 years. The 10-year breakevens are already skyrocketing.

📷

My contention is that gold will be the primary beneficiary of this trend but I'm also open to other ideas to take advantage of the upcoming inflation blowout.

**The second topic I wanted to discuss is TIGR earnings last Friday.**

I posted my thoughts on TIGR on these two memos.

(see the comments)

They reported a very strong earnings report on March 26 pre-market and I was very pleased with the results.

Some of you may have seen that as soon as their earnings were reported, the stock went straight up more than 20% pre-market. After that, the stock opened 14% lower most likely due to the China tensions and Archegos liquidation of Chinese names, and fully recovered from intraday lows by the end of the day.

Given that the business is still in great shape with lots of potential, I view these drops as opportunities and I believe TIGR will thrive in the future.

It's certainly not easy to hold onto the securities that burn your portfolio. That's why everyone has different levels of risk appetite and one person's trading strategy will not work for another.

You have to develop your own system to manage risks. If you are not comfortable with a 40% loss, try limiting your exposure to riskier names or hedging your portfolio through options, as I mentioned in here.

Thank you for reading! I hope this helps and please feel free to leave any comments or feedback.

mfplkd,,StockMarket,post,1617024559,"Goodmorning Traders ... After the Squeeze is “squoze”... my 3/29/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY 

After the Squeeze is “**squoze”.** Can we stay up here at these levels? Some people call it a gamma squeeze, it has been popularized by gamestop traders as a short squeeze but they are one in the same. This happens when a lot of traders take one side of a trade (let's say short like the spy on Friday for example) and due to either time or lack of available shares on float, the trade goes the opposite direction causing a sharp jump in price because of short covering (which is the buying back to close positions). Team short covering with normal buy side activity and you have an influx of buying that causes the sharp price jump.  

   Time to focus on the real under currents in the market. We know the havoc that bonds and tnx are playing on big tech, However the place to watch for me now becomes the financials (xlf). Pay close attention to the advance decline lines of both the S&P 100 and S&P 500 by sectors. The only way we can maintain these price levels in the SPY is if both tech(xlk or qqq) and Financials(xlf) are positive. If both are negative, we fall hard, if they are both scattered across near 50/50 levels we consolidate for a while with the 390-area becoming the trap door. The one disturbing thing to pay attention to from Friday is that for the first time in a while we had correlation, although it was to the upside it is still correlation. Let's look at the possible outcomes for the day:1) we hold support at the 390 area and we consolidate between 391 and 395 area building energy for breakout move higher or lower. 2) we break support of 390-389 and all pops back above can be shorted for a longer period. 3) we hold support above 391which begins a journey to retest 400.  

1) we hold support at the 390 area and we consolidate between 391 and 395 area building energy for breakout move higher or lower. **45% probability**

Edit: not that it's hard to find but here's some financial info.

For the year ending December 2020, Vizio reported net revenue of $2.042 billion, up from revenue of $1.836 billion in 2019 and $1.780 billion in 2018. Device revenues of $1.895 billion increased 6.9% driven primarily due to a 17.5% increase in Smart TV shipments as states across the U.S. enact stay-at-home regulations to curb the coronavirus spread. Likewise, Platform+ revenues increased 132.9% on the back of advertising revenue expansion and SmartCast active accounts increasing from 7.6 million in 2019 to 12.2 million in 2020.

The company recorded net income of $102 million in 2020, up from net income of $23 million in 2019.

Ok... I think we might have our multi-national insolvency event that kicks off a whole bunch of other unintended consequences:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhHdtDyQD90

This shit includes: 

- USA via Bluestone Resource's bad loans (involving the governor of WV and his spawn) and Katerra, a Softbank interest and  US ""construction tech"" company (as Patrick says...""whatever [the fuck] that is"").

- India via GFG Alliance (a *family* ""office""); nobody is really talking about the web of companies this family office runs in India, but that probably because doing so is life threatening.
 
- Australia via Lex Greensill and Greensill's need for IAG (Insurance Australian Group) to re-up 4.6 billion of credit (re)insurance.  IAG is apparently on the hook for Katerra... uh... I mean, Softbank's debt despite having their refusal to provide insurance to Greensill unadjudicated.

- Germany (vis-a-vis the EU) via Greensill Bank (used to be Nord Finance Bank) and German municipalities who put millions into that bank since it offered better than negative interest rates.  Further, this bank was used to obtain letters of credit that allowed Greensill to further perpetrate his wider, more global frauds with the massive help of GFG Alliance, which kicked of the German banking regulator's audit of Greensill (Wire~~fraud~~card anyone?)

- Switzerland via Credit Suisse's 2 billion dollar loss in this fintech catastrophe. 

- Great Britain via Greensill being allowed to operate as a quasi-bank outside of FCA regulation/authority and receiving half a billion pounds worth of COVID interruption ""loans"" (yeah, I put that in quotes for a reason).

- Japan via Softbank and Tokio Marine who might experience up to a 7 billion dollar loss to do underwriter exposure limit overreach.

Greensill's total debt liabilities (incoming and outgoing, remember, they're nothing more than an over-glorified factoring shop) stand at ~150 billion in financing in *2019* (probably more with COVID stimulus provided to them) spread over a mind numbing 10 million customers and suppliers.

My take on this is that it is so multi-national, with such an undefined final resting place for the massive, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shill debt, that no country will allow the debt to land in their jurisdiction.  In the decade plus that it takes this thing to unwind, the debt produced by Greensill will cause a cascade of insolvency that no central bank will be willing to accept on their balance sheets.  Fundamentally, this is a story of counterparty risk.  Typically these types of love triangles are hard enough to bring to a conclusion in a single jurisdiction.  Given the fact that we're taking seven or more jurisdictions, this unknown orgy of counterparties is going to be dancing in court rooms around the world for the next decade while the world burns down from the insolvency of 10 million businesses who used Greensill.

This is going to be a huge black eye for the fintech industry.  Everyone involved in anything outside of missionary position style finance should expect regulatory repercussions (that includes cryptocurrency folks).
 
In short, I think we found the next John Law and his name is Lex Greensill.

So, in closing, now that we see this shitstorm on the horizon headed in our direction, how do with make it worse in a way that allows us to profit?",

Is there a strategy to average down if you cannot use anymore margin? For instace, if there is a big green day, should I sell off all my margin, and then buy it back on a red day?

mfqfu6,gsppsj7,StockMarket,comment,1617042075,"    This is my first time in margin, and I have no idea how to get out of it.

Add more cash to your account, and stop buying equities until you pay off your margin debt. Based on your responses to other people in this thread that have provided advice, you seem to be pushing back and are searching for a quick fix by adding more risk (selling on a ""green"" day and buying on a ""red"" day). 

    The stocks will just not even get close to where they were in price.

Yes, you're right about this (in the near term). Not only are growth/tech stocks in a correction/pullback from a major bull run from 2020, we're also currently in a rotation from growth stocks to value stocks, the market is fearful of ten-year bond rates rising too fast, inflation/CPI rising too fast, and as of last week we're having rising cases of COVID even though our vaccinations rate is rising (potential extension of COVID restrictions). This is why you don't overleverage yourself with risk. 

    Is there a strategy to average down if you cannot use anymore margin? 

You want to fix your mistake of taking on too much risk by adding more risk? You have unrealized losses, and you're trying to ""revenge trade"" or ""double down"" on a bet you gambled? If you want to get out of margin debt, your strategy should be:

1. Stop buying more shares until your margin debt is $0.
1. Start transferring every available discretionary dollar you have now and in the future into your brokerage account until your margin debt is $0.

&nbsp;

After you clear your margin debt:

1. Don't lump sum 30% of your portfolio into margin again. Do it incrementally, and slowly. Don't YOLO.
1. Keep a limit of maybe 10-15% of your portfolio in margin. Don't YOLO.
1. Have a plan to execute should the market tank while you're in margin debt. Don't YOLO.

&nbsp;

You learned a good/hard lesson, but the damage is not insurmountable. Don't make this more worse than it already is. Good luck and best wishes!",

mfqfu6,gsp3zxx,StockMarket,comment,1617032174,"A couple of things here:

1) Margin is best used for diversified, lower volatility portfolios. Using margin on a highly volatile portfolio like that which you describe comprising three stocks is asking for a margin call. If you get margin called, your loses will be ""locked in"", because you will not have leverage in the recovery (that is, if it comes -- which is not guaranteed).

2) You are doubly exposed to interest rates increases, which would likely both especially hurt your growth stocks and increase your margin interest.

You don't say what your current portfolio exposure is. I suggest you re-calculate what drop you could currently handle without being margin called. If you think that drop is plausible, then sell down until the drop is unlikely. Unfortunately, with your portfolio, a very large % drop is plausible.",
mfqfu6,gsp4kl5,StockMarket,comment,1617032440,"You already switched from investing to gambling, now you're wondering if you can double-down after you're out of money?

No. Spend the money on a counselor. I'm being serious. Don't feel insulted.

Get the heck out of margin if you get the chance, and stop using it. It is a headwind that puts your investments at risk under a wide variety of market conditions that would otherwise be tolerable.",

I'm a long term investor, but as of late, I haven't been feeling very faithful in the future of the US. 

My fears mainly consist of: 
- The possibility of the dollar losing its reserve currency position.
- Sky rocketing national debt & consistent trade deficit. 
- The rise of China & emerging economies, possibly leading to a shift in global economic power from the west to Asia.

mfzos1,,StockMarket,post,1617052302,"So I have this money...For 22 years the only investing I have participated in is weekly automatic contributions to my 401k. I am well diversified there and I adjust my allocation and future deposits every January. It has grown nicely. 25% of the balance is my contribution. The other 75% is profit sharing and gains. I’ve always thought that it will not grow enough for me to retire comfortably before I’m too old to reap the rewards. Then along comes Covid and the CARES act. I was able to withdraw a large sum (I’m not sure if I should say amounts, I made a Reddit account a year ago but just started using it) without an early withdrawal penalty and the option to spread the tax out over 3 years, which I’m doing. I paid my credit cards off and a personal loan off. I did not pay my mortgage off because my payment is low and I felt like this money could serve me better elsewhere. I put it in CD’s, half for 9 months and half for a year. I made a little bit but couldn’t help but to think that there’s got to be a better way. So after thinking about it and having this money for over a year I decided to buy my own stocks. I hold savings account with Ally bank , I really like Ally, so I decided to use their investment platform. I initially put 25% of my money there in late December. Then another 25% in January. Also in January I put the remainder into crypto. 
I have learned a lot but now I am second guessing my decisions. Would I have been better served just leaving the money in my 401k since I just put half of it right back into the market? I do have the option to put my money back into my 401k. I didn’t really know anything about crypto but I took a chance. When will I ever have this amount of money to invest again, was my logic. I want to take advantage of this money and use it to its fullest potential. I want to invest in a way that will allow it to outperform what it would have otherwise done had I left it in my 401k. As far as the money I put in the traditional market, my timeline is 10 years. I would love to hear what successful investors here have to say. Tips on diversification, dividend stocks, ETFs, etc.",
mfzos1,gsqmblh,StockMarket,comment,1617057393,"There are two key resources I would like to point you towards:

One is r/personalfinance's ""Prime Directive"" resource at  [commontopics - personalfinance (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) .   This describes exactly how best to manage funds so you have some throughout all of the stages of your life, including what to pay off when.   The r/personalfinance reddit is also good for Q&A about things like ""should I pay off my house early"" or ""should I take money out of my 401k"".   On the common topics page, there is also a flowchart which is helpful.

And, in relation to investment strategy:   I'm a big fan of putting almost all my money into a ""three fund portfolio"" as described in various places.    This means putting some of it in a US-stock-market index fund such as VTI which holds pretty much all the stocks in the USA,  some of it in an international fund such as VXUS which holds pretty much all of the stocks not in the USA, and some in a good quality bond ETF like BND.

This is commonly refered to as the ""Boglehead Philosophy"".   Bogle was the guy who came up with the concept of index funds, and also was the founder of Vanguard.   Bogleheads hang out over at r/Bogleheads.   There is also a good 'getting started' page at  [Getting started - Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started)

I'll just add a little more about the Boglehead philosophy:   It's largely based on the proven fact that most people can't beat the market on a long term basis.   In the short term, yes, but long-term, even the most skilled financial advisors tend to not outperform the market.   As a result, the three fund portfolio is designed to meet market returns while minimizing risk by diversifying very widely (as in diversify across \*ALL\* stocks, not just a few).",

mf5n4k,,StockMarket,post,1616953027,"FYI: Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in ‘unprecedented’ block trade selloff – mediaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly sold $19 billion worth of shares in Chinese tech and US media companies. Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. 

Continue...

“I’ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,” portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg. 
Senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move “highly unusual,” adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.
Another issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with “forced deleveraging,” the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don’t know “whether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.”","['VIAC', 'MS']"

Looking at the current Archegos Capital event, let's assumed that they are shorting Gamestop and got squeezed, and got liquidated. (no evidence indicating they are at this point, let's make that clear)

&#x200B;

I added a position into Beyond Meat recently and I thought I’d throw my two cents out there. Here’s my bullish case for the BYND.

https://preview.redd.it/ctlkl3i91vp61.png?width=2914&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39e6679d6bbfc34905a90e003646ebab0b588d7

Beyond Meat recently announced some pretty sweet partnerships for the next few years. A big win is with McDonald’s for the McPlant burger. They will be the supplier for the plant based menu item for the next three years. This could possibly open the opportunity for other plant based menu items there as well. BYND will also be teaming up with Yum! Brands. There will be plant based menu items offered at KFC, Pizza Hutt and Taco Bell. This is a great opportunity for Beyond Meat to reach more customers. Last year, they announced a unique partnership with Dunkin’ Donuts and Snoop Dogg for the Beyond D-O-Double G Sandwich.

Beyond Meat also announced recently that they’re going to be expanding their products within Walmart as well. They are currently in more than 2,000 different Wal-Mart locations already. Last year Beyond Meat announced partnerships with both BJ’s Wholesale and Sam’s Club. So, now not only do they have a strong presence in the fast food industry but they are now carving out a spot for themselves in the retail space as well. Beyond Meat is in about 25,000 retail stores across the US. This includes companies like Target, Whole Foods, Kroger, Publix & Sprouts

On top of all that, earlier this year Beyond Meat announced that they would be partnering with PepsiCo for plant based products offered by the company. There’s only speculation as to what this could be but it’s just another avenue for Beyond’s customers to get hands on their product.

Personally, I think we’re entering into the age where synthetic meat and meat alternative products are an everyday thing. They only get better over time and as the flavor increases so will the customer base. Beyond Meat has already established a trusted brand and they have many customers to show for it. With these partnerships listed above it creates an opportunity for a lot of growth in the coming years. 

The market has been pulling back recently but BYND has stumbled since late January after announcing the Pepsi deal. It has brought the stock down and away from overbought levels. This tells me there is some room for growth in the price and that we may see more money flow coming in. This is definitely a longer play here. I plan on holding this for at least a year but will re-evaluate every four months just to make sure it’s still a right fit. ","['YUM', 'WMT', 'KR', 'PEP']"

I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market.

I am sure that this is a good business if Intel can be price competitive as there are only two world class fondries, TSMC and Samsung. Moreover, if I understand it correctly they do have unique technologies which are a couple of years away from production. Once that happens Intel will likely be ahead of TSMC whose technology is licensed from Intel. 

This will also allow them to reduce their chip cost as their fabrication facilities might have economy of scale.

On the other hand, it is possible that they won't be cost competitive, TSMC will remain ahead of them on tech curve, or the new plants will suffer execution hiccups (not totally unlikely).",['INTC']

mgkwis,,wallstreetbets,post,1617124331,"GME is about to breakout and I think this is whyHello Apes and hedgies, this is my first attempt at a TA and i will be utilizing technical indicators. 

So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xxc0xape67q61.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f67f9e4a093ae8d67ebf00095811fbd4b43522

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v1hs1l3t67q61.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=78546e0cb8cdbf23b62b9cedb4c7518ec212e314

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ae0zxgk377q61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ce4b7b779155d92aa6f8fb4a1c43c7b68a58fd6

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. 

This is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. 

TLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon

Edit: The yellow line is the MACD line and the red line is the signal line. When the MACD line crosses it upwards the momentum is up meaning price increase. Obviously vice versa on a downward cross.",

CCI(20) dipped to -200 and quickly topped 230; volatility is picking up from the past hour, with volume up from noon as well. Usually GME has stalled out on low volume past 11am-noon so this is a good sign. Hoping to close around $190, last time we closed above $190 was 3/18.

**Update 1:12pm:** Volume has picked up and the [price has spiked](https://imgur.com/a/Qbob22C) to $195. A breakout point in the channel would be around $197-$199 in the next 10 minutes.

**Update 1:45pm:** With the support being tested multiple times and the quick shoot upward at 1:10, it was beginning to look like the trend within channel had been broken. However, it seems as if the support is still holding as it dips right now. Expecting a reversal and upward trend in the next 10-20 mins because of the very negative CCI.

mgkfxt,gsthfh5,wallstreetbets,comment,1617123314,4 million isn’t even worth a headline. So incredibly low. No real consequence,
mgkfxt,gsth0xy,wallstreetbets,comment,1617123131," Europe's top markets regulator fined Moody's Corp . for breaching rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest with its largest shareholder, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc .

The European Securities and Markets Authority said Tuesday that it fined Moody's units in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain €3.7 million, the equivalent of $4.4 million.

ESMA has special rules related to companies that own more than 10% of credit rating firms. The ratings company can't issue new ratings for companies in which such an investor is a board member or a major shareholder. The rules also require certain disclosures on existing ratings of companies in which such investors hold 5%.

Berkshire Hathaway is Moody's largest shareholder, with 13% of its shares, according to FactSet.

Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

""All the breaches were found to have resulted from negligence on the part of Moody's ,"" ESMA said. The regulator said it was crucial for ratings companies to ""eliminate or manage and disclose conflicts of interest to avoid interference by shareholders with the rating process.""

Moody's had ratings on units of Powergrid Holdings, a U.K. power company, and Munich Re , a German reinsurer, in which Berkshire Hathaway owned 10% or more or had a director, ESMA said.

In 2015 Moody's rated a £150 million bond, the equivalent of $206 million, by Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) Ltd., the regulator said. Berkshire Hathaway was represented on the board of the unit and owned more than 10% of the capital or voting rights at the time.

"" Moody's Investors Service is pleased that this matter is closed,"" a Moody's spokesman said. ""We are committed to the integrity and independence of our ratings and to complying with all regulatory requirements.""

The largest part of the fine—€2.7 million—was for Moody's U.K. operations. ESMA said it found 206 instances for 65 rated entities where the U.K. unit didn't provide appropriate disclosure regarding shareholder conflicts of interests. The regulator found 72 such instances at 36 rated entities at Moody's units across France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

https://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd

Next we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.

https://preview.redd.it/q3zpnefo06q61.jpg?width=445&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=105c93ad369eb22f1fc9a3dda9fae387ddece542

Whoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.

**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**

https://preview.redd.it/88priavp06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ffa27aa5b2950f90bbd91369ff900b002465bf0

Michael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart

https://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0

Using my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.

2 hours later...

https://preview.redd.it/pc771x6u06q61.jpg?width=1643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a78ccd799c49944de9ec2e02960e800253fb79c7

look at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.

&#x200B;

**AFTERNOON  15:00-16:00**

https://preview.redd.it/oaq044xy06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f03aa90bb5daf00d99b911f88c697c34430c1aa

For those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his 🍆 chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY

https://preview.redd.it/3hha25f016q61.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a44d401e72b863c90fff719775e7bfd60019acc0

Yep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close

https://preview.redd.it/q5l5m3j116q61.jpg?width=1640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c866e21ff30b2bb117e09df144a5ca82089af1cf

And like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.

As Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?

**Remember, if you can't trade profitably using TA. you have to be either lazy or stupid or probably both** 

Tune in next week where we will be reviewing the differences between a Crayola and a Wonder Stix and how each will effect your trading style.

mfxfuo,,wallstreetbets,post,1617046195,"National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveragingThis is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

mgh8kt,,wallstreetbets,post,1617114323,"$AAL - The American Airlines Degenerate Gamble - AAL Trade ThesisWhat’s poppin’ fellas, hope you’re all doing well. I’ve got a short little trade thesis that I can’t get out of my mind due to how odd it is, and was looking for some second opinions on it. Reposting this due to it getting removed yesterday.

&nbsp;

In my spare time, I’ve been working on a few tools to help me with my trades. I’ve been working on a program similar to CheddarFlow, which analyzes a shitload of options data, performs various forms of analysis on it, and then alerts me if there’s anything funky going on which could help net me some easy cash. Earlier today, my program notified me of [this order](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809296545936965642/826183106280554556/e436fbf7bcda456a57af24d40e19487d.png), which I found really odd, due to the entire nature of it. $50,000 worth of 0.04 cent AAL options hitting the wire expiring this Thursday. This trade alone isn’t that crazy since it could’ve been made due to a multitude of different reasons, but shortly after the order was caught, I got alerted that [government officials](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/826220503492067368/5c6356221adb7155516c01780601cb6f.png) were also picking up shares of various airlines.

&nbsp;

So now, things are interesting. We got crazy volume on an obscenely stupid OTM AAL call option expiring this Thursday, alongside government officials swallowing shares of various airline companies. What do we make of this? Does somebody know something? I’m not entirely convinced that this isn’t a crazy coincidence, but the contracts are literally the same price as a scratch ticket coming in at 4$ a pop, so it’s not like the overhead cost to play is that high.

&nbsp;

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn’t find anything. What the fuck is going on? **If anyone has any ideas, theories or relevant helpful information on the topic, please share!**

&nbsp;

**I’m not trying to bullshit anyone, this trade is likely gonna go straight to 0 well before Thursday rolls around.** That being said, coincidence or not, the circumstances surrounding it are quite enticing. To those traders who are addicted to FDs, or have cash burning a hole in their pocket and want to YOLO on something, I feel like this trade is the one to go with. For the same price as a scratch ticket, this trade provides us with comparable odds.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out  - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for any Apes that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses too tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

Save a copy to your google drive and then there is only 2 inputs - Simply change the date (UK Format) to the 1st of what ever month we are in and change the Ticker (yellow boxes) everything else is auto

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation & Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*

&#x200B;

*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Relevant tickers are likely due to those companies being direct GameStop competitors [https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop](https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop)

&#x200B;

While that is certainly a possibility, more likely is the fact that these are GameStop's four main competitors in the E-Commerce video game space. In order to talk about GameStop's success, they will need to talk about the plan to compete with these giants.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'BBY']"

However, I've not seen too many posts drawing attention to the price of the golden arches being used to gauge market confidence. America's favorite drive-thru restaurant is FUCKING HUGE, and world wide, and even if Hedgie's blow up the market with financial fuckery, investors can always trust in the ice-cream machines working! **THAT DOESNT MEAN BUY IT NOW!**!! It still falls like everything else, BUT let's see how it compares to the overall market...

Below I've provided a comparison to MickeyDee's against the S&P 500 going back to 2015.

[Edit: Added a Yellow Question Mark because Ape's like more pictures](https://preview.redd.it/qn1gcag0j2q61.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=e258647aa0a0080dd90d4d1a8d0239bf850e6a3e)

By the comparison you see that when MickeyDee's rises a significant amount, outside of it's given trend, we see the market dip pretty soon after, usually within 2-4 weeks.

Some people that finished high school argue that it's due to investors not being sure of the economy and wanting to hedge their bets. Think of it like investing in gold when shit hits the fan, only it's the Golden Arches.

And something about investors finding cyclicals, but I still haven't found my wife's yet.

If you zoom into July you could also argue that it did/didn't predict a slide in stocks, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other 4 times so I left it out.

*""Does this mean I should go buy puts on everything?""*

Hell if I know, market might go through the roof for the rest of the year. I'm posting on WallStreetBets, not The WallStreet Journal, so that should convey my ability to deep throat crayola's.

&#x200B;

mg7div,,wallstreetbets,post,1617076745,"Alright I just going to say it because no one seems to have gotten to the point. Lots of RKT shares were bought at 25.25. Give me a rational reason to be bearish.Ok 2 things - very simple. 


1. MS sold out of 1/2 billion dollars  of RKT at 25.25. Why they sold? They probably have a set plan so sell in increments at set prices, they are rotating some money around because of margin call shenanigans, or they want to keep accumulating at lower prices so they made a public scare. 

2. The closed above the 8, 20, and 50 EMA on the 4 hour chart. Last time it did that we saw 70% gains. 

Ok 3 things. We know they will beat ER again and drop some partnership again probably. They are going to get recognized as more than a mortgage company because they can make money when rates are up and down due to their tech. Next Er should prove this. 

I can’t seem to think as to why this sell by MS is bad.

On a more macro level, you could say consumer lending stocks could dip hard I guess. I don’t believe this matters. Not only are they not just a mortgage company, but they are a safe play even if they were only a mortgage company because of their ability to utilize tech in high rate environments. Additionally, MBS’s are actually crash proof now IMO, especially with RKT’s securitized loans. (They write clean loans which get sold as a portfolio in the secondary market.) People pay their mortgages as a priority, and it’s not pre Dodd Frank Act anymore so you actually have to qualify thoroughly.  

Ok, let’s say everyone losses their job and can’t pay their mortgage and RKT goes bankrupt... The funny part is we would probably get over $300 a share due to the amount of assets they have. It’s comical, that’s literally how undervalued this company is - According to the stock market they are worth more bankrupt then being fully operating business generating nearly half $1 trillion in revenue in one year (according to their annual report) while rapidly growing/innovating. 

I can’t seem to think as to why this sell is a bad. At the end of the day someone bought the shares above 25 while the price sits at 23.8.  

Pos: 2k shares and a total of like 250 calls or something - I lost count. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.

Edit: 1/2 billion dollars not shares",['MS']
mg7div,gsru7i5,wallstreetbets,comment,1617083434,"One minor observation is that lending companies have definitely loosened their lending standards ALOT.

Two examples. First of all 4 of my neighbors sold their homes in the last year.

Home 1 sold for $295/sqft. Home 2 sold for $274/sqft. Home 3 sold for $363/sqft. Home 4 sold for $391/sqft. All these houses were built at the same time, homes 1, 3 and 4 have identical layouts. Home 2 was larger but had differed maintenance. Conditions were similar, home 4 was the nicest condition, but still a 30 year old home. 

Brand new construction is $286/sqft MAX.

Anyone notice a problem? Why is a 2000 toyota tacoma with 100k miles worth more than a new one? HINT: it isnt.

But what has happened is appraisal creep has distorted real value. Here is what happens. A home sells say market value of $200/sqft. The next appraiser says $210, and the next $220 and on and on. And eventually we get to overvalued homes. Which we are at now. 

The lenders are just doing their job, the buyers have great credit, good jobs, good economy (if you have a college degree in something useful), so what is the problem? These people can pay their mortgage!

Ok, but what happens when rates rise and their home is now worth $280/sqft and they bought at $380? The cash price of things matters. I don't really understand why lenders are ignoring this. But then again, I didn't understand it in 2006 either.

Buyers are buying a mortgage payment, not a home. They cannot afford their home, only the payment and only for now.

2nd example. My friends just got approved for a mortgage. They make $82000 pre tax combined. The gurus say they should buy a home for about $285-325k for about 1/3 of their income. But they were approved for $460k. Well over 5x their income.

They have perfect credit. They won't after they buy a home @ 5.5x gross income and any life event happens.

This is predatory lending. But to people with good credit. To fuck up a hot economy, greed just...finds a way.",

mfvovp,,wallstreetbets,post,1617041531,"What Morgan Stanley's offering of RKT 20m share block at $25.25 meansMS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

1. VIAC  owns Comedy Central. Think Chappelle Show, Saturday Night Live, etc.  They also own spongebob square pants, rupaul show, show time, reno 911,  MTV, and many more.

2. Selling  $30 billion of shares in 4 days is too much too fast and a 50% correction on VIAC is not justified.  It takes a few days to weeks for most \*less than the brightest\* to do math, communicate, and realize the price is super low. Wells fargo says it has finished liquidating to meet the margin call.

3. VIAC did a $3 billion offering while it was over extended up at $100 per  share and they now have \~$3 billion more cash than DISCA does. This is a chad move and a rare opportunity for them to acquire or build something  incredible--I'm not going to speculate as to what, but I'm confident they will do something dank.

This fucking guy had 5:1 leverage on $16 billion of capital invested in china growth/tech *at the peak of the fucking tech surge*, and *didn't fucking de-leverage* during the most obvious sector rotation ever 6 weeks ago. It's all gone now. Liquidated. To zero. He was heavy into china tech / growth stocks on 5x margin, $80 billion portfolio. Poof. 

Margin calls probably started on Monday of last week, where forced liquidation took place. Rumor has it, all of the different PB's this guy borrowed margin from agreed to an orderly selloff during the forced liquidation, but some unknown PB front ran them like a total cocksucking wench and liquidated all at once, causing a violent crash in BIDU and Viacom.

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company’s platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.

“AbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what’s possible,” said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 


**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB**

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)

mfr62k,,wallstreetbets,post,1617029309,"Palantir (PLTR) is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is why.First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. 

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. 

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  “We are going to deliver the world’s best software with the world’s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that’s worth to them. And I think you’ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.” -Karp the day they went public","['FB', 'PYPL']"

Blackrock and Vanguard also happen to be the two largest holders of shitco $PENN (Blackrock owns 12.5% while Vanguard holds 9%). Now I believe that this stock was ponzi scheme from the beginning, given that it ran up 1500% based on no fundamentals and a significant loss in income.

mgite3,,wallstreetbets,post,1617118796,"ABCL DDFirst time post, but wanted to bring more attention to a biotech stock that I personally love.

ABCL is not a biotech company, nor is it a pharma company. They want to be both, they want to make data, make drugs, make new scientific discoveries, they want royalties, partnerships, research. This company has huge plans and is in the right spot financially to make it all happen.

Check out their earnings:

ABCL [(Link to Earnings)](https://investors.abcellera.com/news/news-releases/2021/AbCellera-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Business-Results/default.aspx) TLDR its fucking massive, its a phenomenal report. 800 million on hand with Little debt with the debt at 0% interest. *0. F'ing. Percent.* [(Link to pretty color ppt from earnings call)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/359178033/files/doc_presentation/2021/3/AbCellera-2020-Business-Update-(March-29-2021).pdf)

ABCL has huge potential to become a **massive juggernaut** as a biotech/pharma company.

Their antibody discovery platform allows them to rapidly discover therapeutic targets and push them into preclinical development. This is best demonstrated by the development of Bamlanivimab, where the antibody went from unknown to discovered product to clinical trials in **60 days. 60. days.** Typical drug development takes years on average and they had a covid drug in clinical trials by the summer of 2020 after starting discovery efforts in late winter.

Let me start a new paragraph and reemphasize this shit ***60. F'ing. Days***. Thats the definition of industry disruption, to introduce a new product that drastically improves and decreases development time is huge. I fucking snorted the crayons (orange you tards any other flavor isn't worth the time) out of my nose when I saw this, full disclosure I work in the industry and we can't fucking match this.

And since I know most of you can't read, here's a couple bullet points your partner's girlfriend or boyfriend can read to you tonight:

* ABCL 2020 Annual Revenue was $**233,155,000.**
* ABCL 2021 Q1 Project Revenue from one income stream AKA Bamlamni-60fuckingday-cumfasterthanyourpreeteen-vimab is a minimum of ***190,000,000, more likely over 200mil.***

Their projected 2021 Q1 revenue is essentially their whole entire year in 2020.

Now during the earnings call one investor had a decent slightly stoopid question of what about when COVID is over. Ladies and Gents sit down and shut up. COVID is projected to be endemic for the decade if not forever, it is here to stay. Which means COVID drugs are here to stay and here to generate money. The CEO made sure to point this out, also that ABCL is not a fucking COVID company. They many projects in different fields of therapeutics (oncology, animal health, nerve regeneration, etc) and they acquired a company called Trianni last year. A humanized mouse model company that OTHER companies will use for research and drug development.

&#x200B;

If my retard summaries above weren't enough check out the historical short volume data. If you wanted squeeze potential, ABCL might just have a bunch of lemons so find some fucking sugar, ice cubes, and water. Might just be drinking some lemonade on the porch of your 100 year old dilapidated Southern Style farm house porch  of a home that you bought with 5% interest with a waived inspection and no DIY skills to speak of.

I like the stonk. Not a financial advisor. Just a smooth brained amc holding ape.

mgite3,gst8vbu,wallstreetbets,comment,1617119486,Appreciate the DD. I was surprised to see such a positive earnings. Most biotech IPOs have shit financials and highly speculative. I'm looking to buy in after it stabilizes a bit after the report.,
mgite3,gstc9vh,wallstreetbets,comment,1617121008,"Revenue was higher than expected but earnings was much lower.

The risk here is on COVID - where the vast majority of their revenue relates to. It is unclear to me how their revenue will fare once the disease is under control.",

Edit: for those saying you can do options in an IRA, it was a 401k. I only converted it to an IRA this month. And yes, I am now enabled for selling covered calls in the account. Thanks for helping me keep a factual account of the events.

Edit3: yes, i get it, am a trading unicorn. Thank you for all the messages. I won't have time to reply to them all. This has been a lot of fun. I will definitely make an animated timeline of all my trades over the last few years and maybe some explanation of why I invested the way I did. I think that will probably answer most of everyones questions vs. replying directly.",
