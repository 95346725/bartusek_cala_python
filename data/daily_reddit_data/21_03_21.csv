Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen became a billionaire thanks to insider trading. How is he not in jail? On top of insult, he bailed out Melvin Capital* and is allowed to buy the NY Mets. 

FRONTLINE documentary link:
[To Catch a Trader](https://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-catch-trader/)

I finished watching this Frontline documentary and was flabbergasted to learn that only the people working under him were found guilt and sentenced to prison. In one instance, Steve Cohen literally tells investigators that although he opened an email with insider information, he didn’t pay attention to the screen right before executing the criminal trade! 

This pisses me off because most of us on Reddit are investing our hard earned money one day at a time. We are doing it honestly and are still getting better yearly returns than Wall Street. These guys are playing with house money, cheating, breaking the law and becoming billionaires.

I'm 27 and I work in the mining industry (Chile) with 14x14 turns, so I want to make some money while I am in my two weeks off. 

A month ago, I invested around $12.5k in ETFs (90%) and mutual funds (10%) and I'm planning to hold for 15-20 yrs while I add $400 a month from my salary (around 2.4k).  My personal expenses are around $1k considering rent, food, health and sports, so I have some bucks that I'd like to trade.

Right now I'm trying to educate myself by reading A Random Walk Down Wall Street (Malkiel, Burton) and watching videos in youtube (The Plain Bagel, Investing Made Simple and New Money) and some podcasts.

Please any advice, personal experience or other would be truly appreciated before starting this walk.

m9wazq,grp9rwf,stocks,comment,1616335675,"If you're interested in actively trading coupled with a more passive approach, I'd suggest to start with a very small allocation of your capital.

As you're doing research through books and videos, you should be trying to develop an idea for a trade strategy. I won't go into detail, but you'll essentially want to know how you'll execute your trade before you even think about buying shares in a company, or whatever you're interestedin trading.

Most people take many months or even years to refine their strategy, so expect a lot of evolution as you learn and grow. Don't expect to learn everything you'll need to know in books/videos. Deliberate practice, review, and refinement of execution can be a great teacher.

Some people might suggest paper trading initially until you feel your trade strategy can produce a consistently profitable outcome over a long enough timeline. That may work for some, but everyone is different psychologically. The risk of losing play money may cause you to become loose with your rules since there's no real world consequences for mistakes.

Above all, be pragmatic with your approach. Although some people have generated huge returns in short periods of time, I can assure you that these people are true outliers. Trading shouldn't be seen as a means to get rick quick. 

Enjoy the process of learning. Take things slow. Only trade an amount that wouldn't cause your emotions to override your logic when unexpected events take place.",

m9zkxi,,stocks,post,1616342207,"Ark Invest Price Target - WtfThese “projections” are wildly unrealistic.

Honestly, a freshman is college should be able to tear this “model” to shreds. 

42B for a human ride hailing network: Double Uber/Lyft combined on a service that they don’t even have a business model for? Using on Tesla’s vs all cars on the road in the case of Uber and Lyft? Doubling the size of the ride sharing network while driving Uber and Lyft to 0 in 4 years? 

Insurance: 300% more profitable than Progressive, State Farm, etc? 24B from essentially nothing in 4 years? Nobody in insurance has 40% margins for a reason. It’s not because they don’t know what they are doing like the Tesla fans would like you to believe.

Growth: 80% revenue growth compounding. On a company that grew 14% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 despite still being a small company where larger growth rates are possible? Elon himself hopes for 50% growth, which in itself is pretty unrealistic as the company scales.

Autonomy: Did anyone watch that Oakland video? This software is years out. Assuming by some miracle it was achieved by the end of 2022 (unlikely at best), that would give them roughly 2-3 years to scale from nothing to over 300 BILLION in revenue. You know, bigger than Apple and around Amazons size. 

I could go on for days. It’s insanity.

Personally I see Apple and Amazon with the highest upside at the moment. Microsoft and google coming close. 

For me, Apple having a 2t market cap where half their revenue is from a single product (iPhone) means they have a lot of potential to increase revenue from other streams. For years people have been saying people will stop buying iPhones and apple continuously proves them wrong. I believe they will substantially increase their revenues in 2021/2022 with their new Mac chips. They have a very loyal customer base and it’s very tempting to buy another apple product once you’ve become accustomed to one of them. Product line up is still relatively small so plenty of room to grow there too. IMO we could see 3t market cap easily this year assuming no catastrophic macro economic events. 

Amazon and Microsoft arguably have a better business model than apple. Plenty of revenue streams and margins are great.

The first risk is share price drops below your strike price and you don’t buy at the bottom. However, if you want to sell the puts, you are willing to pay the strike price minus premiums, the risk is even lower comparing to buy the shares outright.

The second risk is share price recovers before expiry and you just receive your premiums and miss potential profits if holding the shares.

If you really want to get the shares, sell ITM puts instead, since the intrinsic values are included in the premiums, so you are not missing anything.

1. Electric motors contain cobalt.... look up to see how its processed who processes it and you'll see it's a dirty dirty process and not awesome countries to deal with.

2. Lithium...same as above plus Incedibly dirty to recycle.  Rare earth metals.  If China decides to cut supply...uh o spaghetti o.

3. The power grid. Current projection is even with major renovations the power grid is inadequate at best for just standard usage . Thats not including charging your 2.5 cars every night. 

3a. The power grid. Where does said power come from. Natural gas  power plants nukes? Solar without a breakthrough is as efficient as its gonna get. Battery power is at its limit without technology breakthrough.

Electric motors do not contain cobalt that I'm aware of.  Copper and iron.  I think you are thinking about the batteries which do contain cobalt.  Electric motors are beautifully simple machines.  They contain far less parts than an engine and will last much longer than them.  The vast majority of cobalt use comes in consumer electronics like the cell phone tablet and laptop you upgrade every 6 months.  

The lithium batteries are not great, no.  Manufacturer are looking at steering away from cobalt.  The Lithium itself is not a very environmental friendly process no, but it's comparably less than oil refining over long term.  The other thing about lithium batteries is that they're just the best we have right now.  The motors in these cars will far outlast the batteries which could in future be replaced with greener and more efficient technology.  If we had of spent the last hundred years developing battery tech instead of internal combustion, we would be a lot further ahead than we are. 

As for the power grid and production sources, well that too can just get better over time.  Infernal combustion is stuck at where it's at.

Point 3a, for one thing: Solar may not be getting considerably more EFFICIENT but it's been getting, and continues to get, CHEAPER. Efficiency is ""power out/power in"" which used to mean ""what you get/what you pay for"". But sunlight is free. Meanwhile, using US utility-scale numbers, solar was [$4.05/watt](https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/us-solar-market-insight-report-q1-2011-120627093305-phpapp01.pdf) in 2010 and about [$0.80/watt](https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-2020-q4) in Q3 2002 .

When Citadel pays Robinhood for order flow and you want to buy 100 shares of AAPL at 120$ or better (limit order), Robinhood will route your order to Citadel who will when buy 100 shares of AAPL for fractions below 120$. It will then sell you your order for 120$ and pocket the difference. It also uses the data from order flow to strategize against retail investors in its own investments. That's how Citadel makes money from payment for order flow.

However, as a designated market maker, it also maintains inventory of AAPL stock and profits off the spread between the bid and ask size.

So, as an example in my mind (Note, I have no clue how the algorithms are actually implemented), if the market maker algorithm sees that there are plenty of incoming bids for AAPL at $120 (every 5-10 minutes), then the algorithm can decide to buy (bid higher quantities of shares) as the price dips further below $120 and sell higher quantities to divest of excess (profitable) shares as the $120 target is approached.","['TGT', 'AAPL']"

Mar. 16, 2021 5:59 PM ET by **The Sound of Money** (as seen on Seeking Alpha)

Summary:

* Rite Aid has a growing retail pharmacy business generating over $15 billion in annual revenues.
* RAD owns a Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) service, now known as Elixir, currently generating an additional $8 billion in annual revenues.
* Comparing revenue to market capitalization of RAD to both Walgreens and CVS shows a significant upside to RAD's stock price.

Rite Aid is a stock that has been trampled on in the past. Even now the stock has a much lower market capitalization than its main competitors, CVS and Walgreens. One possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand. What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.

An estimation of how such an approach might play out will start with a valuation per store. In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store. At an average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand). Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand. Even though many of these stores are in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store. The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of $1.2 billion, if $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.

ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion. During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of 23 - 29%. ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (beginning March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million. Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year. With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings. Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results. However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is almost 2X the closing price of $25.70 on Monday, March 15, 2021). The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry. With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.

Another comparison to the revenue and market capitalization of Rite Aid to direct competitors shows that Rite Aid's revenue is approximately 16% of CVS and Walgreens, yet the market capitalization of Rite Aid is less than 2.9% of Walgreens' market cap and only 1.4% of the market cap of CVS. Either both Walgreens and CVS are extremely overvalued, or Rite Aid is significantly undervalued from a revenue vs market cap comparison with direct competitors.

Before the failed merger with Walgreens and the reverse split in 2019, Rite Aid had more stores but also held more debt. The sale of stores to Walgreens and the lower debt created a smaller company roughly half the size it once was. Since the deal was valued at approximately $10 billion, $9 per share pre-reverse split or $180 in today's share price, you can see that Rite Aid shares were valued at a much higher multiple than today. A $5 billion market cap, estimating for the much smaller company Rite Aid is today, would still command a $90/share stock price. Why then is Rite Aid only trading for just over $25/per share?

Of course, there are risks with any investment scenario. Rite Aid has a large amount of debt, presently over $3.2 billion according to their Q3 earnings presentation. Every quarter, their interest expense is slightly over $50 million. This could easily grow larger and produce an even higher net loss per quarter. Rite Aid is also experimenting with a new store design concept. It is still unclear whether this new store layout will draw more customers into the stores or just be a significant remodeling charge with no real benefits. Rite Aid is also not a nationwide chain anymore. It is doing battle against two much larger chains who both have a nationwide presence along with more cash and market clout. To truly become successful and acquire positive earnings, Rite Aid will need to draw significantly more people into their stores and sell higher margin goods and services. The next earnings call and forward guidance, estimated as falling on April 15, will shed light on Rite Aid’s plan and whether the reorganization is working.

In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just over $25. The purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward. (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully intact.) Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario.

ma2gyz,,stocks,post,1616350491,"DD Valuation of the Next Tesla: Grossly Undervalued bubble stock in the making (VOW3, VWAGY)I'll split this DD valuation on Volkswagen into two parts: the Value Play and the Next Tesla Play.

VOW is the actual European stock ticker.  VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.

[Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales and Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025.

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020.  As of March 19, its price-to-sales ratio is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues is €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less cleaner vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, should be worth *at least* €111.0 billion.

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $42 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should be €181.2 billion.

The EV top-up of €111.0 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €292.2 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been $67.70 yesterday, folks!**

The Next Tesla!  Volkswagen!  Das Auto!

m9djig,,stocks,post,1616266438,"Uranium, the cycle has turned and the next phase is on the horizonI wanted to bring you all another post on the uranium sector after the massive run up we have seen in equity prices over the past few weeks. A lot of people have been worried about this run being unsustainable, because of a lack of movement in spot price. Others have pointed to it being blind speculation that will come to an end soon. Neither of those things are necessarily true in my view and these will be addressed in this post, together with a host of other things.

Recently an interview came out by Smithweekly on YT where he spoke to perhaps the two brightest minds in the uranium investing space, Mike Alkin and Timothy Chilleri, in a two hour long gem of information on the uranium sector. After watching the video and talking about it with a lot of different investors, several of them found it to be relatively hard to follow and take in because of the duration of the video and technical terms in it. Because of this, I have written a summary of this interview that is found below, which is a lot less than 2 hours and hopefully it can help people pick out the most important aspects of it. I would most definitely advise you to watch the entire video even after reading this though, as it can be a great help in such an opaque market. Without further ado, here is the summary:

**First and foremost, fears of the financial markets today:**

It’s a very interesting time. The view on the market is the case for a potentially weaker dollar, which would square with where we are in terms of commodity prices. The prices are moving up, but the valuation between the two asset classes is stretched, with equities being extremely high. Play in the things you are comfortable with, the markets might feel ‘toppy’ right now due to all the tech fueled growth, it might continue but no one knows. Sometimes it is better to be in the parts of the market with less eyeballs on it and where things are less priced in. Timothy, who likes his coffee the same as Mike (and Andrew, important detail), focuses on cyclical industries/commodities currently. Things like gold miners who are now paying back debt and have a lot of free cash flow, again, with less eyeballs on it. If you go to plays where others won’t be, it is easier to have an informational edge and gain value, because the moment other retail investors and especially institutions come in, a lot of the potential upside won’t be there anymore.

**The view of a long runway in the bulk of the commodities:**

This is certainly the case. Uranium doesn’t have real price discovery on a regular basis. There is a terrible futures market that is out there, which is so small it is insignificant. You have a cohort of buyers, which is the electric utilities, and there are \~60 of them around the world. Lastly you have a few traders who trade some pounds back and forth, which don’t really influence the market. Right now, nuclear is catching an ESG feel to it, the fact that we are more focused on fighting climate change and we need nuclear power for that. Uranium mining gets swept up in that as well. Some people also look back and watch the commodities, especially with a weaker dollar. Once they have their eyes on the market, those people will likely see the opportunity so many of the people already investing into uranium have. Although this is all attractive, it doesn’t play a part in the base thesis of Mike and Tim. In their view, in terms of the best performance profile, there is nothing that comes close to uranium. Should we see a March like crash? It will be a like a gift. Having said that, the commodities market as a whole is very interesting. We need all the basic resources and after years of underinvestment, these cyclical commodities are coming back into favor. Markets will prove to be cyclical, as they have always been.

**Let’s talk uranium:**

First off, the supply side risk. Certainly one year ago, late January 2020, all focus was on the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. Because of that we saw several C&M decisions to go down, both from Cameco as well as closures in other jurisdictions and the pause of wellfield development in Kazakhstan. Very few people expected it to ‘drag on and drag on’, but today with Cigar Lake on care and maintenance, the risks remain out there. This has been highlighted for a few years now. It might not be fires and floods that take a mine offline this time, but who knows what might happen tomorrow. There are also mines closing permanently, like Ranger and COMINAK this year after some 50 years of mining (taking approximately 7 million pounds off of the market). This is already factored into the market, but those are still real pounds coming off of the market that will need to be replaced and with Olympic Dam not expanding for now, it is not clear where those might come from.

These pounds will need to be replaced. Why? Because demand is inelastic and there is no substitute. These utilities need uranium. In the last bull market these utilities had drawn down their inventories and if you look back to that period of time, you had much higher supplier and producer inventories, with lower utility inventories. These are, when all put together, lower today than they were back then. You can’t exclusively look at utility inventories and come to a conclusion purely based on that. The prevailing sentiment at that time, was that buyers didn’t believe there was a need to buy, they had been burned before and wouldn’t move based on merely the promise of the market improving. The ingredients for a massive bull run were in place: low inventories and underinvestment by suppliers. Exactly what we see today, but the difference is that we have a better demand story now and no new mine supply coming online.

This supply deficit can be seen when one would try to buy pounds off of the spot market in any given month several years ago. You would probably be able to find 15 million pounds, but today if you want to find more than 1 million free flowing pounds, you would drive the price up. Traders know this as well, the fact they can’t secure a large amount of pounds. Talks for security of supply are happening right now. The stage is set for a tug of war. Producers are not blinking and it is all part of the cat and mouse game, but this can’t go on. If utilities don’t start contracting like yesterday, they are hosed. They are going to be paying prices significantly higher than they need to be paying. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, supply is low, demand has improved and no new mine supply is coming online. Since 2013, on average 35% of supply was contracted and they are sitting there with enormous uncovered needs over the next couple of years. Don’t pay attention to day-to-day fluctuations, do the math, the opportunity is there and the horse has left the barn because utilities overplayed their hand. Some are playing it smart, like the smaller more nimble utilities, but the bigger ones are taking their time and will need to wake up soon. When one or two do so, it will likely be a stampede.

You know what is not going to make a difference? US producers tagging an extra million on maximum production capacity or Brazil opening a 4 million pounds a year uranium mine is not going to make a difference. We need more price discovery and if we don’t go to 50-60 dollars a pound, those mines won’t come and those pounds won’t be available.

**View from inside the industry:**

What does one see after 20,000 hours of research? Consensus is inconsistent. Most buy and sell side models are not up to date, causing inconsistencies in the views of the market. What also doesn’t help utilities get ‘ahead of the curve’, is that the fuel buyers in question don’t have any financial incentive to go ahead and lock in supply at certain prices. They don’t get anything extra for timing the bottom perfectly, nor do they participate in the financial upside. With no rewards for saving a fortune, you often see that most fuel buyers follow a herd like mentality. They won’t get penalized if they pay more than what they could have, as long as the peers are doing it. They won’t get fired for paying more to secure pounds, they might just get fired if they fail to secure any security of pounds for the utilities.

One of the big mistakes people make in this sector. Is being so focused on ‘uranium’, U3O8, without really understanding conversion, enrichment and the broad fuel cycle. There are bottlenecks in this fuel cycle and we are finally coming to a point where we can move into the U3O8 market, because all this stuff further down the fuel cycle has been sucked out. Activity is going to pick up and this will result in a reaction in the prices of U3O8. Being well passed peak underfeeding, the next stage is coming over the next 6/12/18 months.

What about mobile inventory? Something so many are worried about? At the moment, bottlenecks in the conversion market are still being solved. Questions like: Is there available UF6 stock? Can I convert my U3O8?, are common and these bottlenecks will need to be worked through. U3O8 is the last place they will go, but underneath the surface a lot of things are happening. Don’t keep staring at the price, the fundamentals are there, stop worrying about day to day noises in a broken, dysfunctional and inefficient physical uranium market and trying to make sense of it. If we really had all this excess supply, prices would be dropping like a rock.

**China’s role in the thesis:**

They do not have a lot of indigenous uranium production, which is why they search for it elsewhere and make investments to secure supply for all the reactors they need to construct in order to meet the carbon neutral goals by 2060. They think in terms of decades and all these inventories that they have will never see the light of day. They are strategic and necessary for them. They are playing the long game and want security for every single reactor and a 400 million pounds stockpile, over the long term, is not a lot for them in the grand scheme of things. They are buying up all sorts of commodities and this should not be underestimated, so don’t stand on the sidelines looking in while the commodities macro thesis is playing out in front of everyone.

**Mistakes and unexpected events:**

It is hard to realize how reliant the sector is on third party consultants. Having to spend so much time analyzing other people’s work, is an area that wasn’t really forecast. As facts change, consensus numbers change as well. But this doesn’t necessarily happen in this sector and it wasn’t until a deep dive into the sector, that a ‘wow’ moment came. The math is extremely compelling and it cannot be outrun. When will this happen? Could be tomorrow, but it also could be the end of this year. Point is that the math is in place and human nature doesn’t change in these cyclical industries, they will chase the price when it starts moving.

When Converdyn went down back in 2017/2018 and they were out securing conversion, to do that they would go and buy UF6. Converdyn would have U3O8 laying around and the amount of U3O8 equivalent in that UF6 is returned to the seller. Some of the people that took this U3O8 back in, don’t need it, so they blow it into the market. In this period there was more supply and it was just a ‘ricochet event’ in the form of people getting U3O8 to lock in conversion and blowing it back into the market, which brought some supply. It was never forecasted, but we have worked through those inventories and now we are on the other side of this. Headwinds are turning into tailwinds.

Don’t make the mistake holding on to your shares too long. It’s part math and part art. You will see a lot of things happen, including crazy multiples and FOMO. Keep your eyes on the goal and keep evaluating and re-evaluating your investment thesis and put the puzzle together when situations change that might alter the outlook. There will be a time to sell, as you will always see with cyclical industries.

**Proper analysis and projections:**

Let’s talk about the difference sort of companies in the sector, the exploration, development and production companies. Exploration is hard, the success rate is not great, but there are possibilities to be had there. There can be monster returns to be made here, but it is a lot more risky, so keep that in mind as it can be a tricky part of the market. This is however not what has priority, the priority is in finding the mismatch in the macro. This is where you can look at some of the producers who can get back into production and will have cash flow, which can attract new investors to these companies. Then there are some development companies with world class assets where the market will probably just pay a premium when the cycle turns, because the asset is just too good.

For projects to come online, a lot of things have to go very well in the macro market. When this happens, the stocks of the underlying equities will probably have already re-rated and the current opportunities that are available today, are likely not going to be the same risk/reward proposition at that point. It pays to be early.

\--------------------------------------------------------

That marks the end of the summary of this great interview. I wholeheartedly agree with Mike, Tim and Andrew on this one. The math is in place and the thesis looks to be playing out just like it was expected. It is still relatively early in this bull run so for those worried about missing the entire run up, we have not been anywhere near a top in this market in my view. Can we see a correction after such a massive run up? Of course, but in my opinion these corrections and dips are useful buying opportunities. Make sure to do your own research and build conviction.

ma1vvk,,stocks,post,1616348795,"Is Iberdrola getting overlooked by the market? Why is there no premium like for other clean energy stocks?Hi  guys & girls of r/stocks, this is my first comprehensive DD. I work as public  policy consultant for energy transition and believe that finally, their is no doubt left that wind, solar and hydro have won the energy game and will come to dominate the power systems at least in the countries with good potentials and high governance, with the rest at least  achieving high renewables penetration levels. A look at Orsted, Vestas,  Siemens Gamesa, even GE suggests many investors think that too. However,  Iberdrola might be a company with very little premium to pay for its  future potential. From what I gather, it’s very well positioned, well  managed, profitable, and its vision of where the energy sector is going  corresponds very well to my own.

**From insidermonkey.com:**

Iberdrola  has grown to be the number-one producer of wind power in the world. The  official website of Iberdrola also boasts its high installed renewable  capacity. With the value being over 31,000 MW, Iberdrola is regarded as  one of the cleanest in the energy sector. The company supplies energy to  over 100 million people across several countries, its subsidiaries  including Avangrid in the USA, and Scottish Power in the UK. Iberdrola  has also made a commitment to “reduce its emission intensity to 50  gCO2/kWh globally by 2030, thus achieving an 86 % reduction in three  decades, in addition to being carbon neutral globally by 2050.

So is it a buy? Here's my breakdown, let me know what you think.


**Metrics (2019 and 2020):**

- PE ratio: 19.88 (very reasonable compared to other companies in the renewable / clean tech business)
- Share price went up 22% YoY as of March 21st 2021 (again very  reasonable all things considered) – please let me know if I’m missing  something and we haven’t seen Iberdrola go the way of say, Orsted
- Assets: 122 billion EUR
- Liabilities: 35 billion EUR of financial debt; maturity comes in at  between 3.5 and 5 billion EUR yearly up to 2025 which seems should be  easily manageable (I can’t find the word “liabilities” anywhere in the  report – please let me know if I’m missing something – as stated below,  Iberdrola owns 5 nuclear plants in Spain where the decommissioning bill  should be due in the period between 2027 and 2035)
- Over 1 million EUR revenue per employee (more than e.g. Microsoft)
- Operating profit margin of 16,6% (IMO very, very good for a large and  diversified company in the middle of a complex pivot to new  technologies, business models and regulatory frameworks)
- Pay-out ratio has been around 70% of the net attributable profit in recent years, translating into \~5% dividend yield


**Leadership:**

- José Ignacio Sánchez Galán – CEO since 2001, executive chairman since  2006; also holds roles with JPMorganChase, World Economic Forum and two  other organisations; visiting lecturer at two universitites; received a  ton of awards in his career and seems well respected
- Francisco Martínez Córcoles – Business CEO since 2017; also member of  the Board of Directors of the Spanish  Electric Industry Associatio
- Aitor Moso Raigoso – Director Liberalized Business since 2016
- Armando Martinez Martinez – Director Network Business since 2018
- José Sainz Armada – CFO since
- Xabier Viteri Solaun – Director of the Renewable Energy Business since ?

All  in all, this seems a very experienced team with experience from the  power industry and others (banking, finance …), with lots of trained  engineers who’ve come to hold top management positions. Quite some  recent appointments. It’s all rather old white men, so zero points for  diversity, not sure if that matters in this case.


**Ownership structure:**

- Qatar Investment Authority 8.69%
- Blackrock 5.25%
- Norges Bank 3.43%
- Wikipedia also cites Norges Bank, Kutxabank and Bankia as large shareholders, but that info might be outdated

So all in all, very diversified ownership structure. Not sure that’s good or bad.

**Some important subsidiaries:**

- Scottish Power (UK)
- Avangrid (US)
- Neoenergia (BR)


**Market position and outlook:**

- Strong presence in some markets with high renewables potential (and  sometimes a favourable market environment) - Spain, UK, US, Mexico,  Brazil
- Likely the biggest  renewable power generator in the world (although I couldn’t find a  source confirming this); the biggest wind power generator in the world;  strong presence in the power grids segment; also present in power sales  and energy services segments
- One of the cleanest power generators with ca. 60% renewables in its portfolio
- The rest of Iberdrola generation portfolio is mostly combined-cycle gas  power plants which is the only fossil-based generation technology that  makes sense in decarbonising power systems for the next 20 to 30 years;  only trace amounts of coal
- Iberdrola also owns 5 nuclear plants in Spain with 3GW of total  generation capacity, which could come with a substantial decommissioning  bill when the power plants reach the end of life, but that should only  be between 2027 and 2035
- Iberdrola intends to double its clean generation capacity by 2025 by  investing 75 billion EUR; considering some of its shareholders and  generally positive environment for clean energy, financing shouldn’t be  an issue
- Iberdrola has also made  decisive strides into offshore wind, including floating; investments  are planned on storage business which I also think has some potential;  the importance of digitisation is stressed; on the other hand, Iberdrola  is entering green hydrogen business cautiously which I think is smart  as I think a lot of hype right now is only that


**Bull case:**

- Iberdrola continues as the biggest renewable energy major, maintaining  leading position in onshore wind, expanding its solar and grids  portfolio, while not bleeding too much cash with gas power
- It makes a splash in the offshore wind and successfully enters the  green hydrogen game, all of that while staying nimble and digitising
- That leads to increasing the turnover while maintaining high revenue  and profit margins, maintaining the dividend yield while substantially  increasing the market cap


**Bear Case:**

- If I had to find one, it would be that multiple of these possible  developments materialise concurrently: Iberdrola starts losing market  share in the onshore wind, never manages to become a major player in  offshore wind, gets wrong-footed by regulatory changes in the grids  segment, overreaches on hydrogen, and starts bleeding cash in the gas  power segment
- Oh and it becomes  apparent in the next few years that the Spanish nuclear plants  decommissioning bill due in 10 years or so will be huge and no one’s  thought of setting aside funds for this over the last 40 years (I should  check this, actually)
- IMO, none  of these developments on its own is very likely, some are actually very  unlikely, but overall, we should expect at least one or two to  materialise


**TL;DR:**

All  things considered, Iberdrola seems like one of the best bets in the  clean energy sector that is very likely to grow. It’s well positioned in  the key segments such as onshore wind, solar and grids, and has hydro  and gas power assets to provide backup power to it its variable  renewables portfolio. It also has a very good position in the nascent  offshore energy wind segment with huge potential, and if hydrogen  becomes a thing, there’s no reason Iberdrola shouldn’t be a player. Its  gas power plants might be a minor liability but also might be a net  positive. Iberdrola is well managed and should have no problem financing  its ambitious investment plan that aims to double its renewable energy  portfolio by 2025. It has 3x as much assets as liabilities, and debt  maturation in the coming years is in the range of EBIT which is very  comfortable. All this says BUY.

Selling options is very annoying because Webull will lock your options abilities the moment your account goes negative, and it can go negative quite often because it takes 5-7 days for funds to be transfered in and Webull gives you ""buying power"" during they time.  So if you have 0 cash in your account and you transfer $1k into it, then buy $5 worth of stock with the $1k ""buying power"" Webull has given you until your funds settle, you will be locked out of Options because your account is technically -$5.",

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
> The bond market’s reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell’s briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
> “This is bonds’ — I wouldn’t call it day in the sun — it’s more like day in the tornado,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “Clearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that’s not the case.”
*****
> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “The bond move has been huge, and it’s starting to scare people,” said Schumacher.
*****
> “There’s been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?” he asked. “There’s no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It’s incredible.”
*****
> # Powell speaks
*****
> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
> # Inflation and the Fed
> There is also some key data.
*****
> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank’s forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year’s numbers when prices fell.
*****
> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It’s a change to the Fed’s ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
> “For the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there’s a consensus problem. There can’t not be tension,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> “They will be trying to clarify the Fed’s message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,” she said. “They will be explaining themselves as economists, and they’ll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.”
*****
> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
> “The market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed’s dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,” said Grohowski.
*****
> “Yet, they’re committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,” he said. “That’s what the market is struggling with. I think it’s unsettling to me to hear words like ‘overshoot.’”
*****
> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‘great rotation’ from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
> “I think we’re in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It’s not over, but I think we’ve seen the lion’s share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,” said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed’s willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike’s comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
> “Inflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,” Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year’s earnings.”
*****
> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed’s economic forecast.
*****
> “If you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It’s too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,” Grohowski said.
*****
> # Bond market direction
> Schumacher said there’s a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

> # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One
*****
> “The stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.” Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard
*****
> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick’s Day! We’ve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here’s to some more today and over the rest of 2021.
*****
> One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ’29 crash, the ’87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn’t do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we’ve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we’ll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
> So what happens now is the logical question? “The good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although it won’t be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls’ side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.”
*****
> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
> “Global growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators” according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “When we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.”
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “The level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country’s below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country’s relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January’s 0.5% pace.
*****
> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI’s value.
*****
> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite’s growth, while manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.

> “In recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.”
*****
> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

Does anybody have experience with Chase You Invest? I'm invested in some volatile stock and was wondering if I'm in a safe place assuming a squeeze occurs. My concern is in regards to limits/blocks on selling if the price explodes. From my understanding, Chase You Invest did ***not*** block the buying of shares during a squeeze late January 2021, which gives me the idea they're a safer bet than most.

m99wgz,,stocks,post,1616256048,"Treasury Bonds, why should we care?I’m going to start with a very brief overview of Bonds and how they in turn affect stocks. Then I will pose some questions for discussion as I do not fully understand how this will affect the market. 

When you buy Bonds you are buying US Government debt. The Yield is how much interest the Bond pays. Yield is determined by supply and demand of the Bonds. When the Pandemic hit people apparently flocked to Bonds because they are a safe investment and this buying drove down the Bond Yield. The Bond Yield causes other interest rates (mortgages, loans, credit cards) to follow its rise or fall. Since the Yield went down so did interest rates, this caused a boom in the stock market (along with stimulus) because business could borrow money for less. 

Currently, Bonds have been selling off which increases the Yield. This increases interest rates making businesses dependent on cheap lending, like Tech, to fall in price. Bonds are selling off because people are expecting inflation to increase with a hotter economy and it doesn’t make sense to have money tied to low yield bonds when inflation is greater than the Bond Yield. 

So now the stock market is going through a period of volatility because of the Bond sell off and uncertainty about inflation. To ease this uncertainty investors have wanted the Fed to announce Yield Curve Control (YCC). Basically, the Fed buys Bonds to keep the Yield at a desired rate. So far it looks like the Fed isn’t worried about the rates right now and want to see more sustainable economic growth before doing anything with rates. 

Questions for discussion:
Why would the markets react poorly to rising Yield? I get that it’s more expensive to finance debt but won’t the Bond sellers most likely move money into the stock market?

The Fed wants inflation, and inflation fears have driven a Bond sell off. If the Fed gets their inflation target and it doesn’t go out of control than shouldn’t markets calm down? I see no reason the Fed would loose control, they have so many more tools than they ever have before. 

If the market is doomed to be stifled because of all this where is a good place to move money? Obviously all stocks won’t suck and many have already started the rotation into value and emerging markets.",['TGT']
m99wgz,grlnexc,stocks,comment,1616256996,">Why would the markets react poorly to rising Yield? 

IIRC the S&P dividend yield is about 2%, so when you can get 2% from a treasury some investors will prefer the guaranteed stability of a bond to the market. this is most impactful with large pension funds and the like, managing zillions of dollars. they'll sell a ton of stocks or indexes, and buy a ton of bonds. this drives down stock prices in the short-term.",['SPGI']

Personally I think weaning off low rates had to be done at some point. Leaving them that low gives the Fed less tools to rescue the economy in the future and it kills savings. Better to bite the bullet now. It was impossible to sustain forever and creates way too much imbalance. 

Also, people still are not understanding that 2020-2021 rates were THE LOWEST RATES EVER.

So basically we are going from the lowest rates ever to the closest to lowest rates ever.

Fed is NOT going to let inflation get out of control, they just don't want to be subservient to a bunch of lame azz bond traders who keep throwing tantrums.

Also these doom and gloom scenarios get thrown out there to sway the masses. For short term traders, it's helpful to see what the establishment is trying to move in the short term and go with the flow, but for long term funds, you're never going to be able to time it correctly.",

m9i4bz,,stocks,post,1616280176,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

>As a reminder, the video game business has historically been characterised by earnings cyclicality, with revenues and profits driven  by  the  periodic  release  of  new  consoles.  Sony  transformed  its  own  gaming  business  by  introducing  a  subscription service, microtransactions, platform fees and streaming services, reducing reliance on hardware sales, and introducing higher-margin, recurring (sticky) revenue streams which are prized by the market for being stable and highly visible.  
>  
>In our view, Nintendo is at the beginning of a similar process. In 2020, management took large strides in shifting its videogame business towards an attractive, digitally focused model by introducing both subscription revenues and downloadable content onto the Switch platform. The pandemic served as a catalyst to move consumers online, making the digital subsegment the fastest growing part of Nintendo, now accounting for 42% of software sales and helping drive operating margins to 37% (+11% over last year). In addition to the digital transformation, Nintendo has the option to further monetise its world-class IP by expanding  into  new  areas –for  example,  through  opening  its  first-ever  theme  park  and  the  release  of  a  new  Super  Mario movie, slated for 2022.   
>  
>Despite the deep moat given by IP and the ongoing transformation of the business, Nintendo trades at c. 10x operating profits, which we believe reflects fears that management will attempt to re-invent the wheel with each hardware cycle, meaning that profits will continue to be cyclical and the business will always be exposed to the risk of an unsuccessful console launch –for example, the introduction of the Wii (highly successful) and the Wii U (less successful). In our view, this risk is overstated,and we believe there is strong evidence to suggest that Nintendo is moving away from unpredictable hardware cycles, towards the Switch becoming the sole platform, upgraded each cycle, similar to the PlayStation. The release of the Switch Lite in 2019 and the upcoming release of the Switch Pro, with upgraded hardware, highlights Nintendo’s desire to extend the Switch lifecycle, offering consumers  a better experience on refreshed versions of the platform. Furthermore, the introduction of microtransactions,  subscription  services,  and  different  price  point  consoles  suggests  that  Nintendo  is  starting  to  build  an ecosystem  where  consumers  will  store  their  Switch  game  data  on  the  cloud  and  in  turn,  upgrade  their  console  every  few years.   
>  
>We are excited about Nintendo as an investment opportunity and believe that it holds out the prospect of both significant earnings growth and valuation upside as the market comes to appreciate the new and improved business model.

They will, absolutely they will. If they cared about hardware continuity they would still make 'traditional' games consoles.

I love Nintendo and love their culture, but they don't care about maximising profits.

Nintendo's online offerings are still really bad compared to competitors and so underutilised its slightly mind boggling tbh. That said, they are still a good investment at these prices.",
m9gd77,grp5w6k,stocks,comment,1616333188,"I feel like Nintendo is the video game company that is best positioned to expand outside the box of consoles and exclusives.  They can feasibly take their exclusives, and market them as seperate real world entities.  There can be a Super Mario Land, there can be a Pokemon World, and those would have a high chance of success because there's a family friendly and almost timeless vibe.  Sony and Microsoft have either not yet attempted to capitialize on that niche, or have not found the same success.

I feel like in the long run, it would be more attainable for Nintendo to clean their house in terms of upgrading hardware/closing the gap in system capabilities, improve their online features/functions, and through this court additional developers to round out current weak points in their library, than it would for Sony/Microsoft to build the brands neccesary to compete with Nintendo outside of the box.

TLDR; I think Nintendo has the best chance of cross success.  They may be a slow burner, and there's things to improve upon, but the upside is there.","['GPS', 'MSFT']"

I know the very basics like how market cap works.

For example, Is there any relation between a company's revenue and their market cap? What kind of EPS are you supposed to look for to see if a company is undervalued? What P/E ratio is considered fair value for tech stocks? How does a company benefit from their share price going up without diluting? I assume they own shares of their own, and that's how they benefit from it when they sell? How do you tell if a company's quarterly revenue is good with respect to it's market cap?

What you're asking for is basically trying to understand the nuance of how the market works. That's a forever ambiguous and changing answer. 

What's the way to determine the fair value of a house? Market comps. Price per square foot is a baseline way to compare houses of different sizes. Lot size, school district, age of the roof/HVAC system all matter as well, and it will always vary from house to house, neighborhood neighborhood to neighborhood, state to state. 

Same for companies. Compare within industries. For larger profitable companies, EPS and P/E ratios can be good comparisons, but to compare companies of varying size, use P/S or P/B ratio. Don't use KO as your example to show that PG or UNH is undervalued.","['KO', 'UNH', 'PG']"

Bear Case:

This is all just getting ridiculous and too much.  Investing needs to return to reality.  It will be better for everyone.

How do you even begin to value a software, car, insurance, battery, ride-hail service company?  What margins do you use?  What revenues?  Do you take the high margins from software and combine them with the massive revenues of automotive?

It's like a forecast of the Frankenstein monster company; stitched together with the best pieces of each sector.  Should we also add in dividend projections from the utility sector for Tesla's solar farm business?

All of this is just getting too crazy and makes less practical sense each day.  A company like this has never existed in human history!  But this time is different?  Why?  Because a fund manager who is hemorrhaging money (and - for great emphasis - not projected to hemorrhage money in the *future* \- but, is hemorrhaging money *today*) needs it to be true?  Because she is trying to save face before her whale clients pack up and leave?

Also, I thought they forecasted self driving to be live and in use across society by 2018.   And that failed.  I thought they were re-projecting a minimum of 10+ more years to solve the harder problems of dealing with visual impairments like snow and rain?  It's why most of the testing is stuck in the blue sky of Nevada and Arizona.  I think all the easy AI problems got solved 10 years ago - only the super hard ones are left.

And why do they believe Tesla is the most probable company to deliver this technology?  I don't know; I like Tesla and all, but, are they really going to beat Google, Amazon, and Apple in an AI tech race?  That seems highly improbable actually - not probable.

And then, there's this argument that Tesla is so far ahead of the other auto manufacturers; which is a true and factual statement.  However, it is not the complete picture.  The other auto manufacturers are always behind in technology.  They choose to be this way.  When the new inventions and technologies mature and arrive, they work out deals with the patent holders for the rights to put the tech in their cars.  They've always done this.  They are essentially outsourcing large portions of R&D.

So, what happens if just about any other company in the world discovers and patents important EV and self driving technologies other than Tesla?

In addition, another more prudent question is: Is Tesla beating Google and other silicon valley start-ups in AI and EV?  I don't think the answer to that question is obvious at all.  I think Tesla might actually be behind Google!  Waymo looks pretty promising.  And this goes back to the Frankenstein company dilemma.  You are rating the tech strength in Tesla to the tech strength in an auto company - which everyone already knows is weighted in favor of Tesla.  But, you are not punishing the Tesla valuation for its small revenues when compared to a true, auto giant.

Right now, we're in the middle of a pandemic. Yes, businesses are starting to open up, but a lot of people have had more cash on hand thanks to being able to work from home. Those who have lost their jobs do not have the cash to buy non-essential goods. If a company is sitting on a low P/E ratio ratio, they're probably profitting big-time off the pandemic. It's only a matter of time before they lose a lot of their revenue. 
Additionally, we're in a new era for the stock market. It's more accessible, arguably now more than ever. People can trade on no/low commissions, margin, and many have found options. This means there's a lot of potential for more cash inflow into the market, especially long term ETFs like QQQ, VOO, and I'm sure ICLN will be one that many throw some cash at with the prospects of a big move to clean energy over the next 10 years.

m93gtj,grkrl8n,stocks,comment,1616235000,"Does someone have a logical take on what the fuck is actually going on with GME? There's still so much weird shit going on it feels like. If anyone wants to chime in, I'd love some opinions (please no ape strong together or conspiracy stuff) on the following things:

* why was part of the last congress hearing cut out by CNBC? Even if they were shills for Citadel, what was so problematic with that part? And if it wasn't, why was it cut out anyway?
* How the fuck is GME staying over 200 for so long with ""nothing sketchy going on""? Why did it even go up again? And why was there a battle around $200 dollars? I've been investing for ten years (mostly in local markets and conservative stuff like managed funds etc.), and I've never seen anything quite like the last few minutes of yesterday...
* Why do people talk about ""low volume""? Volume is still multiples higher on GME than it was before January, so volatility is actually still to expect. But then again, how can it be that there are hard price drops and breakouts with (relatively) low volume? Wouldn't lower volume result in a steady and slow pullback? Or is volume high enough to cause such violent drops and breakouts?
* While we're at it, what was up with AMC yesterday? It's rare to see a stock flatline like that, when it has actual volume?
* why in the world are there people literally brigading the shit out of every GME thread, writing multiple comments telling people to sell for their own sake and shit? Why would anyone care so much about strangers on the internet losing money to get so militant/aggressive? Is it just negative karma farming? Trolling? Or butthurt people that lost money and are now on angry crusades?
* Why the fuck would DFV stay in his position for so long? He could have walked away with 50+ million? I love the guy just for the memes, but that is insanity.  Do you think he sold by now? I know it doesn't matter, just curious.
* are there any 'organic' reasons that could explain what happened in the last few weeks? I know there's this theory that some whale pushed the stock up again and other whales fighting against that. If yes, I'd guess that fight is over and that's why it's dropping with low volume. But if that's whats happened, why did so many days end with photo finishes around particular prices? Is there still whales fighting about something? Or is it actually retail buying at certain key points, because they think ""oh no, it's 199, ape together strong, buy buy buy""? But if that's true, why does price always drop right before market close (yesterday it was 201.40 and trending upwards, when at 30 seconds before close, it violently dropped to 199 before closing right at 200.27 after a pushback)?
* Is there any world in where retail actually **does** hold most of the float and this shit could still blow up? Last I saw, there was ~40% of the float shorted. Does the number even matter? Wasn't VW only 12%? 

Anyway, I'd love some civil (and non-elitist) discussion about all this, because I can't really make sense of all of it. I like GME, mostly because I made around $8000 bucks in the first rally and it was fun (and stressful), but I'm not attached to it like most of WSB or detached and acting like it doesn't exist like people in other subs. I still have 11 shares left for the fun of it.

But fuck me, all of this is stupid, isn't it!

m85sp6,,stocks,post,1616116387,"List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doingI'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*

*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*

**Let's begin:**

1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..
2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.
3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.

&#x200B;

\--

Ok, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:

**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are ""undervalued"" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)

\-OR-

**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an ""investors"" path. This is a ""speculators"" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)

\--

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:

1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!
2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.
3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!
4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:

1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.
2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.
3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.
4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.

I hope this post will help some of you.

m9o9g9,,stocks,post,1616300495,"Do you think AVLR (AVALARA INC) (NYSE) will really be the “Amazon Killer tollbooth?”Stephen McBride claims it will be. It’s AI will automate tax compliance, and according to Stephen McBride, shareholders will basically get a piece of EVERY INTERNET TRANSACTION, and with online shopping only growing, this will mean more and more flowing in!

Now, I’m not sure how true that may actually be, but the software definitely sounds very promising, and something virtually all companies will probably end up needing to keep themselves from getting audited.

I was going to sell a few of my GME shares to take a little less from my savings, but I’m holding those 12 shares!

AVLR is currently $135.12, and I’ve already taken another $1,000 from my savings (I still have over 7K, but it’s not growing sitting in a savings account!) to add to my stimulus and tax return.

The maximum I can afford (without digging even more into the savings, in which case I have 7K, and would probably stop myself from going under 5K, if not 6K) is 17 shares of AVLR.

That may or may not make me rich within 5-10 years (probably not, but perhaps 20-50K, more or less).

The thing is, I’m 25, and already having a life crisis. I haven’t enjoyed my youth, I’ve just been existing and now panicking more and more as I grow closer to 26 (both because I’ll have to pay for my own health insurance, and it’s just the beginning of the second half of my 20s).

I never got to have a real social life. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve never even, been intimate.

At this point in my life, I feel I need extraordinary circumstances to make up for all the life I lost, and just be able to enjoy life now. I don’t even look forward to a life of working anymore. All I see around me is not only everyone else my age being broke and living with their parents, but even MUCH OLDER PEOPLE being janitors and cashiers, even working 70 HOUR WORK WEEKS, just to survive.

I don’t want to have to struggle so much just to survive! That’s pointless! 

I’m not getting any younger. I feel more and more rejected by society everyday, and I’m becoming more painfully aware of my own, being so behind for my age.

People say age doesn’t matter, BUT IT DOES. One, our lives are finite, our bodies age and decay, we die.

Two, the older we get, like, 26, the more financial and social consequences there are for still not being moderately successful and independent.

I figured if I throw in another few thousand, worst case scenario, it’s not like AVLR will plummet severely anytime soon, right? This isn’t a volatile stock like GME, right?

This is a MASSIVE GAME CHANGER, RIGHT?",['AMZN']

m918qt,,stocks,post,1616221453,"Coinbase’s Direct Listing Pushed Back to AprilCoinbase Global Inc., the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is now aiming to go public in April after its plans for a direct listing this month have slipped, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it was private.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reviewing the company’s plans for a direct listing, an alternative to a traditional initial public offering.

A representative for Coinbase declined to comment.

This week, Coinbase’s backers registered for as many as 114.9 million shares to trade when the stock lists. In a direct listing, investors can begin selling their holdings as soon as a company starts trading rather than waiting for the expiration of a lockup period -- typically up to six months in an IPO.

Investment firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures are among those whose shares could trade, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam have also registered stock.

Coinbase shares have changed hands at $200 to $375.01 in private transactions this year, the filing shows. The volume-weighted average price per share for transactions from January through March 15 was $343.58, which would give Coinbase a public market valuation of about $67.6 billion, based on the total number of shares outstanding as of Monday. The fully diluted value -- including employee incentive plans and restricted stock units -- would be significantly higher.

The debut will be the first major direct listing to take place on the Nasdaq. All such previous listings were on the New York Stock Exchange, including those by Spotify Technology SA, Slack Technologies Inc., Asana Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Roblox Corp., which listed this month.

Coinbase’s latest financial statements revealed that the company is making money, setting it apart from many other startups when they make their public debuts. Coinbase swung from a loss to a profit of $322 million last year on net revenue that more than doubled to $1.14 billion.

This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

If anyone needs to chat - by all means shoot me a note. Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.

Neither person involved are professionals or financial advisors.

What are the legalities there? It *feels* like nothing is illegal or wrong ethically or morally, but my science brain wants 3rd party opinion and discussion because I'd rather not even accidentally be involved in financial crimes or whatnot.

If she were to slap down $100 buckos each month and say ""Put this into your account, under [$CARZ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/CARZ) and [$BJK](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/BJK), and we'll see what happens?"" could there be potential ass-bitings in the future from black-suited gentlemen on the behalf of a government agency?

She's 58, on disability and has health issues. I suspect she may be trying to avoid disclosure to her boyfriend - which I don't think is a problem because they aren't married or jointly contracted to anything such as properties or loans - and also because I think *she thinks* that she's going to die soon, but I'm hesitant to move forward because I just can't figure out any legal standings on the matter; probably because I'm a google dipshit.

This is in Texas, and I guess for disclosure I hold VTI, VXUS, VNQ, BND, BNDX and a few solo stocks like Ford (I like the stock) and SIRI (A friendly wager with a friend on whether Sirius or XM radio stocks would take off, they ended up merging as SiriusXM and I hold one share as a fond memory).

I want to help, and she is dead-set on not opening her own brokerage account but rather 'gifting' said money over to be invested on her behalf in my own account.

I mean, my friend's. .............

I've spoken with her about her decision to take BJK and CARZ instead of say, VOO or the Qs and her literal response was ""I like Cirque Du Soleil and casinos, but don't want to gamble. Also cars are cool."" so I think it boils down to her version of 'I just like the stocks.' I've brought up the options of an HSA or even an ABLE account, but.. I'll be honest. This woman spent the 70's and 80's, even up to today, at biker bars hustling people on pool tables. If she tells a man ""No"" then not even a thunderbolt from God can change her mind.

**Competition**

There are competitors in the field of AR glasses, but none come close to the size that Vuzix has as Vuzix is a field leader. Most competitors sell inferior products (either heavier/thicker, provide inadequate support, or use inferior technology). Vuzix is also a market leader in revenue for AR glasses. 

This is a very niche environment that few have been able to enter, so Vuzix has a strong grasp on future growth.

More can be read about their competitors on their [10K](https://ir.vuzix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings##document-24822-0001558370-21-003001-1) beginning at the end of page 9.

[**Management**](https://ir.vuzix.com/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) **and** [**Investors**](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/vuzi#listings_table-sticky-header)

Paul J. Travers, CEO, President, and Director

Original founder of Vuzix in 1997 and has served as a board member starting November of the same year. Prior to Vuzix, Travers founded e-Tek Labs (acquired by Belkin in 1999) and Forte Technologies. 30+ years in consumer electronics and 25 years in VR. He also owns roughly 6.2% of the company and is the largest individual shareholder.

Grant Russell, CFO, Executive Vice President, Treasurer, and Director

Has served as CFO since 2000 and as a member of the board since April 2009. Between 1997 to 2004, Russell developed a software firm, computer store and cyber cafe, which he sold. In 1984, he co-founded Advanced Gravis Computer, which became the largest joystick manufacturer with sales of $44 million worldwide. Gravis was listed on the NASDAQ and Toronto Stock Exchange, then, in 1996, it was acquired by a Fortune 100 company.

Timothy Harned, Director

The newest member of the board having joined in June 2017, Harned has experience in investment banking, corporate development, and financial advisory with 30+ years of experience in mergers and acquisitions. He also has 20+ years of experience in technology fields and 10 years in consumer and industrial companies. Harned’s resume in financials is in-depth with experience at Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.

State Street Corp owns roughly 4.8 million shares.

Vanguard owns roughly 2 million shares.

Blackrock owns roughly 800,000 shares.

**Analysts and Estimates**

Vuzi is currently rated a Buy with an average target price of $31.67 (low of $30 and high of $35). An EPS estimate of -$0.27 is given for next year, which would half the current EPS.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI/analysis/

**Risks**

Although not likely, they can dilute their shares again if needed. They are currently sitting on over $40 million in cash, so they won’t need to, but it is definitely a possibility in the future.

As Vuzix is not a startup and is still cash flow negative by a large margin, they need to improve their scalability and increase profits to be seen as a viable company for future investors.

As Vuzix has not made a profit, rising interest rates could hurt them when they need to take out loans to maintain business (not likely as they have plenty of cash on hand).

**Technical Analysis**

This is my own analysis, so take with however much salt you like.

Vuzi has been on an explosive uptrend the last few days after having been beaten the past few weeks. They have maintained themselves in the upper BB for quite some time (although it is widening), and their 10 EMA and 20 EMA has held very steadily. The MACD signal line crossed mid-February signalling a buy and it has maintained a healthy divergence. Their recent price action increase has them slightly overbought, but not necessarily a sell (at least not to me). 

Current support and resistance around $29.50, $25, $23.80, $21, and $19 (although will most likely not be maintained). More realistic support and resistance around $26, $22, $21, $19.50, $18, and $15.50.

Another thing I noticed is their volume fluctuation on drastic green days vs drastic red days. Drastic green day volume typically has twice the volume of normal and high red days, but red days have a much steeper price change on lower volume. Not sure what to make of that. Maybe people are holding? Maybe the volume is being diluted across multiple days? Not sure.

My buy range is between $18 and $23 (this does not mean it will reach these prices again, and does not mean it will rebound once it does). My current rating is a hold until (if) it reaches these prices again.

**Final Thoughts/TL;DR**

Vuzix is a long-term buy for me, but not at the current price. AR glasses are the future, and I believe they are able to establish themselves in this niche sector. Their products, although not revolutionary, are far beyond the competition and provide excellent ROI for the companies that utilize them. Once they're able to scale up, they will be worth much more than they are now.

I have a current rating of hold until (if) it reaches my buy range of $18-$23 where I plan to buy more. I do believe a pullback from the recent jump is due, but not necessarily guaranteed. I strongly believe in this company and its experienced and well-vested board to increase revenue and push the company into a multi-billion dollar state compared to its current valuation of around $1 billion.

I currently hold 25 shares at $23.50 that I’ve been holding for a month (talk about bad timing) as a means to include it into my portfolio and continuously check the price.","['GPS', 'INTC', 'BAC', 'IR', 'MS', 'NDAQ', 'STT', 'TGT', 'HD', 'USB', 'BLK']"

I lived through 2008 as I started in 2005 so that set you up for the rest of your life. The only difference since then has been that Federal Reserve intervention has been much faster so you now have less time to take advantage of mass panic compared to 2008 which a drawn out affair into early 2009. Also this time unlike previous market panic, the federal government got heavily involved through Fiscal intervention.

I have a low 7 figure portofolio so I was a little worried if it would be cut in half like 2008 but in 2008, I just had a low 6 figure portfolio  so it was bearable. I started restructuring my portfolio by selling questionable balance sheet companies and companies that would clearly be affected by travel, country ETFs, sector ETFs, bond funds etc. Raised some 500K all in all and then started scaling into long term quality and some growth

Retirement accounts are DCAing every week and I've raised a lot of cash from my brokerages last week and this week to buy some quality for a once in a blue moon opportunity. So much fear going around it's hard to pass up if you have a long term view. Ready for another -20% drop. Have a Kovid19 watchlist ready and have started scaling in at every major drop. Assuming that we'll reach peak Kovid19 by summer, economic impacts felt all way into Thanks giving and Christmas shopping season and business as usual by this time next year.
>>yeah, they are assumptions but it's safe to assume we will reach peak Kovid19 at some point. Then the question is how long the downturn would last... all over by Christmas season? effects felt all the way into next summer? triggers a decade of stagflation and NIRP? who knows. I can afford to take the risk. Will be a buyer at different levels while the stock market goes through a rout.

>> • Growth/Cloud tech

>>They look very overvalued now and they are priced at many multiples of revenue and currently don't make a profit but they are growing fast. So basically you are buying fast growing companies that are increasing revenue but generating operating losses every quarter and net income is also negative.

Bought WBA in September at the exact bottom though I was planning to buy a lot more lower but that has done really far better than expected on the rebound. I was expecting a buyout but looks like that didn't happen

>>I had some cash...so i put 20k of it into Walgreens at 34 when WBA was valued at 30B. In normal times I would never look at a crappy company like Walgreens but at some point with so much cash floating around looking for value, there has to be an oppertunity here. I'm expecting it to get privatized or bought this year after KKR passed up a leveraged buyout discussion last year when it was valued at 55B (with ~17B debt) as that was a very costly transaction they had no appetite for. KKR has had a close relationship with Walgreens for years so they seemed like the most likely candidate. Also the largest individual shareholder Stefanno Passina has a ~16% stake in the company so there were rumors that he wanted to privatize it too. They will have a lot of flexibility at cutting costs once they are privatized. It's valued at 30B now way below the 55B it was valued at when talks about privatization were public last year. Badly managed company with a large retail footprint, good balance sheet and earnings hammered due to impact from Covid19 and not adapting to competition and technology changes in the landscape. Sales are stable or growing very slowly. Forward PE of 7x. Earnings are expected to trend up late next year after cost cutting measures are implemented. You have to expect more sales once covid19 is behind us even if it means next year.","['FB', 'IBM', 'MDT', 'ADBE', 'MSFT', 'DIS', 'DLR', 'HCA', 'SBUX', 'AMZN', 'CTXS', 'WBA', 'JPM', 'PYPL', 'AXP']"
m8ukjr,,stocks,post,1616197841,"GAW (Warhammer) & Cineworld Group DD (X-posted from r/investing)# ***Disclaimer, positions and reasoning for post.***

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know. 

**Positions:**

I have a handful of shares in Cineworld Group (CWD/CNNWF) and am considering investing in both Games Workshop Group (GAW/GMWKF) and Brewdog, when it eventually IPOs.

[Games workshop annual reports and half-year results](https://investor.games-workshop.com/annual-reports-and-half-year-results/) 

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

For those who are interested in ethical investing Brewdog is a certified [B-Corp](https://www.brewdog.com/bcorp) and has a growing focus on sustainable production and distribution.

EDIT2: Yes, I am aware now that I'm too far spread out. We're fixing that.  

__________  

Hey y'all. So I'm basically brand new to investing - I've dicked around on Robinhood before years ago, but never anything serious. I grew up in poverty and am only just finding my way out, so investment is still quite new but incredibly exciting to me.  

Yesterday, I took $500 and put it into the market. Here's what I bought. I plan on holding all pretty much until it's either time to retire or until daddy's gotta make a purchase. My logic behind choosing tickers was as follows:  

1) The index is too important to miss, and as I've said elsewhere, a 14% annual return over a lifetime feels much better than jumping off a cliff. **The indexes I chose are FTEC, QQQ, SCHA, SPY, VOO, VGT, and VUG.**   

2)Dividends are probably the most important aspect of a long term single stock hold IMO, closely followed by overall stability/growth projections. You don't need much inherent growth with dividend stocks, they just can't dip too far or else you're breaking even. Even if the stock itself stays even, you'll still compound your way ahead. **The dividend paying stocks I chose are AMCR, HBAN, HPE, KEY, PEP, T, and TM.** PEP and TM could arguably fall under other categories, but they both pay respectable dividends and are staple companies which will likely exist until the end of the current world, so they're on the list.    

-And finally, I chose one stock that I consider to be a knock off version of a growth stock. It has the growth potential, but it also has the dividend to boot, and really I'm looking at **TROW** and trying to find something wrong with the stock, but I can't. So TROW it is.  

To preemptively answer some questions:  

-I diversified within ETFs for two reasons; first, because it means more money overall within the indexes, and second because they'll all perform decently enough, but it's likely one or two might outperform the others, and I want in on those.  

-I chose AMCR because it's been rock steady for as long as the Earth has been round, and the dividend is unreal. I chose T for similar reasons, although T also falls under ""buy what you use"" in my case.  

-To me, HPE was the biggest ""risk"" in this portfolio, just because there's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that it will grow drastically from its current status. However, again, HPE isn't going anywhere any time soon, it's recovering somewhat decently from the pandemic crash, and the dividend is still there. As long as I don't lose ~15% or more on price over the long term, I should still be in good shape.  

So yeah. I sure feel like a monkey making and describing these decisions, but I wonder how bad or good these decisions actually are. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED talk.  

EDIT: In the brief time this has been up I've learned quite a bit more, which is honestly typical /r/stocks (thanks). What I'm learning is that I need to pay a little closer attention to what exactly each ETF follows, and that I possibly over-diversified. Apparently I'm still trading with technically unsettled funds, so once everything settles I'll look at making some corrective decisions. Thanks again.","['TROW', 'HBAN', 'PEP', 'HPE', 'AMCR']"

Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

m8tj0f,,stocks,post,1616194687,"DD on RFP: A lumber value play poised to have its best Q earnings in a decade due to surge in lumber prices.For the last few months, I was looking for how to play this insane surge in lumber prices and if any of the lumber companies were still a good value play. The larger companies (WFG and WY) seemed to have their profits priced in and have been trading sideway for months.

So a friend pointed me to RFP: Resolute Forest Products.  I did a deep dive on the company and thought I'd share it.  RFP is up 41% YTD (as of close on 3/19/31), up 479% for the last year (as of close on 3/19/21).  When you look at the company’s history and metrics, it starts to make sense why its stock price has grown so much recently and why it probably still will.  

For reasons articulated below, it appears on track to release its best earnings statement in at least decade on April 29 this year, and if commodity prices hold, Q2 should be even better given that home builders project higher volume in Q2 than Q1..

**Brief History Description**

RFP is a Canadian paper/pulp/forestry company that used to gain a majority of its revenue from newsprint and specialty paper.  In the late 2000’s, the company had way too much debt and with the huge decline in print journalism, it lost a lot of its largest source of income.  They went into bankruptcy in the late 2000’s and came out of it December 2010 and changed their name to Resolute Forest Products.  Over the last decade the company has been trying to transform itself, building up its lumber and pulp production capacities while consolidating paper production and paying down debt.

The only decent year they had was 2018.  Their Q2 earnings (Net GAAP Income of 72 million; $.72 EPS;) was the best quarter they had had in years.  And the market reaction was pretty dramatic. Here’s the graph ([LINK](https://imgur.com/a/yjj3tqi?)) with the earnings dates circled.  From March to September, the stock doubled in value; a majority of that price increase occurring in the span of six weeks starting with the Q2 earnings announcement.  

What made Q2 so good? Lumber had a small surge in price in the middle of Q2, as did wood pulp.  ([graph of lumber futures](https://imgur.com/gallery/Q1r1Nbm)).  Nothing compared to now, but it was significant at the time.

RFP’s Q3 was even better, with a net income of 117 million, an EPS of $1.25, and a special dividend of $1.50/share.  However, the price of lumber dropped like a rock before Q3 earnings, and so the stock started going down with it.  However, that Q3 announcement got a 25% stock price jump in a day.

**Present Day Conditions**

2020 was a rough year for RFP.  Their paper segment EBIDTA was ~85% less than 2019 due to the pandemic which caused a huge drag on their annual income and luckily has kept this company under the radar compared to some of the larger forestry companies that don’t produce paper.  

That being said let’s look at their valuation ratios based on 2020 income (As of 3/19/21):

    **RFP**
    P/E				85.75
    Forward P/E		5.50
    Price/Sales		.27
    Price/Book		.77
    Price/Cash flow	4.25

I won’t even put up the SP 500 valuation ratios because it doesn’t make sense to compare them. (But if you care, SP 500 numbers are substantially more overvalued than RFP).  So let’s compare RFP to the Paper/pulp competitors’ average (in this I used tickers GLT, MERC, CLW, NP, and UFS) [Link for Schwab comparison](https://imgur.com/gallery/IX7hCrn):

    **Paper/Pulp**
    P/E			      31.68
    Forward P/E		12.86
    Price/Sales		.724
    Price/Book		2.138
    Price/Cash flow	18.676

The P/E is high however when you look the others’ in the link you’ll see only two of those paper/pulp companies had positive earnings last year.  MERC, NP and UFS, were negative earnings thus had no positive PE.  Despite that, RFP still has a better forward PE than these other companies. From a valuation metric, RFP seems to have the best forward outlook and by far the most undervalued.  Now let’s compare RFP’s ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, UFPI, and IFSPF) ([Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/kADg2st)):

    Forestry/Lumber Avg
    P/E				15.13
    Forward P/E		14.04
    Price/Sales		1.76
    Price/Book	       3.83
    Price/Cash flow	11.4
		
Compared to the other major lumber companies, RFP again has the best forward looking PE and is undervalued as compared to other similar industry players’ price to book and price to sales metrics.  The stock could double form its current value and it still would be undervalued compared to its competitor.  That probably explains why RFP has been performing better, price wise, than any of the larger companies:

RFP—41% YTD, 80% 6-Months, 479% 1-yr

WFG—2%, 23%, 229%	    

WY—1%, 22%, 108%

In terms of why RFP is still flying under the radar, first, they are a company that had not been doing well for years, have been turning it around for the last decade while refocusing their main sources of income.  That takes time and money which mutes their true earnings once those one times costs disappear.  So their 10-year graph and historic earnings reports are not pretty.  

Second, because of how badly the pandemic hit their paper segment, it has hidden the growing EBIDTA run rate from their lumber and pulp segments.  So their earnings are much less than the forestry companies, while being much higher than the other paper companies of comparable size to RFP.

Lastly, any time the major financial media companies (Like CNBC) discuss the lumber surge, they either suggest people invest in Home Depot / Lowes, Lumber Liquidators or the largest forestry companies, WY and WFG, which already have their future profits priced in.  So those investors who do whatever the talking heads tell them to do, they are going to miss stocks like RFP.

**The Bullish Case for 2021**

As of right now, the average analyst projection for Q1 is 1.26 EPS. Let’s look at RFP’s yearly GAAP Net income / EPS for the last decade:

    RFP 	Net Inc. GAAP	EPS
    2011   	   41	              0.42
    2012	        -2	              -0.02
    2013	        -639	        -6.75
    2014	        -277	        -2.93
    2015	        -257	        -2.78
    2016	        -81	               -0.9
    2017	        -84	        -0.93
    2018	        235	         1.96
    2019	        -47	         -0.51
    2020	         10	               0.12

Meaning if RFP hits the average analyst estimate of 1.26 EPS, it’ll be the best quarterly EPS they’ve had in a decade, and almost last much earnings in their single best year in the last decade.  

And in all likelihood, these analysists may still be underestimating RFP’s earnings for 2021.  For example: Here is “RBC’s capital market issuer disclosure for its analyst’s [Paul Quinn] $1.16 EPS estimate for Q1 and 11$ price target:

“Valuation (2/5/2021): Our price target of $11 is based on a blended 5.5x EV/EBITDA multiple using our trend EBITDA of $250MM (weighted 85%) and our 2021 EBITDA estimate of $447MM (weighted 15%). Our target multiple is near the low end of the typical North American Paper and Forest Products trading range (5.0x to 8.0x), reflecting the company’s exposure to the declining newsprint/groundwood paper markets.”

In 2018, RFP produced 200 EBIDTA from the mini surge in lumber price, ([Link to Q4 Earnings Slide](https://imgur.com/gallery/QdCqSAv)) and the average transaction price for the year was $446 mbf.  The higher the price of lumber the higher the portions of those sales go to straight earnings.  

If lumber maintains an average transaction price of at least 800 (and it’s been trading over $1000 Since February), RFP is looking at possibly over 200 EBITDA for the quarter, much less for the year.  And that doesn’t include any extra earnings from pulp or paper.  So the analyst’s projection of a run rate of 250 EBITDA for the whole company for all of 2021, is grossly underestimating the earnings RFP will generate form these high lumber sales and suggests RFP will easily beat the Q1 projections.

No only is the price of lumber up, but RFP’s production capacity for lumber is also higher than 2018.  RFP’s 2020 purchase of 3 US sawmills have proven to be perfectly timed.  These mills have begun producing lumber at the start of 2021 and will be at 100% capacity by the end of Q2. (Google Q4 2020 Earnings Call transcript; link blocked by r/investing).  These three mills will roughly increase RFP’s total lumber production by 25%.  That is just extra production capacity at a time when it matters most, meaning much more earning potential than 2018.

As if that weren’t enough, wood pulp is has also surged to the highest price it has been in at least 3 years. ([Link to Shanghai Wood Pulp Futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21))  My guess is that this spike is in large part to China’s ban on single use non-degradable plastic, effective in major cities December 2020. ([LINK](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51171491).)  Because of this surge, RFP has announced multiple price increases to their wood pulp in the last four months, that would put transaction prices the highest they have been in multiple years. 

**Issues with RFP**

I think it’s important to always include any possible downsides.  Things to keep in mind, RFP, being a smaller market cap, is less likely to trade at valuation ratios like the largest companies.  So it is hard to predict when this company is trading at a true fair value.

Also, RFP still has a large amount of debt for their size, and some issues funding their pension.  They are paying it down, but this could also scare off some investors.  They don’t have as high of a return on equity/assets like some of it’s competitors, raising some concerns with the quality of management.  

RFP’s paper still is likely to historically underperform for another quarter or two.  The economy reopening back should bring back some revenue, however, because there are no futures markets for paper, this sector of the company is substantially harder to project.  
The stock itself is very volatile because it is a microcap.  There are probably many investors who avoid that type of volatility.

Lastly, because of its small volume/float size, the stock is more susceptible to market manipulation by the hedge funds or market makers.  So it probably wouldn’t be smart to play with short term calls. 

If you all identify more, I would love to hear it in case I’m missing something and need to readjust my perspective on this stock.

**Fun Tidbit:**

While I was looking into RFP, a buddy sent me these screenshots of Keith “DFV” Gill’s stock portfolio from his Roaring Kitty live streams in August 2020 ([Link](https://imgur.com/a/Qg3U2Ay))  and January 2021 ([Link](https://imgur.com/a/GIQJRd6)).  Apparently, the man REALLY knows how to pick ‘em.  RFP up at ~ 100% since that August video.

**TLDR**: This paper/lumber company spent the last decade turning things around.  It’s had the best price performance of any of the paper/forestry companies for the last year.  2021 Q1 earnings projected to be the best Q earnings in at least a decade, with Q2 likely to be better.   This is probably why Keith Gill has been holding it or looking at it for months.

\- What factors should I be looking at to properly evaluate new assets and the stocks I already have? I've heard good things about Damodaran's book, is that a good introduction to the fundamentals?

\- Since I come from a physics background, I like math a lot. I've been playing around in python calculating Sharpe ratios and the efficiency frontier for various portfolios, just pulling price data from Yahoo. What should I know to use Sharpe ratios and the allocation weights on the efficiency frontier to inform asset allocation and portfolio management decisions?

Untill now, I traded with a single stocks in Revolut, and I recently opened a account with Interactive Brokers on the ideea of finiding a ETF for long term investment. The one most suitable I've been able to find is VUSD (mimics S&P 500, it's at about 74$/share at the moment). I am European, so USA based ETFs are not available. My scenario is that I would like most of my monthly investment money to go in a ETF, and about 30% into something with more risk, that is why I invested in single stocks untill now.  My bank offers a few investment packages, but the taxes on it are way higher that any ETF you can find on a separate broker.

Relevant info:

\- 27, Romania

\- Employed, 1500$/month after taxes (I know it sounds low, but its double the average in my country)

\- Retirement savings

\- \~20year time frame

\- I would like most of my money to be into something more on the ""safe"" side

\- About 1500$ in single stocks in Revolut (most of it is tech and finance)

\- No debts

\- Around 300$/month available for investment, will go up with time

Is my \~210$/month in VUSD and 90$/month in single stocks a decent plan or should I keep looking for another ETF? I would like to keep the most of it for long term. If anyone has any sudgestions on what else I should look at I would apreciate it.",['SPGI']

Canadian Pacific is buying Kansas City Southern in a ~$25B deal - ~22% premium to Friday's closeKansas City Southern ($KSU) was the last class 1 railroad after the big 6 (BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific, and Canadian National) that had not yet been acquired or taken private. There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)  
Here is the [powerpoint presentation](https://ssl.lvl3.on24.com/event/30/20/89/4/rt/1/documents/resourceList1616341384560/cpkcsannouncementdeck32110amfinal1616341383050.pdf) being shown in this conference call

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['NSC', 'KSU', 'CSX', 'UNP']"

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

There's only one real reason I'd go with active management and that is if I had enough money that hedging risk was a good idea and my time was at least as valuable as what they charged (think eight figures and up).

Otherwise I invest in individual stocks with money that I don't need for expenses or retirement. I enjoy it and hope to outperform, but gains beyond what very safe investments (Money market, EE bonds, I bonds, or TIPS) would return is the only real goal.

I will say that I've been pretty successful to date and haven't really lost money on anything yet.

ma2u8r,,investing,post,1616351545,"Expected bond ETF price changes vs yields and deciding when to hold or sell.It's common knowledge that bond prices are inversely related to yields, but when talking about ETFs that are buying and selling constantly and which hold baskets of various issues, what's the anticipated correlation?

Let's say you buy in at a certain price when a hypothetical ETF is offering a 2.5% yield (in something safe like treasuries or high-quality debt). 

What would be expected to happen to the price if over a few years the yield rose to 5.0%? Or dropped to 1.25%?

If talking about a low-risk bond ETF is it the case that the yield you initially buy in at is effectively ""locked"" where over some reasonable length of time the price and yield changes will directly offset each other and you'll end up getting the same return?

Or would they inverse each other in a non 1:1 manner where it would make sense to simply sell your shares because the price has climbed so high relative to the rate being offered?

An interesting example might be BLV with yield recently going from 3.04% in Jan 2021 to 3.3% on 3/19.

It had a yield of 2.83% on Aug 4, 2020 with a price of $117.43 and currently is at $96.82 offering that 3.30%.

That means yield going up 0.47% (a 16.6% change) resulted in a 17.6% price drop. So is that the correct way to predict the correlation and expected price for a given yield?

It seems like if you were lucky enough to buy for $83.5 on Nov 2, 2018 when the yield was 4.13% that selling for $117 on July 31, 2020 (+40%) would be a better move than holding long-term and collecting a fluctuating yield for 10+ years (BLV's 5 year avg yield is 3.59%). 

If you're invested as part of retirement and depend on the payments, are you supposed to be selling off enough to make up the difference if the yield drops below what you originally bought in to get?",['NOV']

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
*  Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract  


I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

m9dmdf,,investing,post,1616266670,"Financial Market PessimismFinancial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

But you’re absolutely correct. Entire foundation of their economic growth has been the addiction to cheap crap around the globe and the fact that companies/industries were funded with massive amounts of state sponsored capital. 

Anytime they’ve tried to reduce financial restrictions, money floods out. Not to say that the United States is the glowing model that a reserve currency it used to be, but people generally still have faith in it.

My guess is that there will be many digital/sovereign currencies - each known for being tied to some sort of hard asset. Lumber, gold, land, tech, etc.

Indeed, China's financial environment is too much of a joke for the country to have a currency with even 1% of that possibility. People talking that non sense are to be laughed at.

About that video: There is something very scary about a ""communist"" or, better to say, an ultra centralised power playing the capitalist country. 

These cities built on ""rational"" planning, thinking they gonna attract people after they carefully followed a plan thought by people who will never live there, seem to be future subjects for an Adam Curtis documentaries...

All that reeks of corruption, administrative zeal, dodgy developers, and ""need to prove my worth"" from useless party members/planners. On top of that you have to wonder the quality of those homes and I seriously doubt most of them will stay in good condition before anyone even think of renting them...

Now, the rise in wages and the insane vacant real estate makes me wonder if we will see China starting to open its borders to migrant workers to sustain its weird economy... can you imagine that?",
m9i525,,investing,post,1616280238,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

I understand there's probably some network stickiness/first mover advantage, but if I'm paying 10x sales (based on it's current market cap and the forward sales numbers you've posted), I have to be very, very confident the growth will continue going forward, just on a revenue basis. 

Furthermore, taking a quick glance at their financial statements, marketing is by far the largest expense item on their P&L. A potential green flag is their marketing expenses are much lower for the T9Ms in FY20 vs FY19. But, has Management indicated they are going to cut back on that spending and think they are starting to get some stickiness in their user base? They managed to grow revenues soundly, despite spending less on marketing, which is why I'm curious what has changed in just 1 year, given these expenses increased over 50% from FY18 to FY19, while rev only grew 30%.","['FB', 'EBAY']"

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",

They've consistently raised fees and shipping prices while the product and service has remained pretty stagnant. Most Poshmark sellers sell their product through other marketplaces as well (ebay, mercari, grailed), that offer less fees for both seller and buyer. They just don't offer a unique enough market to justify their prices. Until they make some big moves to significantly improve their marketplace over competitors, I don't see the value unfortunately.",['EBAY']

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m8o362,grjfujb,investing,comment,1616198653,"I live in Colombia and there are some key points worth knowing before entering this move:

1. **The regulation is volatile.** The government party does not support completely medicinal cannabis. President only supported it with the condition on being more strict on licenses (benefiting big producers as Clever) because his hated predecesor had a more progressive agenda on cannabis. Two years ago there were rumors about an official request looking for a reduction in our global quota. Never happened.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['UPS', 'PGR']"
m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

32 years old

Wait in the market strategy, I am in it for the long run. Intent to invest as much as possible, as I am frugal for the most part.

No debt

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

I am looking for more options, perhaps 5% in Crypto currency? More single stocks like Tesla? Another index fund?

m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers.

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

&#x200B;

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance. This ruling may have a significant impact on funds and investments classified under ESG and socially responsible investing.""

Were participants in these retirement plans not given the option to opt out of ESG investing? or are they now not being given the option to opt in?

However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

Clean energy is supported at a level it finally deserves with the current U.S. Government Administration. The recent sell-off in clean energy was a needed correction, but companies like Novonix will be severely undervalued soon in being that they are working to support the growing demand for Lithium-ion technology and the resources to support it.

FDA for mobile telemetry patch and uplistingREDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 11, 2021 /Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further progress in upcoming quarters.""","['TGT', 'CRM']"

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too.

After some buzz in media with some quite heavy players investing I thought I'd reach out too see if I could join in. Seeing as I'm no millionaire this will be one of the few times I'm able to particiapte. I belive in their business model bigly and honestly think they have a very good chance of succeeding.

Up until now I've only invested in stocks and mutual funds so when it comes to investing in privately-held companies what pitfalls and financial key metrics should I look at / ask them?

The company today:

* Current outstanding shares: 6m
* Implied equity value: 23m USD

They are about to initiate another round of funding, this will be a large round where they are trying to raise 440m USD since they are scaling up substatntionally from local to national distribution and sales in order to supply demand , if sucessfull it will change the numbers to:

* Outstanding shares: 15.5m
* Estimated valuation: 440m USD

Estimated earnings/projections look good but what specific answers should I ask them before jumping the gun and what key metrics should I try and calculate?",

But what people forget is you also don’t want to buy long-duration equities,” Bernstein, CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC’s “[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/)” on Wednesday. “What’s a long-duration equity? Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between [Visa](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE) and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?   


Supporting this idea, [Apple](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ) is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, [Facebook](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FB:NASDAQ?window=1Y) is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak.   


What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech? Will small and medium Tech and Financial stocks see any boost relative to those with massive market capitalization? Or is this all not having much of a market impact at all, and we'll see even Visa's and Apple's stocks jump back up later in the year?","['NDAQ', 'FB', 'SPGI', 'AAPL']"

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

*No pain, no gain.*

**5. The Dow gained 38 points in the 1970s**  
*See above.*

**6. Why am I using the Dow instead of the S&P 500? They’re effectively the same thing. The rolling one-year correlation since 1970 is .95.**  
*Stop wasting your time on this.*

**11. Gold and the Dow were both 800 in 1980. Today Gold is $1,700/ounce. The Dow is near 32k.**

**12. Over the last twenty years, Gold is up 340%. Stocks are up 208%, with dividends.**

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

Greetings

**The narrative**

1. Chinese   energy production by source: Coal 58% Petro 20% Hydro 8% LNG 8%   Renewable 5%  Nuclear 2%. Renewables have had an amazing 10 years with   explosive growth, Liquids and Nuclear growth is more modest but Nuclear   curve is steeper. The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)
2. Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal. "" full  article [here](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210312A0AAON00)
2. The  stock is slightly overvalued and I have a hard time comparing it to  other stocks or indexes. (data source yahoo finance)Trailing P/E 	16.15   Price/Sales (ttm)	1.94  Price/Book (mrq)	1.46  Enterprise Value/Revenue  7.28  Enterprise Value/EBITDA  11.38

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?  


My  background: New to the channel and to reddit, I was brought here by  crypto.I  am looking into subject company, considering that the net-0  emissions  targets are only possible by nuclear energy. I have always  admired the clean and cheap features of nuclear energy, I always  supported it and I anticipate it's golden era.Now, on investing, I would  like your take on  this company, and to initiate discussions which will  circle knowledge  through.Bear in mind that there are some restrictions  to investing in  this company if you are an American at the time of  writing.Last, I  want to avoid the trap of replicating the returns i got  from crypto. My  thinking is long term >5 years and I give weight  both on the  narrative and on fundamentals.",['TGT']

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news.

&amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

[10-K report.](https://wallmine.com/doc/edgar/0001082923/000108292321000033/stmp-20201231.htm)

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat. 

Looking forward to seeing the stock price go to less than a $1.",['TWTR']
m7ih59,,investing,post,1616039606,"The Current State of Uranium. A Move In Spot Price Could Be SoonGenerally speaking, I am looking at uranium as a macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market. At a high level, uranium needs to be in the $50+ (some say $60+) range in order to cover the cost of production. Right now the spot price is hovering around $30.   

That being said, uranium is outperforming. So what then is driving this run? Are we likely to see a move in spot soon?

Personally, I think that the equities are ahead of themselves a little bit and that we could be seeing a pull back soon. I hope not. Still, the spot price is a little bit of a question mark for me because I have seen a number of interviews saying that we are very close for a move in the uranium price. This has led me to the view that I should hold my positions and slowly build until the spot price starts to move.  It’s a risk, but my hypothesis is that the real move will far outpace where we are today.  

Ultimately, uranium is about climate change more than anything and so I am glad we are ahead of schedule. Nuclear is the only way to achieve the carbon goals. 

I will be watching closely in the next few weeks for any movement in the uranium price. Should the spot rise as many of us expect, uranium stock prices will soar.

As always. I am interested in how others perceive the current landscape. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['ETSY', 'AMZN', 'PYPL', 'EBAY']"

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['AMZN', 'FB', 'EBAY']"

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an asset freeze and other emergency relief against an Irvine, California-based trader who used social media to spread false information about a defunct company, while secretly profiting by selling his own holdings of the company's stock.",

m6yvdo,,investing,post,1615982617,"Fed Set To Reaffirm Dovish Stance With Powell Likely To Urge PatienceBolstered by the impact of fiscal and Covid-19 stimulus packages, the US Federal Reserve is expected to forecast an improving economic outlook with the labour market and inflation to rebound faster than anticipated in December.

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

m71yzd,,investing,post,1615992262,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

With the massive influx of people into ""reddit investing"" I assume a significant percentage to be novice (I'm trying to keep it polite). 

That being said, the less sophisticated the  investor, the more likely they would be to act ""later"" and with less regard to risk and volatility. And yet I believed they WOULD act. 

I really feel as if the last 2 months has created a FOMO phenomenon and that there is significant, traditionally irrational buying. 

I just could not figure out a way to quantify and then be able to act on it. 

You've taken my simple idea and added a brain to it.

Thank you for sharing this!

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

(Market cap calculations used for 50 years out is multiplying by 29.45, which is 1.07^50)",['SPGI']

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'TGT']"

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.

That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['ED', 'PWR']"

m6w7uv,,investing,post,1615972004,"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.As I see it:

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter","['SBUX', 'GOOGL', 'NDAQ', 'MSFT']"

2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['GPS', 'PGR']"

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

m6zzhm,,investing,post,1615986444,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['TXN', 'IBM', 'INTC', 'NVDA', 'TER', 'BA', 'QCOM', 'MMM', 'ARKK']"

They are using the strong cash flow from the chip testing business to fund their expansion of automation with the goal of becoming less of a cyclical company. I think its brilliant and have been holding and buying more since 2019. I am hoping they are going to ride the semiconductor/5G super cycle up and in a few years will expand the automation side to be a significant portion of their revenue (right now only about 10% of rev).,

m7c6gf,,investing,post,1616019296,"Apple (fruit) stock analogySo many people are talking about stocks this year, which is similar to the past times when stocks are shooting up and the majority of people are generally winning for now, and feeling good about it, and eager to talk about it, for all sorts of reasons.  

That includes everyone from novice investors to advanced and sophisticated investors, and everyone in between.

One of the most concerning things I hear is this.  

""You should by X.""

""Why?""

""Oh, it was 300 dollars yesterday.  It's 250 now.  So it's cheap.  It's going to go back up"".

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

Good luck out there, be careful, and have fun.",['AAPL']

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

Is there a Vanguard index fund that encompasses his description of Asian/Chinese emerging markets?

Android app stores including those operated by Huawei, Xiaomi and Tencent have reportedly blocked downloads or removed Alibaba's ""UC Browser."" CNBC was unable to immediately confirm the report.

 I check the reason UC browser got deleted from app store is they advertise fake medicines(the drug promise lower blood sugar, or losing weight but it's all bullshit) and that's illegal in China. Not only BABA's app got deleted they are many other app got warning. Including 360(a big cyber security company), multiple job searching app, ford(transmission problem), Infiniti(transmission problem), Kohler, Max Mara(install face recognition camera in their store to analyze customer), and many other companies.

m6w42x,gr7ymhr,investing,comment,1615973992,"Need some advice here.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

Amazon is Jeff’s flywheel. More customers = more revenue to invest in CapEx = more capabilities/lower prices = more customers. There’s a massive CapEx moat if you want to enter the logistics or data center business.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM.

m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.

m6lakz,,investing,post,1615933928,"Plug power - unravelling the jargonI do love having a go at deciphering the management bullsh8t when they have dodgy accounts (sorry if you own it). Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.


Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['BLK', 'NDAQ', 'UPS']"

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

**[Recent 1Q21 Earnings](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/) - 02/03/21**

* Company-wide sales increased 105% to $748.6m in 1Q, driven by support in US Consumer and continued momentum in Hawthorne
* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.
Looking forward to discussing potential supports and counterarguments to this thesis.","['CHD', 'CTVA', 'TGT', 'CF', 'MOS']"

They are able to appeal to the vanity of their customers in the quest for a perfect lawn by selling upscale packaging and lawn photographs.  Being able to sell fertilizer for $20 a bag and dirt for $5 a bag is no easy task but they do it.  The problem is see here is transferring those skills to the marijuana play.  Marketing the way Scott’s does won’t work the same way and it may actually form part of the regulations that come out on legalization.  The government wants the revenues but they don’t want giant dope leaf advertising everywhere.  The subdued nature of the rollout will restrict their upside and not allow them to play to their strengths.  Time and acceptance of the new market may change this however.,

most people can liken this to the gold rush where yea some made it out filthy rich but many other miners went bust and the real smart guys were the ones selling shovels and gold pans.

m6j8i0,,investing,post,1615928302,"Google Play to Slash Fees App Developers Payhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/google-play-to-slash-fees-app-developers-pay-51615922419

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

Q4 earnings miss GAAP EPS off by 7.7%.  FCF analysis puts fair value at $134.  DCF EPS even lower.

It doesn't matter that they had a strong quarter.  What matters is that they set an expectation with investors and missed it by almost 8% or 11.7 cents per share (~$311 million total) in a year where they had been beating earnings by double digit percentages and hadn't had an EPS miss since Q4 2020.  Prices were moving on that expectation and when it failed to materialize, investors penalized WMT.

This continues to further Graham and Buffett's view that stocks trading in excess of their fair value are more susceptible to downward pressure particularly when the market is pricing in earnings that don't materialize as expected.   It should be noted that Buffett doesn't ""buy the ... dip"".... He looks for securities that are trading well below their fair value, typically 30 to 50% below fair value rather than right on the cusp of it, regardless of price movements in relation to near-term highs.",['WMT']

m60b98,,investing,post,1615866531,"I have to be missing something about the EV spaceI have been in the markets since college, about 6 years ago. I am not an expert and have my fair share of misses. This isnt a typical ""doomsday"" post. In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players.","['TSLA', 'ICE', 'GM']"

m60b98,gr3r6j2,investing,comment,1615884824,"This was an honest question, and I will do my best at giving an honest, non-hype no BS answer as good practice to articulate my thoughts on the space. (*Disclaimer:* I could be defined as a mega-bull on the what I'll call broadly the 'electrification' opportunity that faces the world in the 1-2 coming **decades,** EVs being a big part of that). I'll start with my thoughts and then answer your questions. I also work in the space, and have been following it as an energy nerd for...a long time).

I would say **I am very concerned** about the 'EV froth' right now. With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

&#x200B;

I know its been long, but I hope it was worthy of the read. I can always write and share more if there are specific questions.

Edit: And answering your high level question about what you are missing, its that in my view and what I've seen, TSLA has been the one that has derisked a lot of the market and made the manufacturing progress (turning clearly cash flow positive forward looking as of January 2020....hmm) where they have crossed the chasm and are now on, a product manufacturing driven rocket ship. These other companies and the space have enjoyed the rising tides, hype, capital, and knowledge that it is possible. Then comes, the greed, the frauds, the bubble, and the damage. When the tide goes out, who will have no clothes? That is the core of what I think you might be missing about the space.","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

you buy 100 shares at $10 with 10% dividend and market cap of 10 thousand( and the outstanding shares are 1000) that means 

the dividend is is $1 per share with it you can buy 10 shares

if the price goes up to  $20 what would change?

well the market cap would change to 20 thousand but the outstanding shares stayed the same :(

but your dividend percentage would also change :( to 5%

so your dividend would be the (market cap \* the percentage) / the number of shares 1000) \* the amount of shares you own would be still be $100  woot same money!

but your purchasing power went down so now you can only buy 5 shares.",
m6iaod,gr5wuro,investing,comment,1615927239,"

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",
m6iaod,gr68t4c,investing,comment,1615932838,"The company decides what to do with their budget.   

Some spend all their money (wisely or not).  The goal is to grow the business,  build another factory, or buy more trucks or whatever.   Sometimes that means buy a smaller company.   If they grow wisely,  the value of the stock goes up.

Some try to grow, but slowly,  maybe there aren't any good opportunities at the time so they could buy back their stock with the extra cash.  This makes the value of the stock go up. 

Some return the money to the shareholders as dividends. 

You can find different combinations of these.  Some growing companies may periodically pay a one off special dividend. Others pay a small but routine dividend, and grow or buy back shares depending on opportunities.   Others just keep stable and pay most of the profits as dividends, and as the years roll on with inflation they will try to raise the dividend every year. 

Each of the attract different types of investors so they try to stick with a strategy. For example, retired people like to count on dividends as income so you see utilities finance growth with bonds and maintain the dividend because if they cut the dividend those people would all sell.  Cyclical companies pay dividends in good times and cut it in down cycles.",

**Introduction** 

During a casual scroll through the dregs of Robinhood, I stumbled upon a listing that caught my eye: Future Fintech ($FTFT), a China-based “blockchain e-commerce financial technology company” that’s up an impressive 455% over the past year. Featuring a market cap of \~$500m and share price of \~$5.50 (at the time of discovery), it appeared at first glance to be a player in a hot sector with plenty of room to run. I decided to do a deep-dive into their history, products, and SEC filings as an exercise in due diligence.  

What I found was bewildering – and a great lesson in why doing your own thorough research before investing is vital. Let’s take a look at what I found. 

**A Brief Company History** 

$FTFT wasn’t always a pioneer in one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. Before pivoting to blockchain, e-commerce and crypto in 2018, $FTFT produced and sold fruit juice - yes, seriously - as SkyPeople Foods Holding Ltd. (“SkyPeople”). The carcass of the company dates all the way back to 1998, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on their recent history. 

SkyPeople was brought onto the NASDAQ via secondary offering through underwriters Rodman & Renshaw (featured in the documentary *The China Hustle*), who have a history of bringing sketchy Chinese microcap companies to market and [violating Finra rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/finra-fines-rodman-renshaw-for-analysts-actions.html). Interestingly, SkyPeople settled a [$2.2m class action lawsuit](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf) (.pdf link) in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1,000%** and failing to disclose a **related-party transaction** involving their former CFO, Yongke Xue (now board chairman), to shareholders. 

According to their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm), the transition to their latest business focus hasn’t been going so well: “The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised **substantial doubts about its ability to continue** as a going concern” (pg. 7). As of September 30, 2020, positive operating cashflows were predominantly related to stock compensation and discontinued operations – not their stated core business (pg. 3). The quick ratio for their 3Q2020 financials (0.057) indicates that the company doesn’t have adequate liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities. 

  
Compounding their troubles is a **subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement** issued on February 21, 2020, addressing their accounting practices, management oversight, and the sale of one of their subsidiaries (pg. 16). Note that this critical piece of information is missing from their website’s [news page](http://ftft.top/en/news.html). 

Their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm) \- the last one filed with the SEC - details their routine, schizophrenic changes in name and business focus since 1998, as well as their suspiciously complicated and web-like organizational structure, portrayed on a [chart](https://imgur.com/PNFqHLj) (pg. 4) featuring font so small that it’s impossible to read.  

In addition to being an industry leader in juice production and blockchain technology, $FTFT is also an innovator in taking out loans, leases, and service contracts, defaulting on them, and getting slapped with judgements in court, boasting an impressive record of [**20 defaults and lawsuits**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006) in six years (2014-2019, pgs. 42-45).  Furthermore, they’ve regularly been in danger of being delisted by NASDAQ due to their **persistent failure to file reports on time** (pg. 40). 

Now that we’ve scratched the surface of this industry heavyweight’s complex history, let’s examine $FTFT’s products and services. 

**Blockchain, E-Commerce, and Crypto – Oh My!** 

According to $FTFT’s website, [www.ftft.top](http://www.ftft.top/), their core revenue generators revolve around blockchain-enabled e-commerce. We’ll take a brief, critical look at each of them below. 

**“Chain Cloud Mall”,** AKA “GK Shared Mall” ([www.gksharedmall.com](http://www.gksharedmall.com/)), is described on their website as an “...innovative B2B2C e-commerce platform created by well-known investment bankers, e-commerce and blockchain technology industry elites, financial technology experts, and sharing economy scholars."" In reality, it appears to be a standard, boring retail platform, absent of any evidence whatsoever that blockchain & fintech “experts” and “scholars” were involved in its creation, or that blockchain technology is even in place at all. It’s replete with dead links and has seemingly little engagement. In fact, according to their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm), it generated an abysmal **$0.54m** in revenue from a total of **6,401 users**. 

**“NONOGIRL”** is a “cross-border e-commerce platform” that, in reality, appears to be a standard-web auction site that was seemingly [abandoned 7 months ago](https://imgur.com/aH4B94h) according to the NONOGIRL LinkedIn page. It’s unclear if the site was ever launched; searches on [www.baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com/) and the Google Play Store return no direct results to the platform. 

**“DCON”** is a “blockchain-based application incubator and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets” that appears to be dead in the water, as [the associated coin never appears to have been released](https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R). No development updates are available on $FTFT’s website for either the “incubator” project or the DCON platform itself. 

**Conclusion** 

All publicly available evidence points toward this name being an incredibly risky investment with a hefty amount of downside looming overhead. Major red flags abound – and to those holding long positions in this company: **invest with caution**.

m5kkxa,,investing,post,1615814594,"Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

m58453,,investing,post,1615767209,"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely workedhttps://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",['TGT']

m592rq,,investing,post,1615770312,"Equity-Based Dollar-Cost Averaging: Methodically Buying Dips and Taking Profits Anyone who spent some time studying the basics of investing knows about dollar-cost averaging. If anyone needs a refresher, here's a short analysis between lump-sum versus averaging by Vanguard: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum).

Vanguard makes a compelling case about market timing. Assuming a retail trader can't time the market (even if you don't support EMH, it still is obvious that this is pretty darn difficult), you may believe it's simply for those who are scared of realizing losses, which is exactly the point they make.

I would like to propose a slight tweak to the concept: instead of spreading the payments out over time, spread them out over price. You start with an initial exposure, and scale up when the market takes a hit, while scaling down to take profits during bull runs.

Let's demonstrate why this works out. Take a random price point the SPY has reached in the past: 250 USD. How many times did it reach this point? Five times. Take another one, 270 USD: **ten times.** How about 290 USD? **Fourteen times.** But maybe that's just a recent trend. Things might've been different back when it was around 100 USD, right? Nope, **ten times it reached 100 USD.**

I haven't conducted an elaborate backtest, but it's clear the amount of setbacks to any particular price level is rather large, just as it's clear the whole thing is positively drifting in general.

Given that we know this, instead of investing 100% at once, consider what would happen if you invested 60% at 100 USD and invested an extra 20% for every 10% drawdown, and scaled down by 5% for every 10% increase? In other words, we scale up by double the drawdown, and realize half of our profits.

Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash. We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

We could continue to test and demonstrate this, but the point is clear; we all know this will generate less returns in a very strong bull market, and create very strong opportunities in bear markets. We profit when bull runs are facing continous corrections, when the market goes sideways with some swings in between, and we are extremely well-protected against crashes, able to purchase lows and hold whole multiples of shares compared to when we'd just lump-sum.

It's no coincidence the greats such as Warren Buffet hold so much of their available capital in cash and play the waiting game on crashing markets. Ask yourself: when the markets crashed by 50+% over the course of their history, did it ever correspond with a similar collapse of the global economy? Not really, jobs were lost, consumer spending took a hit, some companies went under, but at a global scale we never took a hit even in the same universe as the rate at which the market tanks during those times.

So what's your take on this? Is this even considered ""dollar-cost averaging""? Are there superior alternatives? Or would you consider / are you already applying this in your actual investment strategies? Would very much like to further my knowledge on this topic.",

m5czmg,,investing,post,1615783643,"$SESN (Sesen Bio) D&D huge incoming catalysts with mayor impact on bladder cancer.
Today I´m bringing you all my third D&D. There will be no technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some information research and maybe you find it helpful. 

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

Before you ask, I currently hold 3652 shares at an average cost of 2.32.

**About the company:**

Sesen Bio is a late-stage company developing fusion protein medicines. Their fusion protein approach tethers a tumor-targeting antibody fragment to a protein cytotoxic payload to form a single protein molecule designed to selectively and broadly kill cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells and to activating the body’s innate immune response system.

**What are they doing and why I think it´s important:**

The company is initially focused on the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Their main drug is it’s called **Vicineum.** This is being evaluated in the [**Phase 3 VISTA** trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02449239?term=vicinium&rank=1) for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have been previously treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the current standard of care for NMIBC. While BCG is effective in many patients, challenges with tolerability have been observed and many patients will experience recurrence of the disease. If BCG is not effective or a patient can no longer receive BCG, the recommended option for treatment is radical cystectomy, the complete removal of the bladder.

*In case you ask how many people are vaccinated with the BCG feel free to click this link:* [*http://www.bcgatlas.org/*](http://www.bcgatlas.org/)*.*

The preliminary findings are highly encouraging, demonstrating that treatment with Vicineum results in clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability. In addition, the data are consistent with the results of Vicineum in their completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

&#x200B;

**Vicineum** can potentially treat **head and neck cancer.** They have completed Phase 1 trials for an injectable form of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN that have demonstrated anti-tumor activity and safety. Data from these trials also demonstrated that certain patients who were injected with Vicineum in one tumor had responses in non-injected tumors as well, suggesting that Vicineum may promote an anti-tumor immune response and combine well with immunotherapies. In addition to the Phase 1 trials, Sesen Bio completed a Phase 2 trial in the United States, which demonstrated a reduction in the bidirectional size of the principle targeted tumor observed in 71 percent (10/14) of patients evaluated in the study.

**Some important fact about Bladder Cancer:**

\- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. If BCG is not effective one of the options is **complete bladder removal.** Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer, but options for treatment have not changed in more than 20 years. At Sesen Bio, they want to help you save your bladder. **Vicineum**™, is administered in the exact same way as BCG but works differently and may offer a new option.

\- This year, an estimated 83,730 adults (64,280 men and 19,450 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Smoking accounts for 47% of all these cases.

\- Bladder cancer mostly affects older people. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are older than 55. The average age people are diagnosed with bladder cancer is 73.

\- The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The general 5-year survival rate for people with bladder cancer is 77%. If the tumor is invasive but has not yet spread outside the bladder, the 5-year survival rate is 69%. Approximately 33% of bladders cancers are diagnosed at this stage.

\- **Potential for Peak Revenue of $1B - $3B Globally for Vicineum**

Substantial US opportunity and OUS potential of roughly two times the US.

An anticipated virtuous cycle of advocacy across physicians, patients/caregivers, and payers to drive rapid uptake and strong growth after approval and launch.

Compelling intent to prescribe research in the US.

A highly concentrated US market of \~1,500 Urologists treating \~75% of BCG patients allows for efficient targeting.

\- **Key partnership with leading partner in MENA (Hikma Pharmaceuticals)**

A public company headquartered in London with a market cap of >$6B and >$2B in annual revenue.

The fifth-largest pharma company in the MENA region trusted and leading licensing partner in the region and extensive regulatory affairs capabilities.

**My opinion on all this:**

Vicineum appears to be the new great thing around bladder cancer, numbers are showing to be great and this is close to receiving an FDA response which is expected to be positive. This is the 6th most common cancer and if the BCG fails the most common treatment is bladder removal. Sesen is trying to avoid this by providing a great solution. The company is partnered around the world to provide this once approved and is aiming beyond the USA. The balance sheet looks impeccable, no debt, 44M free, indicators look great for the short, mid, and long-range with a huge upside on a price target. 

I see this having some big news soon and driving the price very high up. 

Another important thing is that there are not many videos or spam around it so the price isn´t pumped in my opinion. 

There is a BCG shortage which might help Sesen Bio get their drug approved even faster. This shortage has been going for some years now. 

I will not buy more shares as I already own a lot but I see this as a great investment.

Even on really simple cases of a few shares bought a year ago and never traded at any point later, the cost basis is just... wrong?

# Understanding the eVTOL Space

(Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag)

Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a moo*o* point.

Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the *same per mile as a ground-based ride share*.

Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check [this article](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/evtol-air-taxi-flying-car-market-players/) to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) *or* are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded [DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lwj8rs/a_world_of_evtols_a_comparison_of/) that I highly recommend checking out.

The United States is acutely aware that it ['missed the boat'](https://www.osinto.com/post/agility-prime-the-pentagon-s-evtol-power-play) on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the [Department of Defense.](https://dod.defense.gov/) Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched **Agility Prime**, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their [website](https://agilityprime.com/index.html?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=AgilityPrime#/) here and highly recommend reading this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-flying-cars-could-take-off-soon-if-we-let-the-military-help/) by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from *the Jetsons.*

The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a **TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM**, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario.

Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at **$1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S**. Joby Aviation cited the [2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/bah-uam-executive-briefing-to-post.pdf) for its forecasts.

Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities:

1. **Batteries!!** \- Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's *ludicrous* mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. [Alakai Skai](https://www.skai.co/)'s (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services
2. **Certification** \- These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause.
3. **Safety** \- To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. *It will be complicated to write software* to reliably control all that, [says Ella Atkins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/02/10/lilium-evtol-spac-air-taxi/?sh=33d80b54627c), an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. *“You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,”* says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone.
4. **Air Traffic Control** \- Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of *skyports/ vertiports* dotted around an urban area.
5. **Public Perception** \- Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, *“*[*lasing*](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws/)*”* of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only.

All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space:

1. **Joby Aviation - $RTP** (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play)
2. **Blade - $EXPC** (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play)

# Outlook for EXPC and RTP

**Blade - EXPC**

[Investor's presentation](https://brs-apartments.flyblade.com/blade/production/uploaded-assets/1608040247.pdf)

* **Blade is an eVTOL index play**, often thought as the *""*[*Uber of skies*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-small-aviation-tech-company-will-turn-into-the-uber-of-the-skies-2021-01-11)*""* operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform.
* **Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable**; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products.
* There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to ***selling shovels in a gold rush.***
* Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. **This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow**.”
* **Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities** that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent).
* **Blade operates in four key lines of business:**
   * *Short Distance* – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders).
   * *BLADE Airport* – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 .
   * *BLADE MediMobility* – **Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States**, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers.
   * *International Joint Ventures* – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. **Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India** flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi.
   * The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo).
* **Blade's projected revenue outlook**:
   * Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million.
   * Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. **This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026**. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then.
   * But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt)
* **Blade's Competitive Moat**:
   * **BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility.**
   * **#1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets**, brings credibility to new market expansion.
   * **Strong management team with domain expertise** and public market experience.
   * **BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies** to generate attractive growth opportunities.
   * Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables **flight volume growth** and **accelerates launch timeline for new markets**
   * While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and **it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost** (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.
* **ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares**, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares.
* **Leadership:** Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.
* **Board of Directors** upon completion of transaction:
   * Eric Affeldt, Chief Executive Officer of Experience Investment Corp. and previously CEO of publicly-traded ClubCorp
   * Jane Garvey, former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

   * David Zaslav, Chief Executive Officer of Discovery, Inc. and Director of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., and Grupo Televisa, S.A.B.
* **Investors - Strategic / Institutional Venture Capital:**
   * **Airbus**

# What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth

**Blade - EXPC**

* PF shares outstanding: **82.5 million**
* EXPC SP as of 03/14: **$12.9**
* SPAC Cash = $375MM
* 82.5MM \* $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap
* PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash)
* Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is **7.4x.** On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers.
* Unadjusted:
   * 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be **$402MM** (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number).
   * This means that the **unadjusted** **EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales**. That is very low.
   * This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$3.35 billion**.
   * That is **215%** **above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61**
* Adjusted:
   * We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The **present value sales number is $230 million** (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%).
   * As a result, the **adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x** (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million).
   * This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$2.077 billion**.
   * That is **95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2**
* Average between adjusted and unadjusted:
   * Target market value is $2.713 billion.
   * **Fair share price: $32.89**

**Conclusion:** ***EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9*** *(As of 03/14/2021)*

This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement.

**Joby - RTP (Speculation)**

* It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.)
* Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of *saving a billion people an hour a day.*
* Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months.
* Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months.
* ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category.

# How I am playing EXPC and RTP

* Catalysts:
   * ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play
   * EXPC - A lot of spec predictions [floating around](https://mobile.twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1368222379080638467) about the shareholder vote on 3/31
   * Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound.
* Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow.
* I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well.
* Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting.

**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor**, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

In other words, I think this space has a lot of potential to become something of a future bubble / hype sector, but also become a very real and profitable space as well. I like the long term potential of EVTOL more than electric cars since I believe there will be far better moats here with a lot less competition. Also has some potential for future crossover with defense industry.

Not saying I would go whole hog on this, but I picked up some warrants as a speculative play on RTX after the SPAC shares crashed back to being close to the initial $10 value.  In my view, the long-term warrants (expire in 2027) present an opportunity for a LOT of upside, where the downside is not necessarily that high.

In other words, I think that ***right now,*** the risk assymetry is heavily skewed to the upside.

That being said, unless WSB catches onto hype in this sector, I'm not sure I would want to play these short term. I would not buy options on these here personally. Overall, I think the macro headwinds to growth stocks is going to be a little bit tough over the next  few quarters. It'll probably help that these are small caps, but I still think these are best viewed as speculative long term call options on a potential new disruptive technology.",['RTX']

Through this latest phase, the company has invested in additional options that allow shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

Schneider has expanded its technology lineup of Schneider FreightPower, first announced mid-year 2020, to help shippers save time and increase their access to capacity. The company rolled out the accompanying app to carriers in Fall 2020.

Through this latest phase, Schneider FreightPower aims to provide shippers with options to manage their businesses right at their fingertips. The digital marketplace allows shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

“Our goal is to make Schneider FreightPower the digital access point for services and solutions for both shippers and carriers,” said Mark Rourke, president and CEO of Schneider. “Shippers of all sizes come to us with their toughest transportation challenges, and we are solving them faster than ever before. That means our customers get more value – and get more done in a day.”

Schneider FreightPower offers access to tools such as:Instantly quote and bookFreight visibility 24/7 (load in process, last location, pickup and ETA), including email notifications (pickups, deliveries, and specific order completion)Access to load documentsReal-time reporting


“Schneider FreightPower is an exciting, new way to differentiate Schneider and connect to small shippers and carriers which represent a $1.2 trillion segment of the transportation market,” said Rourke. “We are giving shippers time, solutions and the best at what we deliver— access to full Schneider capabilities and options. It’s all about improving capacity, so shippers can do business better than ever before,” said Rourke.

m5s8un,,investing,post,1615835255,"$IGIC is a sleeper company that is DEEPLY undervalued 

**$IGIC (commons) & $IGICW (warrants)**

* Growing at 31% YoY
* Extremely Moaty Specialty Insurance Business
* Family-owned company (\~29% of outstanding shares)
* No debt
* Not affected negatively by Covid (so not dependent upon reopening)
* Specialized insurance (high profit margins)
* Insurance rates are the highest they've ever been (we're seeing 20-30% gains in premiums)
* Profitable
* 20 Year old business
* Founder still very active in the company (he's 87)
* Pays a dividend
* $380m in cash (their M.C. is $345m CRAZY)
* Repurchasing shares
* Has warrants (they're a 1-1 with an $11.50 Strike)

They mainly write insurance in the Middle East (Jabsheh family is well respected and are a real value add. However they've recently added N.A. and did 30m in premiums last quarter).

**Company History:**

I spoke to IR (investor relations) she said she won't leave the company until she fixes the volume problem. She's the only employee that's worked for a public company, so the old guard is a bit difficult to talk with. The owner is a big baller, he's worth 100m all from the company. Started it 20 years ago, he's 87 and still goes to work everyday. You can set up a investor call with him at 8pm at night (his time), you'll catch him smoking a cigar and drinking scotch. Fucking chad.

**So what's the problem?**

A couple of things... $IGIC went public via a SP4C on March 22nd, 2020. The SPAC offering was at \~$10 the market Armageddon that ensued caused them to drop below $7 and they've traded sideways since then. The original investors (Argo Group being the largest one) would like to exit their position but they are unable to for 2 reasons.

1. Lockup period ends in March, it's any day now that the SP4C lockup ends.
2. They won't sell at a loss. Until this thing moves above $10 you won't see a real marketplace exist for it... This stock needs liquidity and we can provide that to create a real marketplace for it.

**Let's talk fundamentals are valuations...**

These types of business' are valued on their book. Let's take a look at where $IGIC stands relative to it's competitors.

As you can see $IGIC is trading a multiple of .87x price-to-book relative to $KNSL which is 10.15x price-to-book. $IGIC is growing almost as quickly as $KNSL. $IGIC is profitable, in it for the long run, growing quickly, and way underappreciated.

**Conservative PT:** $12 or \~1.5x price-to-book

**PT:** $30 or \~4x price-to-book

**Bullcase PT:** \~$70 or \~10x price-to-book

As you can see this is anywhere from a 2 bagger to a 10 bagger. I am very long $IGIC and am excited for the liquidity and volume issues to be resolved. When this has a real marketplace this stock will move... quickly.

**Positions:**

25,000 commons @ $7.5

10,000 warrants @ $.72",['IR']

m4y0mb,,investing,post,1615738368,"Why I think Mohawk Group Holdings ($MWK) is a Great Long Term Play.Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool ""AIMEE"" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and increasing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.

Some of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6

In a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&G, Unilever, etc.).

To put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become ""Super Heros"" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the financials:

Currently at the price of $35\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.

While the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&A targets. Direct quote from earnings:

*""We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&A targets that in total have trailing twelve month’s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month’s EBITDA of $97 million.""*

These deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.

I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.

&#x200B;

It is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:

1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them
2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution
3. Competitors

For the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.

On the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.

To the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.

m4vzjt,,investing,post,1615731956,"Good Rx (GDRX) - is a GOOD investmentOn Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality.","['WMT', 'AMZN']"

When news came out that AMZN was basically going to compete with them, GDRX PLUMMETED.

And since it reached a new peak, its been dropping ever since. And the last peak also coincides with the insider trading window opening up allowing them to sell, post IPO. And this may be ironic but I actually use GDRX on prescriptions and it's AWESOME. But there's one huge caveat and its that pharmacies don't have to accept the GDRX coupon and have denied me more times then have accepted it.

m4ghin,,investing,post,1615672644,"Long commodities, short bonds. Protection against inflation, and the house of cards that is the US bond market.Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

[https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc](https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc) 

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

m4j5zg,,investing,post,1615680574,"Mini-Index Fund Strategy (With Backtested Results)A little while ago I read this article from the WSJ: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871)

The article talks about how since trading fees are so low, and it’s easier than ever to own one share, why not buy shares one at a time. It posed the idea of a mini-index fund that you could make just for yourself. *Rather than buy SPY, just buy one share of each of its components*. I always thought the idea novel when you consider the diseconomies of scale in the asset management industry. So I decided to test out the idea with backtesting.

\-I’ll be testing the mini-index fund strategy with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI)

\-I’ll be using DIA as the comparable passive instrument.

\-Using QuantConnect as my backtesting environment.

\-To simulate round-trip trading costs, I liquidate holdings at end of all backtests.

\-To further try to simulate real-world conditions, all backtests will have some excess cash, but not too much as if a real person was funding an investment account to buy something they already thought out. For example, if you want to buy one share of DIA at $286.00 you might deposit $300.00 in your account. Or if you need $4873.00 to buy one share of all the constituents of the DJI, you might round off your deposit at $4900.00.

**Limitations/Things I’d try to incorporate if I wanted to explore this more**

\- All buying happened at the start of the backtesting period. A more realistic scenario to mimic small retail investors would be progressive buying as time goes on.

\- Fees are based on the IBKR brokerage model, NOT INCLUDING IBKR LITE. I would like to simulate zero-fee trading, but the trick with that is that I’d have to account for costs associated with the sometimes less than optimal trade execution that is known to occur with “free” brokerages. And those costs are hard to measure.

\- I did not use a price-weighting allocation yet. What I would do next is see how an exact copy of the DIA would perform.

\- My Backtest period is not that long. Less than a year. It starts 8-31-20 because that is the date when the DJI components last changed and ends on 3-13-21. If I wanted to spend some money on a data source that provides constituent information on indices, I could make the backtest period longer. There are ways to get that info without paying, but I’m only an amateur at python.

\- DJA is very limited, I’d rather do this test on the S&P500. Once again, need a clean data source to do that without a whole lot of headaches.

&#x200B;

The Results

[Backtest 1 (Benchmark) - 1 share of DIA](https://imgur.com/WYlJjAt)

Here we have the performance of just one share of DIA. I ran a full backtest on the benchmark because I wanted to see the effects of fees and cash drag on performance. Since we dealing with such low quantities a few dollars from either of those would have a meaningful effect. So the number to beat is 12.5%.

For the first backtest I just want to simply see what adding some scale to the portfolio would do. So instead of 1 share of DIA, we have 100. Sure enough, we got more than a whole percentage point in return. Nothing too surprising. The new number to beat: 13.83%.

[Backtest 3 - 1 share of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/syP1yos)

Now we created a portfolio with simply 1 share of every DJI constituent. Its return is very close to the return from Backtest 1 which was 12.5%. I suspect that if you did this strategy with a zero-commission account you might actually beat the 1-share DIA strategy. By how much, hard to say. However, still would be a losing strategy when compared to 100-shares DIA.

[Backtest 4 - 10 shares of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/h2teIea)

Same idea with Backtest 2. I want to see how adding a little scale would change things. Sure enough, performs very closely to Backtest 2 – 100 shares of DIA strategy. Doesn’t beat it, but I suspect it might in a zero-fee environment by just a small amount. Of course, this is also the strategy that requires the most capital to implement just to buy all the pieces. So, it wouldn’t be the most practical strategy for most people.

[Backtest 5 - 1000 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/lVxwWnp)

Since Backtest 2 performed the best, I wanted to see the effect of even adding more scale, this time with 1000 shares. No doubt we have some diminishing returns. We were able to eke out just 1 basis point for an extra 300k of capital.

**Conclusions:**

Based on what I’m seeing, there doesn’t seem to much of a case for the Mini-Index Fund strategy. You’re still better off with just the proper ETF. Not ready to close the book on this just yet. Given time, I would like to test certain conditions that might have the Mini-Index Fund Strategy win at the end.","['SPGI', 'DOW', 'PGR']"

Dividends are where the company pays you in cash (or more shares) for owning shares if it’s company. You should buy some shares in a really strong company and set up a dividend reinvestment program. This is so your cash payments are delivered in more stock of the company. This way you accumulate more and more shares until each dividend payout from just owning the shares will be huge because you own a lot of shares.

ma3co0,,StockMarket,post,1616352983,"DD Valuation of the Next Tesla: Grossly Undervalued bubble stock in the making (VOW, VWAGY)I'll split this DD valuation on Volkswagen into two parts: the Value Play and the Next Tesla Play.

VOW is the actual European stock ticker.  VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.

[Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales and Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025.

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020.  As of March 19, its price-to-sales ratio is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues is €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less cleaner vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, should be worth *at least* €111.0 billion.

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $42 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should be €181.2 billion.

The EV top-up of €111.0 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €292.2 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been $67.70 yesterday, folks!**

The Next Tesla!  Volkswagen!  Das Auto!

Now you might not like Mr. Cooperman but he was one of the chillest people I’ve ever met. And this episode is very educational. He’s donating all his money away by the way. 

He talks about value investing in today’s risky capital markets, how he got rich, risk management, the disconnect between the stock market and economy, his opinion on the GameStop stock surge, and rise of spacs. 

Hi, everyone my name is Logan. I’m 15 years old and just started my second year in high school. I started a business podcast a while ago, with the goal of helping educate students about certain business topics, but my audience has grown beyond just students. Some of my guests have featured the Dean at Cornell University’s School of business, billionaire investors Tim Draper and Howard Marks, Partner at KKR, and college professors. 

I recently released an episode with one of the most successful investors in the world, Leon Cooperman. Mr. Cooperman is often criticized for his views regarding the wealth tax, but when I talked to him he was one of the coolest guys I ever met. He was a smart old man, who wanted to share wisdom. He told me he is giving away all his money by the time he passes. In the pass 9 months he has given away 700 million dollars to charitable causes. 

I don’t receive monetization from these podcasts, I do it out of pure joy and thirst for learning. As many investors say, always keep learning and that’s what I live by. I hope you guys can enjoy the talks as much as I did. I want to make a positive impact on the world, when I’m older and I can start by doing something as little as this. Thank you if you read the whole thing.

What really gets people is the stigma behind EVs. Tesla has the model 3 valued at around $32,000 which is very affordable if you consider that a 2020 Ford escape is $28 000 and I'm sure you could find a cost analysis of both vehicles and compare gas price/electric costs to fuel up both. I told my girlfriend when we get our house and I can afford it I'm getting solar panels, a tesla and the home charging kit and she called me crazy. The argument can be made that EVs will dominate the consumer market within 20 years, especially under the right administration.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
> The bond market’s reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell’s briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
> “This is bonds’ — I wouldn’t call it day in the sun — it’s more like day in the tornado,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “Clearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that’s not the case.”
*****
> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “The bond move has been huge, and it’s starting to scare people,” said Schumacher.
*****
> “There’s been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?” he asked. “There’s no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It’s incredible.”
*****
> # Powell speaks
*****
> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
> # Inflation and the Fed
> There is also some key data.
*****
> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank’s forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year’s numbers when prices fell.
*****
> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It’s a change to the Fed’s ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
> “For the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there’s a consensus problem. There can’t not be tension,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> “They will be trying to clarify the Fed’s message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,” she said. “They will be explaining themselves as economists, and they’ll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.”
*****
> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
> “The market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed’s dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,” said Grohowski.
*****
> “Yet, they’re committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,” he said. “That’s what the market is struggling with. I think it’s unsettling to me to hear words like ‘overshoot.’”
*****
> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‘great rotation’ from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
> “I think we’re in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It’s not over, but I think we’ve seen the lion’s share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,” said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed’s willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike’s comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
> “Inflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,” Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year’s earnings.”
*****
> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed’s economic forecast.
*****
> “If you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It’s too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,” Grohowski said.
*****
> # Bond market direction
> Schumacher said there’s a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

> # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One
*****
> “The stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.” Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard
*****
> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick’s Day! We’ve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here’s to some more today and over the rest of 2021.
*****
> One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ’29 crash, the ’87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn’t do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we’ve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we’ll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
> So what happens now is the logical question? “The good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although it won’t be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls’ side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.”
*****
> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
> “Global growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators” according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “When we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.”
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “The level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country’s below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country’s relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January’s 0.5% pace.
*****
> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI’s value.
*****
> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite’s growth, while manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-picture-3.19.21.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “In recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.”
*****
> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

m9dhhq,,StockMarket,post,1616266278,"Tracking investments.Hello there,

I am somewhat new to the stock market and investing. Please, be kind. I am trying to learn as much as I can. 

So about 2 months ago, after hearing about the Robinhood app and the WSB shenanigans with GME, I decided to look into stock exchange apps/websites. At the moment, Robinhood seemed like the most user-friendly one, to begin with. I signed up and waited about a month to be approved. 

Since then, I have put in about $500 towards stocks and crypto. Along the way, I did more research and realized that Robinhood isn't the greatest place to be for cryptocurrency. I stopped putting money there and am now using Voyager for certain cryptos. Nonetheless, my stocks are still there. 

I decided to open an account with Fidelity as well. My plan is to transfer my stocks from Robinhood to Fidelity. I am aware of the $75 fee for transferring things over. Nonetheless, I will have some stocks in Robinhood that I don't want to move (free one that I got that is useless) and I don't want to sell because of taxes (I also did some small purchases $1-$5 investments to see how stocks worked prior to investing the bigger bucks).  I want to keep my Fidelity for the serious long-term stocks & EFT's... and leave the risky/new stocks on Robinhood. 

Additionally, I have a 401k(through work) and an IRA (NEW, also with Fidelity). Keeping track of all of these different things through different websites seems kind of overwhelming at times. 

What would you guys recommend in order to track all your investments? 

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for your time!",

There are a number of websites (yahoo, sharesight, morningstar, sigfig, marketwatch) that allow you to input positions and track them. There is also specific software out there, but doesn't seem worth it unless you are rally trading a lot. What you choose really depends on how often you will be buying and selling. If you are mostly buying a few positions and holding long term, then any method is pretty straightforward. If you are consistently adding to positions, or trading regularly, then it probably comes down to whatever method is easiest for you to input every position change. Personally I just use the brokerage accounts, then put the totals from each account into excel.

I think to answer your question appropriately, we need more context. What are your top 5 holdings?  What are you considering swapping MSFT?  What is your risk tolerance and time horizon?

I could have cashed out my MSFT shares in 1999 and put it in Amazon (but I didn’t). I could have also put it in Pets.com (but I didn’t). There are companies today growing much faster than MSFT but many won’t be around in 10 years.","['AMZN', 'MSFT']"

m92ura,,StockMarket,post,1616229188,"3rd try to post my Part II MOMO Inc. Analysis Update**Sentiment and Ratings**

Another parallel between MOMO and GME I see is the negative sentiment. Like GME being a cyclical stock, with a multi-year downturn and a multi-year shitstorm, MOMO has had almost 2 full years of bad news. So the sentiment is of course at the bottom and there are catalysts needed to re-price the stock towards the upside potential. The good thing is, the downside is limited due to solid fundamentals.

Also rating agencies add their 2 cents on the stock here and there. The latest downgrade came from Morgan Stanley. Well, those ""experts"" increased their position by 42% at the end of last year and now talk about a price traget of $15:

[NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/c0rn2bbl85o61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=770e0d0be1bdd32342d6b1fb9b3149aa730e6436)

So I don't know what they intend or if their price target follows any agenda, but I think their price target is not right. Their arguments are:

* weaker than expected recovery after the strategic reform and outlook in 2021, potential regulatory risk, and recent rebound in valuation;
* we see a weak 2021 outlook;
* higher revenue sharing ratios for the new contractual incentive programs for golden broadcasters, and some VAS use cases.

Well then why the heck do you load up shares massively in the first place. And these are basically abstract, universal bullshit risks that every company has to face. Like me saying, I wouldn't buy Amazon stock because anti monopoly regulations could split the company, logistic comapnies have raised their prices and Covid will leave people unemployed and broke and nobody buys anything. Universal risks, not false.

On the other hand, they price $BMBL in at $56 implying a $6.5bn valuation, which in my opinion is madness regarding a revenue of not even $500m compared to $MOMO of $2.3bn, basically saying that the company is worth only $3bn.

[FINVIZ](https://preview.redd.it/quesq4jr85o61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=1204e91701714572058c92208d01ca5cf0818e85)

The guy from Morgan Stanley seems to be a Chinese dude at the company and he gave the price target. If you want to know how young Chinese guys value the apps, look at the video Nian Li posted about MOMO on YouTube!

As I said in my previous article, I assume a fair value of the stock of $25-$40. Let me try to test that statement based on additional facts.

**Balance Sheet**

Let's look at the balance sheet as well, this one I did not cover last time. The company has virtually $1.7bn on hands, and (as far as I am concerned) Tantan is on the books for price/goodwill of $735m. Other Long term assets are there with another $705m. All in all you have $3.3bn in assets that are basically cash or can be sold.

Total debt/liabilities of the company is $1.25bn, leaving the equity position at $2.1bn.

If you value a company like this at 1.6 x Equity (current market cap of $3.5bn), you definitely leave out massive potential of the calculation.

Let's say you take over the company, what would you pay for, what would you deduct if you owned the company? I would see:

* Cash on hands
* Assets (Tantan and Momo users)
* Liabilities

Cash on hands is cash on hands is cash on hands: $1.7bn

I would still value each user between $10-$15 bucks: $4.7-$7.1bn

Liabilities is liabilities: $1.25bn

This leaves me at $5.15-7.55bn for 100% of the shares thereabouts, if I could buy and liquidate the company. The leaves me at $25-$37 a share, so I guess the more refined approach makes my first estimate looks pretty damn solid. And it's not going to get more complicated than that!!

Here I am not talking about subjective discounts or premiums on country or political risks, but merely numbers I can cross examine and that make sense to me.

**Other risks**

If you think China is a bad country and the companies and the party there are bad and fraudulent, okay, you can price that in. But to me $MOMO is too simple a company and why would they make up anything.

1. Founder is still heavily invested.
2. The company is pretty conservative and cash producing.
3. Their earnings calls sound true to me.

The company sees that MOMO App has matured and accepts that as fact. So the revenue plateau here is recognized as such and they try to apply new functions there, by saving cash and reinvest.

In the Q3 earnings call they are very open about the fact that MOMO has matured, they have plenty of cash, they are ""prudent"" in M&A activities, etc. What I mean is, those guys seem to be relaxed and in no hurry. If you make shit up, you try to always beat the numbers and try to smokebomb everyone and doing shady shit behind the screen.

They are crysrtal clear also about the fact that Q4 might still be subject to restructuring, optimizing, weak growth, etc. They sound sincere and act like business owners, like ""we need to chill out, save our cash and see how we can grow again from here."" Unlike overpaid coke-nosed-boomer CEOs they take a break and see. Long-term oriented. And of course they want to make money, why do you think they started the whole thing years ago!! Speaking of which...

**Valuation 5 years ago**

Read this article from JUNE 23, 2015 : [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-momo-inc-m-a-yan-tang/chinese-chat-app-momo-gets-buyout-offer-from-ceo-idUSKBN0P31K920150623?edition-redirect=in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-momo-inc-m-a-yan-tang/chinese-chat-app-momo-gets-buyout-offer-from-ceo-idUSKBN0P31K920150623?edition-redirect=in)

""\[bla bla bla\] The offer values the company at $3.6 billion.""

That was 2015!!! MOMO anounced its purchase of Tantan on FEB 23, 2018: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/china-s-momo-to-acquire-smaller-tinder-like-rival-app-tantan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/china-s-momo-to-acquire-smaller-tinder-like-rival-app-tantan)

Tantan was valued at $735m in 2018 and is still on the books at that price. Value that asset with todays prices. Tantan in 2018 had 95m active users. Bumble? Let's see:

[BUSINESSOFAPPS](https://preview.redd.it/ceg3lo1e95o61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c49ceafc954d29a3bba2d466dd5714c206906f7)

So either is Bumble only worth $735m like Tantan or Tantan is worth $7.6bn like bumble. Or it's somewhere in the middle and I am right.

**Conclusion**

So anyway. I still think

* MOMO is significantly undervalued,
* Morgan Stanley should pay me money for doing their homework,
* BUMBLE is a hype stock!

Have a nice weekend everybody!!

m8q2t6,,StockMarket,post,1616185167,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

**Highlights**

* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dropped after China reportedly banned some state and military personnel from using the company's vehicles over national security concerns, according to reports from outlets including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.
* The [U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-to-restore-bank-capital-requirements-as-treasury-markets-130935328.html) that it will not extend a temporary bank leverage ratio exemption past its March 31 expiration date. Leverage ratio put simply, is a regulation that restricts how much money a bank can lend relative to how much capital the bank devotes to its own assets. The exemption that is expiring at the end of the month made lowered the leverage ratio to allow banks to lend out money more easily.
* NFL sold Amazon (AMZN) exclusive rights to stream Thursday Night Football in their platform.

When people post their pump BS ""technical analysis,"" remember that it is BS. Don't believe people. If they mention a ticker, assume they're biased and wrong. That includes  professionals. If you really want to listen to somebody, pay for a well-regarded subscription service.

The videos that are useful are ones that teach how to do technical analysis. And understanding that it is a bit of an art form; there is a lot of subjectivity, and you have to make judgements based on experience. The automated systems for it are not high quality.

Fundamental analysis has to be done in context of the stock price, so you really need to understand the chart; especially volume. Maybe the fundamentals were good last time they filed paperwork, but maybe they've changed recently and there was some sort of news. You have to be able to see that. So you want to be able to at least look at a chart and tell at a glance if it went down on high volume, or down on low volume, and to understand the difference in implications. Same for going up on high or low volume. And going down on high volume, followed by going up on low volume, vs all the other combinations.

Also, smart investors invest in stocks while thinking long-term with a 5-year+ time horizon.

Also, smart investors avoid timing the market.

And, also, smart investors take profits at a certain point.

Ok, so here’s my question... if these are true, then does a smart investor take the money from the profits and keep it as cash until the next dip? 

Does a smart investor move money she makes into a money market account and wait for dips to buy?

These are serious questions - I’m a bit confused as to where the money comes from to buy the dips and during down markets.",

They buy good companies trading at a discount and these opportunities *increase* when the market dips. Smart investors diversify to limit risk so it appears they are gobbling things up when the market dips. 

Now for the main question. When to sell. IMO, you sell when the stock hits a price you don't think it will surpass for a long long time, the company is at risk of going bankrupt and/or they need liquid assets. Otherwise if you did your job right you probably won't need to sell and you can sit back and enjoy dividends and/or stock buy backs.",

Also never invest with money you are scared to lose. You can be up a lot of money and then be in the negative just as much it’s a very fun adventure if you are not afraid to possibly lose it all. But it can be a very lucrative investment!!!",
m8rzhi,grj5o32,StockMarket,comment,1616193143,"Yes, a smart investor keeps cash around for buying opportunities.

However, if she keeps it in actual-cash, or money market, that's a small difference, and opinions vary. Fidelity automatically keeps your ""core position"" in a money market account, so when you sell something you don't have to move it there at all. That does usually earn some extra money.

Personally, I opt out of that and keep my core position in real cash, because I have no idea what the currency markets might be doing in a crash or something, and I don't want another source of volatility. Also, I'm hedged heavily in a VIX index, which will go up if the market crashes, so that means I keep a lot less in cash than would if I didn't have that hedge. Because of this, I often end up with all my money in play while waiting for my swing trades to mature. But if the market crashes, I'll sell the VIX and buy what is down.

When it comes to selling... probably 80% of the times that I wondered, ""this is up, should I sell it?"" and didn't, I should have. Confirmation bias and FOMO are evil emotions that you have to combat. Wanting it to go up more ends up taking a longer time, and I make the most money of quick turnarounds at 5-10%. Trying to find the peak is usually a bad idea; and if you sell and then it goes up more, you need to stay focused on the big picture; you didn't know when that peak would be this time, or the other time, or the next time, so don't feel like you made a mistake. Selling at a profit you were comfortable taking is never a mistake.👼",

You put in a market order. Your brokerage (robinhood) will execute that order when market opens. The stock can be traded over the weekend but after hours trades affect the price of the stock more than during market hours due to reduced liquidity during those times. 

When the market opens the price jump as lots of orders are placed for the opening bell. Your broker will execute your trade as best as they can, which means at the best price they can get you as quickly as they can at market open.

To that end, **I'm sending some good vibes, love, and true positivity your way on a Friday**. This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy.

m8q1t2,,StockMarket,post,1616185092,"Why you should invest in SPACs and what exactly they are. Remember to always do your own DD. It seems like every month there’s a new investing trend taking the investing world by storm— short squeezing, NFTs, and now, SPACs.

SPACs, aka special purpose acquisition companies, have seen a huge increase in popularity just over the last year. In fact, in 2020, there were 237 SPAC IPOs that raised US$79.87 billion, compared to US$13.6 billion raised in the previous year from only 59 IPOs.

So what is a SPAC (pronounced spack), and how should you get on board with the booming investing trend? Let’s break this down.

What’s so special about a SPAC?

Even if you’re brand new to investing, it’s likely you’re familiar with the term IPO. An Initial Public Offering is when a company finally goes public and has its shares of equity available for purchase by—you guessed it—the public. The shares are bought for an exchange in capital in order for the company to raise money.

SPACs have been disrupting the world of IPOs, because in a nutshell, they provide a faster way forward for companies to sell their shares to the public without all the red tape than an IPO involves. But SPACs are attractive to privately-held companies for numerous reasons. 

Simply put, a SPAC is a publicly-traded shell that is made for the sole purpose of merging with a privately held business. And they’re not new, either. SPACs have been around for decades, they just have a bit of a sketchy past, with a reputation for misleading investors into buying into shady companies. Since then, however, the SEC has been regulating SPACs to reduce fraud, and SPACs have been surging big time.

So, what’s all the buzz about? Are SPACs a worthwhile investment? And how exactly does it all work? Let’s take a look: [https://marketbuzz.ca/what-are-spacs-why-are-they-trending](https://marketbuzz.ca/what-are-spacs-why-are-they-trending/)",

If you don't understand SPACs a lot better than this nonsense above, don't even touch them. They're pure speculation, and there are too many of them so many will fail badly.

If you do buy a SPAC, don't buy it if it is over $11; their baseline price is usually $10, and that's what the back-room negotiations for their merger will be based on, so buying a SPAC even at $12 you're most likely throwing your money away.

m8gudu,,StockMarket,post,1616159208,"Goodmorning Traders ... Expiration day big move in store for today... my 3/19/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis 

Good morning Traders, Expiration day big move in store for today... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... [Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 3 19 21](https://youtu.be/YbIiDsZ7qKQ)

📷

Big move instore for today. Keys to today... first is expected move, which on the high end is 401.16 and low end is 386.96. More than not lately we have tagged one end of the expected move. Next is bonds and rates, will they back off enough to get a pop/rebound today. Bonds need to stay above 153’3, rates back off awhile not pushing sharply up thru 17.55. Third are internals: gaps or extreme opening prints will mean a pause for the moment in current downtrend but will be temporary. Forth and probably most important is understanding day structure and identifying that as early as possible. The different day structures are as follows; range day, trend day up, trend day down, and rounded reversal which I like to call trange day. Now the 3 outcomes to prepare for today are 1) we hold support at 388 area with a pause in rate and bond drama we get a pop today toward 393 area. The 393 area will hold another decision.2) we open with a gap down on both the spy and internals we try to retest yesterdays close of 391.41 and fail giving us a down trend day Hold on its going to be a long ride down.3) we consolidate between 391 and 388 areas before breaking higher or lower.

1. we hold support at 388 area with a pause in rate and bond drama we get a pop today toward 393 area. The 393 area will hold another decision. **40% probability**
2. we open with a gap down on both the spy and internals we try to retest yesterdays close of 391.41 and fail giving us a down trend day Hold on its going to be a long ride down. **50% probability**
3. we consolidate between 391 and 388 areas before breaking higher or lower. **10% probability**

Unless we get very extreme openings on internals, I will wait the first 20 to 30 min to identify day structure first before making any additional moves",['GPS']

It’s never really to late if you plan on a long term investment. But my best strategy and advice is to know what you are buying into, don’t just look at a coin and see that it has a low market cap and buy into it. You always want to make sure that what you are putting your money towards is something that has a foreseeable future, or something that you believe has the potential to be something someday. Every coin, crypto, token, etc... has some sort of overall goal or game plan. Make sure that it is reputable. And MOST IMPORTANT.... DONT LISTEN TO HATER, use your own brain, if you have made it this far you obviously have smarts of your own. Take advice, but believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see. Research.

I have a few questions for someone that is brand new to the stock market. I appreciate any and all of you that take time out of your busy and hopefully lucrative day to answer some of these questions.
 
First, I would just like to casually trade on my own without the help of a stock broker. Like, I want to look at a stock, click purchase, enter the amount I would like to purchase, then click submit, and now I own that amount of stock. Same with selling. I understand there may be fees involved at different levels and I am fine with that, but for the time being I don't want to have to tell a stock broker to purchase or sell for me. What is the best (and cheapest) platform for this?
 
Second, what are puts and calls? How do they differ from just buying the stock itself?
 
Next, I am sure someone has broached this subject before, but after the gamestop thing occurred why not get everybody on this sub (or others as well) together and agree to purchase another stock jointly? Like, a stock worth $50 or less per share and cause it to increase, just like with gamestop? Is it not easier and quicker to get a stock to go from say $5 to $100, than it is to get a stock to go from $100 to $150? And then just keep doing this after that new stock hits a pre-determined number. Like once it hits $100 or $150 per share, then a large portion of people get out and move on to the next stock.",

The call or put price is based on the expiration date, underlying value, market volatility and the execution price.

Impossible. Your broker is how your order gets sent to the market maker/exchange for execution, or gets filled in house. 

>Second, what are puts and calls? How do they differ from just buying the stock itself?

Puts and calls are derivatives, meaning they derive their value from the price of the underlying stock. 

They differ because they give you the right to either buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of the underlying. 

>Next, I am sure someone has broached this subject before, but after the gamestop thing occurred why not get everybody on this sub (or others as well) together and agree to purchase another stock jointly?

why do bond yields matter? because the 10-year treasury is now more profitable than the S&P 500 overall dividend yield. this metric means that since april 2020 there was no alternative to investing money except in stocks or staying in cash - now there is an alternative in the fixed income market (even though these pathetically low interest rates still won't keep up with inflation). this is creating large fund changes and reallocations to begin. the most noticable effect is long term risky equities will be dumped first (why? their future earnings / profits are getting cut due to potentially higher costs of borrowing and inflation), and recovery play stocks will be held or pushed higher.",['SPGI']

m80b80,,StockMarket,post,1616100430,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021 

Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks.  Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Her vision for this stock might not make sense to some people and I can understand why. They aren't making profits and if you consider their financials, their stock shouldn't even be valued at where it is now. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, came on CNBC and blatantly stated that if you are not in this company for the long run, it is not for you. I fully agree. You have to have vision when it comes to stocks like this, you have to understand it's potential. And jeez, Palantir has soo much potential for growth.

Palantir is a software company that deals with data. Data will be very important in the future; It will do so many things for companies and it's software is ahead of it's time. 17 years in the making. 17 fucking years in the making, endless amounts of funding by the government to make this technology happen. It really has no competitors that come close to what they are doing. It has happened. They are pushing their technology to the commercial market, they have already signed so many deals and made so many partnerships with BIG companies and government contracts. A lot of clients are actually INVESTING in the company. That speaks for it self. What I find interesting is that Palantir actually has no marketing team... crazy to think about, but it just reassures my conviction in this company. It is just the beginning for Palantir.

Palantir will lead many frontiers in the coming and near future, AI for one. AI is expected to reach 733.6 billion by 2027. If it leads in markets such as AI, imagine the growth Palantir will have. I believe it is going to be one of the few companies that will reach a 1 trillion valuation.

People really haven't realized what this company is doing, and once they do, liftoff ladies and gentlemen, buckle up.

This is just a very basic explanation as to why you should be investing in Palantir. Let me know your thoughts.",

Allied Energy Corporations (AGYP) is making rapid growth over the last 2 months, rising as much as 500%, which led them to make a huge move by hiring an extremely well-known member of the oil community, Curtis William Boyles. to execute their potential lead in the best way possible. It is known that when the oil prices rise, many companies will be looking to invest into expanding their oil production capacity, which will be affordable with the profit they will be making from the rise.

After AGYP rapid growth they decided to make a different kind of investment, to hire Curtis William Boyles, A man with more than 30+ years of experience that is highly respected within the oil sector as an Oil and Gas operations manager and consultant. He will be in looking after all necessary operations, drillings, and water well injection permits. Mr. Boyles will also the judge all potential acquisitions and joint-venture endeavors.

On top of that, AGYP will be rely on Mr. Boyles to manage all planning and operations of property evaluation projects to determine investment potential, development, exploratory findings, Manage infrastructure and property purchases.

On 4 march of 2021 AGYP has signed an agreement with a premier partner in the Texas oil industry to gain majority ownership of two producing oil wells in northern Texas. The company will be having 100% working interest and 80% Net Revenue interest ownership. By looking at Mr. Boyles overall reputation and expertise, it is safe to assume that these 2 wells with AGYP’s growth and huge future potential are in reliable hands.

m7za6w,,StockMarket,post,1616097524,"Emotionally dealing with being a loser as a new investor in the market
I started investing/trading just a few months ago and the mental turmoil is a lot more that I expected, to be completely honest. Losing money in stocks you thought would take off just for them to go red and drain your account is very disheartening. I’ve seen a lot of tickets go up double digits, even triple, in percentage and have given in to FOMO more than I’d like to admit. Nothing is worse than seeing massive gains turn into massive loss. I’ve thought about giving up so many times. I’ll say it right now, I’ve been super disappointed in myself even if I’ve only lost a net few hundred dollars. In a crazy market like this, how are new investors supposed to keep up in this environment? 

This seems like a rant and doesn’t really fit here in an informative way, but it’s easy to dismiss the emotional and mental strength you need to participate in the market. To fellow new investors: you guys aren’t the only ones losing and you are not alone. Take a step back and analyze what you’re doing wrong and learn from your mistakes. Revaluate if you can handle the market and be real with yourself. Personally, I’m taking a break to get away from all of this. It has been eating me up everyday looking at my account and trying to catch tickers that aren’t going to absolutely wreck my account. For one, I need to work on patience and not expect instant gains/free money. If anyone can relate to my experiences, I hope this helps you out in any way and give you motivation to not give up. Please take care of yourself guys, lots of love <3

m89rr5,,StockMarket,post,1616130192,"The 10 year and its effect on the marketIn light of recent events, can someone please clarify how the 10 year effects the markets? I seem to be a little confused.

From my understanding, the 10 year is the prime benchmark that measures investor sentiment across financial markets. If bond prices are down yields go up, that signals that investors feel they can make a higher return elsewhere ( i.e. confidence in the markets) if bond prices are higher and yields are trending downwards it would suggest the opposite. 

My question is this: why did a hike in the 10 year yield spook the market into a sell off today? Rising yield rates indicate that investor confidence in the market is high, right? So wouldn’t we only need to be concerned with lower yield rates? (i.e. low confidence in the market; investors feel that their money is better off in bonds rather than the stock market)",

m8iboj,,StockMarket,post,1616163738,"USEI DD - They have more assets than their market cap, Crypto/CBD/Clean Energy StockHey guys, I made a video of my DD on USEI- this stock is SEVERELY undervalued in my opinion, they have almost twice as much assets than their market cap, check out the video here: https://youtu.be/qTlW60KTlxo

If not, here’s the written DD version:

USEI is a CBD, Green Energy and Cryptocurrency stock. I’m really excited and bullish on this stock since it has multiple things going for it. #1 they have assets worth way more than the stock price is trading at currently, #2 they are about to go pink current which is a huge catalyst, they’ve already filed their financials, now they just need to file the attorney letter, and #3 there are some possible catalysts coming which would be the revealing of 2 companies that they own.


https://usenergyinitiatives.com/

As we can see on their website, they’re focused on MJ, green energy and currencies as it goes forth in the coming years. 

Now, their new plan is what I’m really excited for and I’m sure this will really be the gamechanger for this company. They pivoted from being a primarily MJ focused business, but now they’re looking to focus on Green Energy and Crypto mining. 

Now, the last sentence is what’s really important here. They’re talking about how they have a significant amount of assets in certain currencies that they’ll use to grow their company in the future. 

I’ll talk about those assets in a second, but first, I did want to talk about their industries section, so the first one is Green Energy which they say they’ll be using wind and solar energy to help power their crypto currency operation. This basically means they’re able to provide electricity to their crypto miners for a very low cost, which is honestly pretty unique, having low margins when mining crypto is super important. One NASDAQ stock I’m invested in is CLSK, and they have micro grids that allow them to mine bitcoins at a 90% margin which is insanely high. I don’t know what margins USEI has for their mining operation, but I do like the fact that they’re using these resources to get their costs lower.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/05/1644764/0/en/USEI-Takes-Ownership-of-5-1-M-Sumcoin.html

So like I mentioned earlier, they said they have a significant amount of assets in certain currencies that they’ll use to grow their company in the future. So we see here they announced their ownership of 52.7k Sumcoins in exchange for 3.6million USEI shares. The value of SUMCOIN that they had acquired at the time was worth $5.1 million.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/USEI/profile


Right now, SUMCOIN is trading at $810, let’s use $800 for our calculations, but their SUMCOIN is now worth about 42 million dollars, when the market cap of the company itself is only 26 million dollars. So this stock is super cheap right now, in my opinion.

https://sec.report/otc/financial-report/274349

Now, I know you guys are probably wondering if they still have those coins. There’s another company out there named Coin Citadel, ticker symbol CCTL that’s been leading on its investors whether they still hold Bitcoin from several years ago, but this company on the other hand has their financials updated. This is their balance sheet for the calendar year of 2020, and we can see they have their SUMCOINs as an asset with a value of 5.1 million dollars. Now, that 5.1 million dollars figure is a bit confusing, if we scroll down in the balance sheet, we see that in 2016 they made the transaction to acquire those currencies and were valued at about 5 cents per share and at the time of writing the document they are trading over $400 per coin. NOtE: the overall value of this currency is continually noted at this $5 million evaluation value and will continually be priced at this value until it is sold.

Now, it’s confusing since they said it was worth 5 million dollars when the coin was trading at 5 cents per coin, but in the PR earlier, they said they acquired 52.7k, so I’m just going to assume the value 52.7k is correct.

https://twitter.com/USEnergyInit

So on their twitter, they’ve been talking about how they just filed the first of 5 OTC Market Reports and are in the process to getting back to pink current.

https://sec.report/Ticker/USEI

Now on the SEC filings, we can see that they have 3 quarterly reports and 1 annual report for 2020, meaning all their financials are up to date, and I believe we only need to wait for their attorney letter with respect to current information, which could come any day and is a huge catalyst, so I think that you guys should hop on this stock ASAP, but this is not financial advice.

https://twitter.com/USEnergyInit

Now if we go  on their twitter, there’s 2 interviews with the CEO, feel free to listen to them for yourself, there’s alot of insight that he gives, but I’ll try to give you guys some of the highlights of them. So in the Feb 21 interview, the CEO confirmed they have a significant holding of crypto still which is SUMCOIN, there’s a high possibility of a share buyback, there were some issues that USEI had over the past few years that have all been resolved, and there’s potentially another company that could be working with USEI. He also said that he’s really confident that USEI will do really well this year and there’s nothing stopping them, they said that they do not need any more financing. 

In the February 14 interview, he again confirmed they have their SUMCOINS, and the CEO talked about how they’ll be planning to coordinate with multiple companies and they actually own 2 companies in the crypto space, and possibly a 3rd one soon.

So as a recap of everything, CEO is super confident in the company, the company just changed their plans and is focusing on the Green Energy and Crypto mining industry recently, they have 52.7k SUMCOINS which is worth about $42 million, and they’re getting pink current very very soon. In my opinion, these are all very bullish signs and I personally will be buying this stock, but do your own research, anyways that’s going to be it for today’s DD if you guys liked it and want to hear more research on OTC stocks, feel free to subscribe to my youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHXRDSK_npOQYM0bjcLFhOQ , I’ll catch you guys in the next one, peace out.","['NDAQ', 'TWTR']"

Here is an overview for things to look out for this week regarding GME. Pray that Automod doesn't nuke me again.

🚀 **Option Chain Overview (As Of Close on Friday 3/19)**



Strike | Calls ITM | Puts ITM | Buying Power (# of Shares) | Total C&P ITM | % Calls | % Puts | Spread
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
170 | 5,881 | 6,400 | -51,900 | 12,281 | 47.89 | 52.11 | -4.23
175 | 6,157 | 6,086 | 7,100 | 12,243 | 50.29 | 49.71 | .58
180 | 6,324 | 5,810 | 51,400 | 12,134 | 52.11 | 47.88 | 4.24
195 | 6,778 | 5,302 | 147,600 | 12,080 | 56.11 | 43.89 | 12.22
200 | 7,998 | 4,252 | 374,600 | 12,250 | 65.29 | 34.71 | 30.58
250 | 11,528 | 2,681 | 884,700 | 14,209 | 81.13 | 18.87 | 62.26
300 | 16,747 | 1,118 | 1,562,900 | 17,865 | 93.74 | 6.26 | 87.78
350 | 19,121 | 946 | 1,817,500 | 20,067 | 95.29 | 4.71 | 90.57
400 | 23,057 | 799 | 2,225,800 | 23,856 | 96.65 | 3.35 | 93.30

**Pease note that this option chain will change as the week goes on. This is only a preliminary scan.**

In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.

Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.

[ETF Data Part 2](http://puu.sh/Hr7Vr/abd3aaf1dd.png)

These are the numbers of shorts that HF's can borrow through interactive brokers that disclose their available shorts. This number does not represent the total number of shorts that HFs have that have not been placed in the market. This also does not represent shorts that can be borrowed from undisclosed locations.

Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.

Reminder that shorts need to be covered eventually.

This is the best data I have at the moment. I don't have access to a Bloomberg Terminal or any non-public information. I am not making any assumptions as to where GME will be by the end of the week. I am not telling anyone to make any sort of investment decisions. 

I am here to answer any questions and would be happy to discuss this data further.

m9zf3x,,wallstreetbets,post,1616341736,"EV Industry: a SPAC fueled & fraud filled bubbleSo right now the **EV space** is starting to look **very similar** to what **weedstocks** were **in late 2018**. Incredible hype, unprofitable companies, zero sales, fraud and mismanagement of investor funds.

Related to this, a week ago another EV stonk ($RIDE) was being **alleged of fraud** so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year.

**Disclaimer: This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place. Not financial advice.**

Some  background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018. Roughly three  years ago, back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle  school teacher Ms. Wilson's **bare tits**,  the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and  sending them over the border into Canada. Why Canada? Turns out the **maple syrup sipping beavers**  up there were about to legalize marijuana. Some of the more business  oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their  jobs at Tim Hortons and buy **barns in the middle of nowhere**, setup weed companies and call them cool names like ""Blaze It  Erryday Co"", ""Kush Money Inc"" and ""Aphria Inc"". The empty barns were  publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races! Retards like us  bought everything we could get our hands on, **weed was about to make us millionaires**.

Turns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in.

Sales were **disappointing**, low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable, the **bubble popped** and your boys were left **holding bags** of weed(stonks). Some of these companies are still around, while others are now **lol tier pennystocks**.

I  was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom  era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff  so weedstocks it is. Okay, enough with the history lessons. Here's why I  think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs.

* ""New"" industry with incredible growth expectations from investors.
* A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time.
* Stonks going to the moon
* Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit.

Let's move on to **what's hot with the SEC** right now. I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible. Note: I'm **not touching Chinese EVs**, the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their **spyware** into and declare the winner. Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding, too bad, I'm about to **blast some ass**. I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies.

**Canoo Inc ($GOEV)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not  mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a terrible  looking minivan in 2022. These minivans will be subscription based  revolutionary ""lifestyle experiences"". I need to know what these guys  are smoking.
* The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025, lmao.
* **Rating: Lol tier**

**Fisker Inc ($FSR)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022.
* They're  strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a  'leasing' type of business model, so customers will pay a monthly fee  instead of a big upfront payment. Foxconn has stated they will be able  to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023. Essentially Fisker is  drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver.  3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible, they may have some brain cells.
* **Rating: Crayon tier**

**Nikola Corp ($NKLA)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023.
* CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year. Investigated by the SEC. Also that fake truck video was hilarious.
* Didn't  find any reliable production estimates. The company is allegedly filled  with fraud, which is why I think this company will never mass produce a  car/truck.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021.
* Allegations of producing fake pre-orders and being years behind of schedule. Investigated by the SEC.
* Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024, CEO has stated their factory  has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lucid Motors ($CCIV)**

* Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021.
* Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k.
* Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point.
* **Rating: ex-TSLA tier**

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

* Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your **mommys nipples**. Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits.
* Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models.
* Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions.
* OG memestock. Only EV company that has a **Technoking**.  Incredibly overvalued. Multiple reasons pumping valuation,  Full-Self-Driving & robotaxis being one. Go check the 8.2 beta  videos, that thing is nowhere near autonomous. ""tEsLa iS nOt a CaR  ComPanY"", okay, right.
* **Rating: Meme tier**

**In conclusion.**

Almost every single company in the ""purely"" EV space is **losing money**. Most of them **aren't producing anything**. At least a few of them are producing **fraudulent data**. Some of the founders have **terrible track records**,  look at the founders of GOEV, FSR and RIDE. This is 2018 weedstocks all  over again. Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as  car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV. Even  though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the  other turds in the industry. Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford  and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive  and possibly become legit profitable at some point. If you think the EV  stonk your holding is going to moon this year, go look at what happened  with weedstocks after 2018.

Thank you, have a great weekend and good luck next week!

I know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes.

Everybody doesn't need a self driving car. Nearly every house in the world will have solar panels installed if Tesla can finance something that is made out of tempered glass and produce a roof that never has to be replaced. They'll own the roof/house battery market because they already have the tech, hype and trust to finance it. Questions is how long does it take them to get the infrastructure figured out.",['TSLA']
ma1ao9,,wallstreetbets,post,1616347099,"AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour. 

Why we should be happy with Friday's AMC closing at 13.93. Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.

Here's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.

&#x200B;

[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23166f1766cabe53fee69c8975190469cffa8e76)

That's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).

This share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.

So Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).

But if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.

If a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.

If this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.

Go AMC, go Apes.

Its like studying for the SAT and then someone knocks on the door and tells you, by the way, you are taking the MCATS tomorrow morning. WTF?!

So, apparently PFOF was started by Madoff! I think on the surface it looks legit, but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys, which explains why there is so much buying but it doesn’t move the ticker at all, while sells plummet it in seconds. I guess the SEC looks at this and says, ‘oh cool, this was started by Madoff and is now industry standard, nothing to see here, would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one’? Is this why Wall Street and Main Street haven’t been the same street in a long time? Since 2008? Earlier?

Its starting to feel like Wall Street is one big Ponzi scheme, I know we all know that, but when it happens for real its terrifying! Madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties, how deep does this rabbit hole go, how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole?

This is my favorite part of his Wiki.

""Madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.\[6\]\[7\] The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street,\[8\] which bypassed ""specialist"" firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers."" FUCKING GREAT!!!

Then I went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this. And holy fucking shit, its almost all of them! TD Ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed, and Vanguard who I was hoping to transfer to. And now I got to sweat moving my shares from TD, something that makes me extremely nervous, thinking that I might miss out on the rocket launch I’ve been so patiently waiting on.

Any talk about moving from TD is simply not on here, lots of talk about Robinhood and Fidelity, but any questions about TD and I get down voted to oblivion. So much FUD, so little time...

I remember when Apes figured out shorts were being hid in ETF’s and how big of a bomb that was, this PFOF stuff feels bigger! I don’t think its getting the attention it deserves because we haven’t had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped, short ETF’s, hidden FTD’s etc. Good luck ever getting this talked about in Congress, they can hardly even address Naked Short’s. They are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing Calculus!

I’m so angry and frustrated and I don’t know who to blame. Citadel? SEC? Madoff? Myself for being so ignorant on what’s going on? I’m so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help. I’m just a homeless filmmaker, aren’t real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this? What’s next, I wake up and there is Morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes? Have I become as crazy as all my friends and family think I am about GME? Have we become QAnon? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!!

This really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it, isn’t it? This is Madoff, only this time, Madoff is all of Wall Street!

Is every broker dealing with PFOF a toxic dumping ground? Is it worth it to move from TD? How long will it truly take? Is every broker fucked? Are we all fucked? All of these institutions are saying, ‘hey, trust me with your money, I learned everything I know from Bernie Madoff’.

FUCK! SHIT! FUCK! I want out! And I don’t know who to trust!

I’m angry, scared, exhilarated… Fuck it, no matter what, if I miss the rocket, if it explodes, if it launches me at 30 G’s into the sun, this has been a wild ride and well worth it. I hope I know what I’m doing, I hope that you do too. But, most of all, I hope that this changes things for the better! I hope all of you Apes are rewarded and safe on your Rocket ride!

I’m so confused and don’t know who to trust. The only thing I know is that I believe in the DD and I believe in you fellow Apes.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Peace and HODL!

TL;DR I think Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF feeding off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme.",

**TL;DR: Merrill Edge no PFOF both Stocks/Options or any relationship with Citadel. But it blocked GME/AMC in Jan.... so Fidelity it is.**

There's no payment for order flow for Chase/Merrill Edge/Vanguard/Fidelity/IBKR Pro (not Lite) if you are simply buying and selling stocks.

If you are buying options, then there's Merrill Edge with no PFOF and Chase with near zero PFOF. There's also IBKR Pro but the added fees there in general seem stupidly high for those who don't regularly trade 6 figures.

btw, IBKR founder is the one that is openly against GME. And Merrill Edge blocked GME/AMC on Jan.

[Naked Short Selling: The Truth Is Much Worse Than You Have Been Told](https://www.yerepouni-news.com/2021/02/03/naked-short-selling-the-truth-is-much-worse-than-you-have-been-told/)

Excerpt:

> Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.  They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.

> The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.

> It’s a global problem, but **it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets**, where naked short selling—the process of selling shares you don’t own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‘phantom’ shares—survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

> This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it’s caused billions of dollars in damage.

> Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

Also:

> And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.

Focus:

> Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. **After cratering the shorted company’s share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment** as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

This predatory short activity by hedge funds did, in fact, happen to Canadian pot stocks before the COVID crash last year.

Which other Canadian stocks are being attacked like this?

m9mkzg,,wallstreetbets,post,1616294687,"Palantir: There and Back Again - PT $45 EOFYHi everyone, this is my take on Palantir. I've been writing this for a couple weeks now and decide that I need to get this done today so hopefully it reads well. This post is my personal opinion and analysis. Welcome any questions and constructive feedback. For full disclosure I invest in PLTR and nothing beats doing your own research in addition to reading other people's DDs.

**Deep value investment for the most important software company, PT $45 EOFY:**

I believe Palantir has been and will continue to disrupt not just the software industry but how dozens of sectors and industries operate. What we’re seeing here might be the next Amazon with a company that does not mind short-term losses and invests aggressively to achieve long-term hyper and exponential growth. If you look at companies that shy away from making such a level of investments into technology to please their shareholders in the short-term, such short-sighted actions do no justice for those wanting to hold onto their investments over the medium- to long-term. I am incredibly excited about the recent Titan release with 4 new modules that includes an AI assistant and an automatic reporting tool. My target price for PLTR is $45 EOFY, key modelling assumptions include:

* Palantir will be a +$20bn revenue business by 2030, driven by significant growth in number of customers and revenue per customer, partially offset by 1-2% churn each year. Growth rate +30% over the long-term is consistent with what we've seen with Amazon / AWS and Salesforce. There will be increasing demand for data analytics solutions and full stack operating systems like Palantir as corporate/governments undergo transformations and identify new use cases for the data that they have.
* Gross margin around 74%, in line with most other software companies.
* Exponential growth and margin support by Apollo's automation of the implementation and post-implementation support would enable massive implementation across thousands of large-to-medium-size customers that would otherwise not be possible with the current headcount at Palantir. Like Alex Karp said, software allows small companies to compete against rivals 10x their size.
* EBIT margin will expand to 27% (including stock-based compensation) by 2030. This is conservative when we compare to MSFT which is operating at +35%. I also assume a normalised 18% on sales & marketing which is on the low side if you compare to CRM at 40-45%, but given Palantir's current partnership model I think this is justifiable. 17% R&D and 5% General & admin.
* Significant shareholder dilution going forward. I use a share base of 2.2-2.3B for my per share calculation to factor in the dilution. Assume no share buyback.
* Normalisation of interest rates to 3% and lower beta (basically lower volatility) over the next 10 years.

Note that while my PT is definitely lower than other moonshots on this sub (I'm talking 60/100/150/500), this is based on readily available datapoints, moderately conservative assumptions and assuming investors will not be willing to pay crazy multiples for the stock.

**Management is sandbagging revenue guidance, are we doing the same?** Management has been overly-conservative and this was one of the main factors causing the share price to tank following what I would consider a very positive Q4 and FY20. With 45% revenue growth for Q1 and 30% for FY21, this implies that Palantir has to really mess up a lot of things in one or two of the remaining quarters (y/y growth below 20-30%) to miss or even to just achieve their guidance. Below is an analysis I've done to show if their guidance is true they will grow at \~19% y/y in one of the quarters which isn't great. So it is more likely than not these guys will outperform their revenue guidance by a significant margin this year. With their 2025 revenue guidance of $4bn, I believe this is also very conservative and it is not difficult to believe the annual growth rate can be 35-40% y/y instead of the guided 30% CAGR. By 2030, at the current rate of growth plus a bit of uplift this business can get to $20bn in revenue or even $30bn – such growth is not unheard of if you’ve been following Amazon / AWS and see what they’ve achieved. Also, the TAM for PLTR might be a lot larger than what management has guided (I note from [C3.AI](http://c3.ai/) filing that they estimate their market opportunities to be in the range of $240bn and growing) but of course penetration of that TAM will prove challenging for Palantir.

&#x200B;

[FY21 revenue scenario, Assume Q2 and Q3 both grow at 30&#37; y\/y, this means Q4 grows at 19&#37; y\/y](https://preview.redd.it/4nu7jwnynao61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8bd9288faf885fca364e9e837ee28946216231)

On another note, in FY21-22, we might see a significant number of customers entering the Expand and Scale phases. In 2020, Palantir had been able to acquire 400+ new Acquire customers on top of the existing \~125, making their customer pool 500+ at the lower end. If they manage to convert all of these new Acquire to Expand/Scale that would add +$4bn to their top line, assuming each customer roughly pays $10m a year to Palantir for the software.

**This business can become extremely profitable.** While both Alex and Cathie have focused their attention on investing more into the business by forgoing profitability now, in the long-term all businesses need to be profitable so I don't suggest we ignore profitability completely. The case might be that Palantir can become a lot more profitable than what we currently see with the level of automation Apollo and future add-ons can handle. Operating leverage will also enable PLTR to expand their margins. In a bull case, gross margin and operating margin may expand to +75% and 30-35% respectively as stock-based compensation further normalises in the future. R&D, sales & marketing and other expenses will still grow in absolute terms but will eventually become smaller portions of revenue.

**Future stock-based compensation will improve.** From PLTR’s SEC filing, I was able to get a sense of what the stock-based compensation will be over the next 3-4 years. I forecast stock-based compensation will reduce from $1.1bn in FY20 to \~$414m per year over FY21-23. I also looked at the stock-based compensation expense of other software companies to make sure that there is nothing odd going on with Palantir (see figure below). For my modelling I assume that over the long-term, stock-based compensation will stabilise around 8% of revenue (which is a lot lower than companies like ServiceNow but still above average for well established software companies). Besides the financial, it is noted that stock-based compensation allows Palantir to attract the best people as well as providing their people with incentives to further their contributions to the business.

&#x200B;

**How long is long-term?** With a stock like Palantir, it seems to be the case that Alex Karp's horizon is beyond 5 years, possibly 6-7 years. The trajectory of the stock will likely be sideway for long and moon/mars long into the future. The point when they reach profitability will be key to the moon phenomenon, which I'd say they can be profitable earliest 2023, base case 2025. So just to reiterate the same thing that Alex Karp has said but cater to our short-termism a bit better, if you're a short-term investor with possibly less than 2 years investment horizon in this stock (2 years is at the very least) then I'd go for SPACs or follow meetkevin investments....

**Key challenges to Palantir:**

We know Palantir has a very good product, but there is much to prove with its business model. Below I note some key challenges:

* **Relationship with IBM and Amazon:** It is great that Palantir has been able to secure two very good partnerships with two juggernauts. However, the level of leverage that Palantir can pull in these partnerships is weak imo as Palantir is still very small and has limited capacity to push through sales. Over time, I'd expect Palantir to become increasingly independent from IBM and Amazon, with the two only providing the hardware and cloud infrastructure for Palantir and Palantir to substantially upscale its direct salesforce to capture more share of the market.
* **Competition:** Though we may say the TAM is $120bn, $500bn, $1T or even $2T, it is clear Palantir won't capture the entire TAM. Organisations may continue to use their existing systems or choose another vendor. Palantir's potential customers may not have the same horizon as Alex Karp's and they may opt for quick one-off solutions rather than a long-term commitment to Gotham/Foundry/etc. Such level of inertia will slow down adoption of Palantir's products. There might be other companies jumping into this space. I do note however that it will also be challenging for other companies to compete against Palantir, especially the bigger players as their large structure prevents them from investing sufficiently for what is still viewed as a niche market.
* **Shareholder dilution:** Part of the reason why it seems PLTR share price does not go up as much on green days is the market pricing in the dilution. While we may think the share base to calculate the per share valuation is 1.83B, there's 500-700m more shares that will eventually dilute the stock, lowering the per share valuation (assuming no share buyback). This factor is also the main driver of the discrepancy in the PT that people have for PLTR, not really revenue and operating income by themselves alone. I note that this dilution is common for many companies but it is however very significant for Palantir. Valuation needs to consider dilution.
* **Transparency into financial disclosures:** Palantir currently does not have the best disclosures in their 10K/10Q/S1 if one has spent time looking at other software companies' SEC filings. For one, there is no breakdown between software and services in their revenue which makes it hard to understand how much of their revenue is coming from the actual software. The stock-based compensation structure is difficult for investors to grasp that somewhat have hidden the significant level of dilution that we're going to see in the future (that compounds with the investor base dominated by retail). The Acquire/Expand/Scale disclosure does not exactly show how many customers have moved from Acquire into Expand and so on. Overall, Palantir can do a lot better in their financial reporting.
* **Public relations:** In my opinion Palantir has not exactly done its best in terms of communications to its investors and obviously maintaining good relationships with the media and Wall Street. While Alex Karp may like the fact that retail investors are dominating the base, I think a more balanced investor base with growing interest from institutional investors will be healthy for the stock (which is actually what we're seeing more of). Good relationships with Wall Street will be key in balancing the investor base. This is not saying PLTR to forgo all of its long-term values but rather they should engage with Wall Street in more regular and healthy debates that will benefit both Palantir and the St, and giving the St more opportunities to understand the company better. This is also not saying Wall St should all put BUY ratings on PLTR because they have the right to have their own view, but a good relationship will give any PT and rating a more objective touch. In terms of communications, I envision Palantir to somewhat move in the direction of Salesforce which has done very well in this regards by developing free online courses and low-code/no-code chill-out conversations that investors/layman can jump in. This would further Palantir along the adoption curve and make Palantir a household name. Recently, the Titan release is not known unless someone goes through multiple loops to find the link so such release should have been announced publicly either via the News section or on Twitter.

**Palantir is still trading cheap compared to some of the recently listed software companies**

Price/Sales or P/S is the key metric for a company like Palantir. Anyway, you can see that Palantir is trading cheaper than 6 other companies at 41x (Snowflake, Crowdstrike, Roblox, Zscaler, C3 AI and Datadog), 4 of which have an average BUY rating from analysts. One thing to bear in mind though is that the whole tech sector has been trading rich for a while now so it is uncertain at this stage to know whether there will be a correction/normalization of multiples in a rising interest rates / inflationary environment. In other words, will 20x P/S be the new normal? Or +40x P/S will be here to stay, let's hope for the latter.

&#x200B;

**Upcoming catalysts:** Demo day in April, Q1 result end of April / early May, FDIC competition result hopefully April.

Thanks everyone for reading this and again I welcome any questions and constructive feedback. Going forward, I'd continue to monitor the stock and might come up with another DD (if anyone has an idea then let me know). One key area that I'd be interested in would be corporate governance and benchmark that against other practices in the software industry.","['IBM', 'MSFT', 'TWTR', 'TGT', 'AMZN', 'CRM']"

This time with pretty shapes!Hi all! I made post yesterday about the bullish/bearish trends that GME exhibited in the past 4 months. I wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes I found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns.  🌈🐻  thesis included.

First, here is where we are with some lines drawn in:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2m0xkmipu8o61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdb729fb4541e134f9605ee40be674451ac3441

Second, according to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:

1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**
2. **Cup:** The cup should be “U” shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A “V” shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ½. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little weary.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again?** We fell from around 340 to 173, at one point. However, if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored, it would be 275 to 201. This is only a 27% drop and a 33% drop would be 183.15.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. **Almost there**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Maybe one day?**

Okay now let’s look at just the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ru5bg80yu8o61.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=16083754a6dbdef77db377f2eadac0e28b7f68ea

So we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here. It is also backed with decreased MACD momentum, slight overselling (W%R trending down), and signs of a DMI convergence (evidence of bearish sentiment). We will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks. If one forms, then that further confirms bearish sentiment.

Looking back at our handle rules, we can see that a handle must be formed in 1-4 weeks, and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago.

Knowing that our bear trends for GME usually last 6-14 days, the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation.

The only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume. Then GME go boom boom.

Evidence of cup with handle pattern: two high resistances with a low “U” shaped support in the middle. Formation of 1-4 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines. Handle supported by W%R, DMI, and MACD.

Potential reasons cup with handle might fail: Price fell too low out of expected range during “U” formation. Potentially, price might fall too low during handle formation, and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle. Also, there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 3/16-3/19. I have not analyzed it much yet, but it was pointed out to me by another redditor.

Edit: Added one more potential reasons cup with handle might fail.

Edit2: Removed links.

Edit3: My bad yall! As pointed out in comments, not descending triangle as that is a continuation pattern not a reversal pattern. Changing it to say ""downward trendlines"" instead, cant change the title unfortunately LOL what can i say im retarded

Someone please look at the options distribution for 4/16 and tell me what you think it means.

From Fidelity's option chain table: PUTS EXPIRING 4/16/21 in order of Open Interest quantity and including dollar values if ITM - NOTE these are just dollar values of the shares if exercised, it is not the dollar value of the CONTRACTS representing the shares. I need to eat more wax fruit to unlock options math level 2.

all the rest are under 10k contracts OI, with the top being the 7 dollar strike with an OI of 8,444 - representing 5.9m USD worth of shares if ITM

honorable mention due to dollar value - 200P 4,048 OI = $80.96m

This is where it gets wack, because the calls are all anticipating a moon, but do not have anywhere close the open interest of the puts despite having very similar dollar values if ITM. The 800C far outstrips any others with a whopping 15,581 OI ($1.24 BILLION WITH A B worth of shares if ITM), the next highest being the 400C at 4,582 OI ($183m if ITM), and all the others (100,200,300,500, etc.) have roughly 4k OI or less.

Is this the day of reckoning??? If hedges were betting Ch. 11 filed by April 16 that represents 353.6 million dollars worth of shares now ITM, no telling how much was paid in premium to acquire those. The value of the top 2 call strikes (If GME were 800+) represents a quadruple return over the 353m if GME were at zero.

Whats the alternative? Based on this, it seems to me like they are going to ride this squeeze and cash in the options and make a profit 100x what any retailer will -*from their own mistake*\- and the manipulation over the last few months is what enabled it. My gut tells me that most retailers dont have the cash to mess with options in these quantities due to IV spiking premiums.

&#x200B;

What do you think is more likely now - the puts go out of the money and the calls print, hedge funds make fat $$$ off recent their recent big bet to acquire tons of high strike calls... OR Hedges original bet of GME hitting zero was actually correct and the puts print? This does of course mean that GME must hit $800/share or higher for the options to be cashed in...

m9i1at,,wallstreetbets,post,1616279915,"GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DDIn the comments of [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/) by u/yodisc I saw some commenters mentioning that this is looking similar to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze, so I did some digging and I'm here to share what I found with everyone today. 
&#x200b;  
#GME Graph and Shorts  
First, let's look at the graph of GME. According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  
&#x200b;  
Now, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#TSLA Graph  
Now, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     
&#x200b;  
Towards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  
&#x200b;  
Tesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#Is This Similar?
Based on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   
&#x200b;  
It is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  
&#x200b;  
#Unknowns
Now, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   
&#x200b;  
I would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  
&#x200b;  
If you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    
&#x200b;     
From this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.

m9i1at,grn80a9,wallstreetbets,comment,1616282764,"The Melvin data point is very important. 

Selling puts is a great strategy when you are short big as it ensures you can get shares back to close your position without having to go into the float to find them bumping the price. 

Melvin is double fucked, because GME is not going to where they sold those puts. 

Citadel is fucked because likely shorted $GME and then turned around lent those shares to Melvin to naked short $GME.

Citadel is also fucked because they sold calls, which are likely naked at this point.

Blackrock and every other institutional owner could potentially be fucked if they call their shares back, triggering a MOASS and melting other parts of the market down via mass selling of longs. 

They just keep kicking the can down the road.

Meanwhile, the market continues to become gamma negative as everybody knows this, QQQ, SPY & IWM all have a massive short interest and 2+ put/call ratio. 

Also, Citadel has enemies that would love to see them go under as well. Mainly SIG international and virtual financial who compete for order flow.

ma2lla,,wallstreetbets,post,1616350851,"A few big catalysts for BUS are scheduled for March 24. Here's a couple reasons I like this stock.Grand West Transportation Group (TSX:BUS) is an electric bus company out of Vancouver BC. Electric vehicles are a hot sector in a slump right now, which creates unique opportunities for getting in at low prices.


BUS currently only trades on TSX, but on March 24 it will begin trading on NASDAQ under a new name: Vicinity Motor Corp. 


Now this all sounds very promising, but the biggest catalyst I see is this: they're issuing a 3:1 reverse share split. Right now, shares outstanding equal 85.95M with 65.75M free floating. This share split will leave it trading in NASDAQ with just 28.65M shares outstanding, at a price of $7.92 if we go by the current share price. 


This seems severely undervalued for a company that has the opportunity to take on public transit orders from government contracts. Oh, did I mention they partnered with BMW to power their new bus line? They also signed a state-wide contract for New Mexico back in February,  and I forsee a few more of those in the near future.


Also, I forgot to mention: on March 24th BUS will be presenting at the Q1 Virtual Investor Summit hosted by Investor Summit Group. 


TLDR: 3:1 reverse split for NASDAQ entry under new ticker and brand on March 24, partnered with BMW, electric public transit, manufacturing plant opening in Atlanta by Q4, Investor Summit presentation on split/NASDAQ entry day, undervalued compared to other EV stocks on the market.


But don't take my word for this, do your DD. This is my first DD, so I apologize if anything is wrong in it. I'd love to hear your opinions on how I could do better research, or key things to look out for.


Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. I'm just a retard that thinks BUS is a good stock right now.

m9iu6u,,wallstreetbets,post,1616282442,"What Do Bonds and Yields Mean?I have noticed that a lot of here can't read so of course I decided to write up about Bonds. Who cares nobody is going to read it anyways.

A bond is a loan. When you buy a bond from an entity, you are essentially loaning them your money.  like any loans, a bond has a face value ( principal) and coupon rate( interest you get for loaning the money until the loan matures). So when I buy a $1000 bond, let say for the face value which is $1000 and a coupon rate of 2%( a year), it means  I will get 2% of the principal which is $20 yearly and at the end of the term when it matures I get my principal back.

A bond yield ( there are different ways of calculating this but for the most part you need to know yield to maturity rate)  =  annual coupon payment / bond price. so for the example above the yield is the same as coupon rate of 2%.

So reading this you might ask yourself that why the yield fluctuates. Referring back to the yield formula above, for yields to go up, either the coupon amount has to increase or the bond price needs to drop. coupon is usually fixed so the only way the yields can go up is for the bond to depreciate in price. Remember regardless of how much you pay for a $1000 bond, you will get the same coupon payment and $1000 principal at the end.

Imagine you are selling a car  and you have a buyer who is willing to pay $9500 and your friend asks you if you would sell the car to her and she will pay you $10000 in a year. Is this a fair deal? In order to answer this question you need to determine how much $10000 a year from now is worth today aka present value(PV) of future cash (FV). This is a fundamental concept in putting a value on an assets(long duration) like stocks or bonds. In simple terms, what you do is to look at the rates for a one year loan and let's say it is 5%.

PV of $10000 = $10000 / (1+0.05) = $9523

so if you wait a year you get more money for your car.

&#x200B;

In the example above, I assumed there was no inflation ( =0). but what if the inflation is 2%?  Let's do the same PV(present value) calculation only considering inflation:

PV + PV\*Inflation = $10000 (FV) so PV = 9803.

&#x200B;

so now considering both rates ( interest rate + inflation):

PV +PV\*interest + PV\*inflation = FV -> PV = FV / (1+ inflation+interest).

So going back to the car example and including inflation:

&#x200B;

PV = 100000 / (1 + .05+ .02) = $9345.

So, with inflation,  now the 9500 offer sounds better than 10000 next year.  The higher the inflation, the lower the PV of a future cash flow.

&#x200B;

This is the main reason for the all the volatility in the past few weeks. As the inflation fears grow, people start discounting the value of 10 year treasury notes to PV and realizing that it is not worth it to pay as much as last year to buy the bonds because of the fear of erosion in the pv due to an inflation hike and are paying less to buy bonds and that causes the bond yields to go up.

&#x200B;

A similar method is used for stock valuation to determine the PV of future cash flows of a company. in this process, an investor determines the PV of  the future earnings (cash flow) of a company and based on that calculates a fair price. So for the growth stocks where most of the cash flow is in the future, the the higher the inflation the lower the PV of those cash flows and hence you see multiples on those stocks drop.

So in high inflation environments, value stocks are preferred since a good chunk of their earnings is happening at the present especially the ones with pricing power. i.e. banks, energy, commodities and industrial.",

m978bh,,wallstreetbets,post,1616247522,"Disproving claims published in CNBC using data on WSB discussionYesterday, CNBC and Market Watch published [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/stimulus-checks-unlikely-to-spur-another-gamestop-mania-says-bofa.html) on research concluding that we shouldn't expect people to use stimulus money to buy GameStop stock. One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that “the number of recent conversations \[on Reddit\] including both GME and stimulus is low.”

As some of you know, I’ve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.

I'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below, and [here's a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the ""stimmy effect"" recently.

To start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning ""stimulus"" or ""stimmy"" over time:

[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)

Here is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:

[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)

The drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:

[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)

From both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.

|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|
|:-|:-|
|3/15/21|124|
|3/14/21|103|
|3/16/21|74|
|3/13/21|69|
|1/14/21|67|

To take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.

[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\/ \\""stimmy ratio\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)

I don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.

*As an addendum to my previous post on delta hedging*

Delta hedging, pin risk, gamma, max pain: 

**Dynamic delta hedging** -

Ex: AMC a dealer sold a $14 3/19 call on 3/9 when the stock was at $10. The delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $11, delta goes to 40%, they buy more. Stock goes down to $9, delta goes to 20%, they sell more. 

This week stock was drifting higher and $14 call sellers are buying more stock while $14 put sellers are ALSO buying. When the stock is at $10 the chance of a $14 call being ITM in a week is... 30% let’s say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $14 put being ITM is let’s say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock.
With the stock at $13.50 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example. 

This week a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. Tada! A **gamma squeeze**. 

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn’t hedge fast enough and lost money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options.

“Gamma squeezes” work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of a $14 call being exercised is dropping. 

**Explaining price action Friday afternoons**:

Ok, so we’ve discussed dynamic delta hedging and how dealers are hedging their exposure constantly. They’re not waiting until Friday at 4:00 to find out if they’re on the hook for millions of dollars.

Let’s keep using AMC as an example. Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $14.  Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

Dealers short calls all the way up to $13.50 are almost 100% hedged (they’ve bought almost 100% of their stock). The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let’s say.... $14.50 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) 

Reminder: A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral. As the day goes on the dealers short $13.50 calls are buying more stock to get to 100% hedged and the dealers short $14.50 calls are selling more stock to get to 0% hedged.

*(By Friday afternoon having a lot of open interest in higher $ strikes starts to work against longs. “Charm” is causing the delta on those OTM calls to drop by the minute.)*

The problem for the dealer short the $14 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $13.95 and $14.05  the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It’s the rate of change of the delta. It’s changing a lot!)

**Right around $14 it’s a huge question mark** whether remaining open call and put options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it’s a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn’t know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. If the stock closes at $13.95, calls won’t be exercised, they don’t need to have shares. If the stock closes at $14.05 calls will be exercised, they need to have shares. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $14 and buying every time it goes above $14. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $14 put wants to be long 100% of their exposure at $13.98 and 0% at $14.02. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

So. The reason you’ll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses (remember very few options are actually exercised) 
b) lots and lots of dealer hedging in both directions. 

There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry. Generally if dealers are net short vol you’ll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they’re net long vol you’ll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn’t the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!) A lot of times a big-ish movement right before the close is dealers capitulating and getting squared to be 100% hedged or 0% hedged. Nobody is leaving their desk Friday afternoon potentially long or short millions of extra shares.

**Max pain theory**- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the “maximum pain” to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $10 yesterday so it didn’t totally apply https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/SPY (Don’t get cute and try to trade off this, you’ll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $14 so while not quite “Max pain,” the stock ending the day below $14 did cause “pain” to some remaining call holders. GME Max pain was $150, but there was “pain” for remaining $200 put holders.

*It’s also quite possible that there really was a large natural seller at $14. Again, this is not manipulation.*

**The pin risk “problem”** revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $13.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $14.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $13.95 or $$14.05 or $13.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers “auto-exercise” any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct “DNE”- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours. 

*IE, you own a $14 AMC put. Stock closes at $13.93 on Friday and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $20 a share. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!” 

*You own a $200 GME call. Stock closes at $200.27 and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that GME is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”
More likely a bunch of idiots bought $200 calls and don’t have the cash to take delivery so the options aren’t exercised. 

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. So dealers do have some incentive to push the price to where options won’t be exercised so they aren’t taking some weekend risk. The dollars here are small though... it’s not, “if it closes above $200 I’m screwed and have to buy millions of dollars of stock,” it’s “if it closes above $200 there’s still some uncertainty on whether I’ll be assigned on some calls that are still open so I’m taking some weekend risk.” **MOST of the options have already been closed out before 4 PM. Most options buyers do not exercise.**

On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers. 

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it’s really very small. And then it’s a new week and we’re off to the races again :)

THIS IS NOT A GME REPLACEMENT, I don't want people to take out GME cash for this play (unless it's being used to fuel the rocket directly)

I've been using Annaly Capital (NLY)as a  hedge against the slight tech fall on Thursday, but here's the weird thing- Annaly goes up when SPY goes down (BUT) when SPY was going up its been shooting up a fuckton, this stock has an insanely low volume which leads to even the smallest of buys being able to shift the price up or down a significant amount. 

(be careful reading this next part since I'm retarted and don't know the technicals) (the retartedness actually applies to most of this not just the next part)

I don’t know the long-term ramifications of NLY, but what I do know is that it hasn't hit its peak and has the potential to at least be moved to twice what it's at right now by seeing its current trajectory and its former high. I also did a little research on the company

It’s a mortgage that pays out dividends to its stock owners (much like the RKT play) except as shown here, it had an insanely good 4th quarter-

A reminder that this isn't my long-play, that would be GME...but I do like this stock too  👀

But every day since the quarter results have been announced it's been increasing in price exponentially, so I have an inkling that by at least EOW (especially with WSB attention) it could be at 9.50,10$.

&#x200B;

0.05 for 9$ call when it's only fucking 8.95 right now, that's where this post has been going, this is a fucking 10bagger if the price shoots up this week with added volatility. For whatever reason, the premiums have not been catching up with the actual price and they've stayed very low for even ITM calls. 

But I get it. You want to play it safe, which is exactly why I think just purchasing the stock itself is a nice modest gain you can get for this week, yeah the stock isn’t going to shoot up to fuckin- 20, 30$ i don’t think. But going up 4-5$ is also insanely good and is better than getting cucked by stocks you think are going to go up 20-30$ only just to get slapped down a couple of bucks. (I’m looking at you UWMC) I wish no ill will to UWMC folk btw, but hot damn do I keep getting bested by that bad boy.

If implied volatility is over 100-200%, there's very little money to be made with calls. Your dumbass wants to start a gamma squeeze? Well it won't fucking happen if you're paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging.

You would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls. The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you're paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.

m9229p,grm4fi2,wallstreetbets,comment,1616265498,"To add: for those with some wrinkles. The reason options are “attractive” to buy is their convexity. You have limited downside and unlimited upside, and before expiration the payoff profile is convex. Higher gamma = higher convexity. The higher the implied volatility of an option, all else equal, the **lower the gamma** is, and the less convex the payoff profile is.

Thus GME (and any other options with >100% ivol) offer a less attractive payoff profile. 
You can think of this in terms of convexity, or the simpler version which is just $$- you pay a lot thus your breakeven are much higher than the strike price. 

Also people are evaluating “breakevens” the wrong way. You should look at breakeven on your option investment (where your pnl is $0) AND breakeven versus just buying stock. This is unusually unattractive for GME haha.

*Example* April 16 $240 calls are about $45 at mid. You could buy these for $4500 and your breakeven is $285. **or** you could buy the stock. $4500 of stock at $200 a share = 22.5 shares. 

April 16th 
•stock $285, options profit = $0, stock profit = $1912.5 (42%)

•Stock $300, options profit = $1500, stock profit = $2250 (+50%)

•Stock $310, options profit = $2500, stock profit = $2475

**So your breakeven on the option is $285 but breakeven vs buying stock is just under $310** 
You can calculate this by 
# shares * (x-share purchase price) = # options * (x - options breakeven) and solving for x
22.5*(x-$200)=100*(x-285)
X=$309.67",

m9jwid,,wallstreetbets,post,1616285833,"$RKT: A Bull thesis on Short/Long-term value 🚀Hello Apes,

I am laying out the case on why $RKT - Rocket Mortgage - deserves a deeper look, and the value it has.  We have all seen the amazing DD's floating around, talking about how amazing the company is. Now let's talk about some of the catalyst that will propel Rocket to a higher valuation and amazing company. (Spoiler: No short squeeze discussion here, there are other DD's floating around for that).

&#x200B;

Several risk factors and plays affecting RKT price NOW:

* General market was in a downward trend - FED meeting
* Rates got spooked and ticked up
* Raw Material Shortage
* Lack of housing supply in prior months

Now lets look at some of the catalysts that will work in RKT's favor in the coming months:

* **Spring Housing Boom**. It is known that spring and pre-summer are the most active in real-estate, and this year is no different. We should expect an uptick in movement/sales/refi/building.
* **Biden Administration $15k first time home buyer tax credit & DACA eligibility**. This administration is kicking housing into full gear the next couple of months by offering MAJOR incentives for first time homebuyers. They are also making the 700k DACA recipients elidable for federally insured mortgages (guess where younger folks shop for stuff? Online)
* **Housing data comes out this week**. The outlook looks positive so far (I will go over this thesis in a bit) with the release of housing data, we will get a peer into the real estate market and trend. Overall, the market is still very hot, with huge demand spikes. This will only carry over into the spring housing market boom, and will incentivize more owners to capitalize on this selling opportunity and for builders to kick things into high gear. Overall the trends look good, and in favor of RKT.
* **The new inventory spike**. With homes selling quick, and bidding wars happening, supply will soon catch up to this demand and we should see an up-tick in home sales. Last month, severe winter storms temporarily disrupted some of the supple of homes nationally. As we move into March, we should see more movement.
* **Interest rate uncertainty**. This is a double edge sword. If we think of the inverse, with homeowners knowing that rate increases are imminent, it will incentivize more refi's before. On the flip, what happens when rates go up? RKT adjusts their financials as well. There are many articles analyzing the affect of higher rates, and overall, it seems to have little impact on the short term demands in the coming months.

&#x200B;

Now let's try and break apart the data we have access too, to try and predict how the housing data will look next week. Let's start with the MONTHLY NEW RESIDENTITAL CONSTUCTION, FEBURARY 2021:

&#x200B;

What we can gather from this, is Feb had a down-trend in Permits/Starts/Completions. Let's dig deeper into some of the numbers from the report. When we do, we can see that the New Privately-Owner Housing Units Authorized (Basically new builds coming up), was higher this last month by +28.9% YoY and +3.9% MoM. Ape speak? More supply is on the way!

&#x200B;

The report goes into more detail, I encourage everyone to take a deeper look. *The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.* The outlook on supply catching up to demand is in the numbers, we should see more sales happening over the next couple of months, and see a positive upward trend.

Also a good report to look into is the [Weekly Economic and Housing Market update.](https://www.realtor.com/research/video-weekly-economic-and-housing-market-update-mar-19-2021/) They talk about most of the points referenced here, but one snippet stood out:

>""Despite higher rates, our latest Weekly Housing Trends View shows that prices are rising and homes are still selling faster. More supply is needed, and is expected as we approach spring.""

>—Even if mortgage rates continue to rise, increasing household formation, in conjunction with more favorable market conditions, will keep home-buying demand high, says Chief Economist

&#x200B;

As a final thought, the special dividend payment is going out this week. There is a chance of re-investments back into the stock, and valuations going up. I like the stock. I am holding this for the value.

As always, do you own due diligence before buying into any stock. Don't listen to me, I'm just an ape with a keyboard and some crayons.

m9jwid,grnn3ve,wallstreetbets,comment,1616291005,"If you're short it's a turd. Nothing wrong with RKT, it's just easy to manipulate. I set up a small long term strangle at this level. I'll likely add every month. Most shorts in housing right now are betting on a market crash like 2008. But the problem with that idea isn't the data that supports it, it's the government that is supporting main street mortage holders. They will have to for years to come, but that will be better than a slow 12 year recovery like the last time.

But let's look at the positives that we know, first time homebuyers have been on the sidelines for years and are taking out loans now. Supply is short so builders are working like crazy now making up for demand. The supply side of the market is still projected to be 10 years out, not accounting for new generations. These all create fine jobs. 

RKT is going to be aggressive in changing the industry towards modern tech and timelines. Mac and Mae are still accounting for risk in the market and stopping risky investments on their portfolios from multiple property owners, one of the causes of the 2008 crash was investment property risk. Boomers will be downsizing their properties for the final stages of retirement. Projections say they are 40% of the market. 

While this catching up to the levels of 2008 was crazy fast, a year, no one is looking forward to a repeat. There is massive incentive to keep prices at this level. 

Downsides. Funding of property down payments with portfolios last year was alarming. 
Investment properties in high cost cities got higher HuD funding, double edged sword, this might be speculative for micro bubbles as exodus from the cities from work from home companies is increasing. 
The average price of a home increased at such a level that securing a down payment became out of reach for more and more people. Government has not kept track with this hidden inflation. As such lenders did not assume risk and passed it on to consumers by raising credit score limits. Tightening the noose on the pool of borrowers even further. This in turn canceled out the pool available for first time home buyer grants such as discussed by the $15,000 credit, or even the current $12,000 credit, or getting 2 mortages, 1 @20% for down, 1 for 80%. 

Mortage rates rising. Neutral positon. The market needs to calm down in order for supply to catch up with demand. If boomers decide to dump 50% their properties and retire, great. Those houses will be snapped up at these rates. 

Our biggest problem with the market is simply the majority of houses are old, fucking 70's old on average. Flipping houses is great, but most people don't address anything other than cosmetic fixes. Supply needs to demo and rebuild modern housing in most markets. Like the 50's, 80's, and 00's did. This would offer some realistic benefit to the entire infrastructure, as electrical, energy savings, and mechanical systems could increase value while decreasing usage. The more modular a system, the better for cost. Imagine if HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac were part of the carbon offset buisness as well. And as a home owners you get a cut. 

Our second biggest problem is that wages have not kept up with productivity. If we were to see wages jump 10% and catch up with the 1990's, lol. Wages should always be tied to productivity. Accurate compensation is by far the biggest thing controlling supply and demand in the housing market. If the majority of wage earners could simply build a house with a few years of saving, the market would blow the fuck up. My family has never taken out loans, but has always owned land and houses, why? We build out of pocket. I haven't wanted to build another house for the housing market until this year. Global wages are just as bad.

Third problem. Giant banks need to get out of mortages, and by all data points they seem to be. RKT, UWM, both of them have come to a point in their business that they need to keep the pressure on supply of mortages so demand increases. They need to work on positive government regulation for generation inclusion in the markets for years. They should call Disney

Fourth problem I don't know shit",

I am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like “It might go down below 7.5,” or “Could it head to six or five?” Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company’s market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was… You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed’s reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.

A value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.

The 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).

UWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management’s estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management’s estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.

Employees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.

Management is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.

Yes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket’s massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.

At .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion… This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.

But, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed’s resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM’s dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.

Now, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar’s quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I’ll put supply and demand in banana speak… Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana’s. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply… Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!

To account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.

I will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.

So, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:

· Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity. It is a more general positive catalyst, but it is good for UWMC as well.

· Minimum Wage increase. Whether it be Mitt Romney who wants 10-10.5 and indexed to inflation, or Bernie Sanders 15-dollar minimum wage.

· Jim Cramer’s interview with the CEO of UWMC.

· The Q1 Earnings Call and 8Q. I expect a dividend raise, a share buyback, a special dividend, or a combination of all three.

· HUD’s confirmation of Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary who is focused on racial equity because minorities (Especially latino’s and African American’s) lag far behind white American’s in home ownership. Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the “inventory is much less” than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that “Credit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.” She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of “restructuring,” “access to credit,” and the “down payment” as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.

· Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.

· I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.

· Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.

So, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn’t buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.

At the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC’s and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.

If a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.

This has honestly been such a long write up I’m not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.

I do expect, despite this report I’ve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I’m okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I’ll also tune in to Jim Cramer’s interview with the CEO when it happens.

Thanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis. I have some thoughts on GE, and was compiling a report for that too, but I’ll shelve it in favor of this for now. GE isn’t going anywhere.

&#x200B;

Okay fine TLDR: UWMC is a steal, even with higher interest rates.

Some have made us millions; some have destroyed portfolios. But I just CAN’T resist hammering out this DD. Maybe I was born with bear blood.

I present to you my thesis as to why the market is looking vulnerable to a correction in the next months, and why the new challenger—bonds—presents a significant downside risk.

\--

**Exhibit A: Enormous market inflow of new, paper-handed money**

Last week we saw a record $56.8 billion flow into equities. That amount is staggering, and much of it is no doubt due to the Biden Bucks landing in bank accounts. That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.

**Exhibit B: A new challenger enters the ring: Bonds.**

I can hear you retards whining about it now. “But I don’t give a shit about bonds, why are they even relevant?” Yes, these are your grandparents’ bonds. They also make up a significant portion of 401ks, pensions, and endowments. This is BIG money. These funds go through a quarterly rebalancing where they sell-off what is high and buy what is low. I expect a massive amount of profit-taking in tech and overvalued industrials as those funds seek to lower risk, rebalance, and take advantage of the juicy higher yields.

**Exhibit C: We are again at historic P/E multiples**

Back in the old days, the value of a company was a factor of its earnings and future earnings potential over the next several years. It’s no secret that stocks have completely left regard for fundamentals long ago and are instead priced as speculative instruments. Take TSLA for example. To make its valuation make sense they would need to have a 100% market share. Maybe they will be selling forty-thousand-dollar cars to millions of kids in Africa next year, and I just missed that at the shareholder meeting.

Current P/E rates on the S&P are touching 40 on average. In 2000 we briefly touched 44.

**Exhibit D: The bond market likes to get cute and crash stock markets.**

Many crashes have been proceeded by a rapid rise in bond yields. Now, I hear what you’re saying, JPOW announced the FED won’t let them get too rowdy. I absolutely do believe that, and I don’t think we are going to see another black Monday when an overvalued equities market was met with a sudden spike in bond yields. Again in 2018, we saw another decent correction driven by an increase in bond yields.

Now, I’m not fighting the FED on this one. I do however think we are overripe for a juicy correction, and this is the perfect catalyst to set it off. As we get into 2-2.5% yields on the 10-year-note, quite possibly in the next month or so, we are going to see some money moving. There’s just no way around that, and we already see it happening with the high-flying tech and the QQQs. A lot of that money found shelter in value stocks, which are now rising parabolically like growth stocks. You can see where I’m going here.

**My play:**

As I’ve been burned trying to time these things in the past, I’m loaded up on longer-dated puts on SPY and QQQ. If we see a parabolic spike in SPY this week (as we did with ALL the corrections on the run-up this past year) I’ll look to be adding to these positions. Also keeping plenty of dry powder for buying opportunities when the correction ensues.

Positions:

QQQ 5/21 270P

SPY 5/21 380P","['TSLA', 'SPGI']"
m9f8zz,grn83ht,wallstreetbets,comment,1616282803,"Agree with your comment that it is awesome having an actual discussion around here again.  I think you're generally correct but still early.  The bond market is going to have tantrums in fits and spurts (my opinion) but the inflows are still coming into equities.  While everyone is a bit nervous on valuations, I also think that most companies used the last few quarters to kitchen-sink everything.  

This quarter's earnings are going to be lapping the original coronavirus shut down.  What I expect to happen when earnings start in 3-4 weeks is that a lot of companies guide up (the banks will recapture last year's loan loss reserves as earnings as an example) and companies like KO and restaurants that haven't provided guidance will start to talk about forward visibility with travel/live entertainment opening back up fully.

In addition, don't forget all the stimulus that never got spent.  Not all of it went into GME or loss porn.  American consumers have their strongest balance sheet's ever, and their pent up demand to get out and spend is outrageous.  

I actually think we have another melt up mid-April/early May.  Then... SELL IN MAY, WALK AWAY.

m9r7lj,,wallstreetbets,post,1616312297,"Oil DD *Ape Noises*Let me explain.

When COVID smacked the world in the teeth OPEC decided to cut oil production by around 10%. Otherwise all the OPEC countries would literally go bust.

2019 oil production was \~101 million barrels per day.

To-date OPEC has still has a 7.5 million barrel cut on oil. Becuase they want to see REAL demand and REAL growth from economies before they increase supply again.

**Let’s do some intense math: 101-7.5 = 93.5 million barrels per day of current production.**

**Hmmmm**

What is current consumption?

Look at the pretty circle below. Road uses 35.23% of demand for oil in 2019.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A circle](https://preview.redd.it/fhu1ntn24co61.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbfa930ea6a259fcf77c06149d131387d85a9eb0)

Not sure if you can see this next picture but it’s “August 2020 traffic volume trends” over the years. Obviously during Covid it fell off a cliff as you can see by the blue line below falling off a cliff. It dropped by about 10%.

So I equated that roughly to about 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. This pickup in driving has yet to come back. It has not yet reverted to mean. (average).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Traffic volume trends](https://preview.redd.it/gb4i15q54co61.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e8237c90d736a548419586c7334519b8f92dab0)

Airline industry next up. Althought airline industry only uses like 8 million barrels of oil per day (out of total pre-COVID of 101) it is still significant.

Pretty chart below shows number of flights per day (thousands). As you can see, pre-COVID it dropped a lot, and now is still down 40%. Which equates to a 3.2 million barrels per day missing that has yet to revert to mean.

&#x200B;

# Let’s summarise:

1. Road 35% (Still needs to revert to mean)
2. Electricity 20% (Stable decline in consumption yearly)
3. Petrochemicals 13.7% (Stable growth in consumption to offset electricty decline)
4. Non-road 11.47% (Don’t know)
5. Other-sectors 20.6% (partly airline consumption of 8 million barrels per day before crash)

**Current consumption (according to my envelope calculations) =93.62 million barrels**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# So consumption currently ~ production.

We have OPEC who recently got fucked from COVID now waiting for economies to recover. THEN they will increase supply. Imagine you’re business got reckted, obviously you’re gonna wanna make back your money before your reduce prices).

# My conclusion?

I think oil is going to hover here 60-70$ Until demand from airlines and roads pickup. THEN OPEC will increase supply, but I don’t think they will increase supply before.",

ma1gq0,,wallstreetbets,post,1616347587,"DD 4 SQOn 4 March, 2021, narrow-moat Square announced that it will buy a majority stake in music platform Tidal for $297 million
in cash and stock. As part of the deal, Tidal board member and shareholder Jay-Z is expected to join
Square’s board. Much of Cash App’s recent success has come from Square’s efforts to build
out ancillary services on the platform, and this could provide another tie-in. However, in this case, the
strategic connection seems fairly weak, and Tidal is expected to continue to operate independently.
Square's comments on the deal suggest that the acquisition will provide a further entry point to serve
the music industry, so there could be some opportunities on the acquiring side as well. Still, the deal is
much too small to have a material impact on the $78 fair value estimate by experts.

🚀

Square’s business model, characterized by efficient client onboarding, innovative point-of-sale
devices, flat fees, and an internally developed and integrated set of software solutions, allows the
company to reach and retain micro merchants that are unviable for other acquirers. Square's success has largely come from expanding the acquiring market, as opposed to stealing
material share from existing players.
To develop sufficient scale, Square must move past its micro merchant base, and recent results suggest
it is doing just that. At this point, a bit more than half of its payment volume comes from merchants
generating over $125,000 in annual gross payment volume.

🚀

Additionally, the company is making significant progress in cross-selling ancillary services, such as
Instant Deposit and Square Capital, into its merchant client base. Tthe move upstream and
cross-selling will allow Square to materially improve margins in the years ahead and show the viability
of its business model. Square is a narrow-moat niche operator, not a disrupter, with market
share limited by its relatively high pricing and long-term margins constrained by its relative lack of scale.
The company's effort to build out a consumer business surrounding its Cash App creates some option
value. However, Square is competing in a space with winner-take-all dynamics, and its competitors
have large consumer customer bases. That said, Cash App's relative performance has been strong,
suggesting it is positioning itself to be a survivor.

🚀

Tldr;;

The ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created, and will continue to create, room for
acquirers to see strong growth without stealing share from each other. Ancillary services are becoming a more critical engine for growth and will help Square fully monetize its
merchant client base and improve margins. Electronic payment growth is shifting overseas, and Square’s business model looks portable into
international markets, as the company does not rely on a large local salesforce to attract merchants.

m9i5q6,,wallstreetbets,post,1616280292,"DD and Analysis on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry. (As it expands to Australia, it is trying to enter the pets market and distribute pet supplies and accessories like Chewy)

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. Sellers are starting to prefer the site as they do not have to deal with estimating shipping price. There is only USPS priority. This allows the item to reach the buyer much faster and saves the time of the seller. Items over $500 are sent to Poshmark to ship to the buyer. This is to verify authenticity. This reduces/eliminates any scams that sellers or buyers have to go through for fake item claims. Trust is essential. Convenience is key. 

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued. I like the stock.

EDITED TO REMOVE POSITIONS🛑

**A BRIEF LOOK BACK**

So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. 

He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.

AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. 

Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.

All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.

ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.

**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**

Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. 

AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.

Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!

Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:

1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.

2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) 

3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)

4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.

5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. 

6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.

7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we've seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn't Stopped. 🚀

8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. 


We're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.

I'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.

To the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. 

To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are.

Just buy shares for the same amount of money and hold. There’s a realistic return on investment with it and no one but you will make money from it.

m8xqak,,wallstreetbets,post,1616208158,"GameStop.comOk so here’s some real fucking numbers for everyone. Hey Citadel/Melvin how you like these fucking Apples.

GameStop.com
4.15 million visitors/month over the past 6. 

That’s before all the mess they created and all the PR. I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there’s no such thing as BAD press. 
(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) 

I ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you’re sooooooooo fucked!!!!!

If you use normal website sale conversations it’s usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you’re looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven’t figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let’s say that visitor rate increases 3x that’s 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can’t you? You(Melvin/Citadel) have created a fully functional lifestyle gaming brand that HASN’T even started yet and you’re shorting has given it a share price of $200. As investors we thank you so much for believing in our fledging company and what it has to offer the gaming community. Hahahaha man would I love to be on the GameStop board even just apart of the marketing team. You’re so fucked it’s not even funny. This is a marketing/comms team slam fucking dunk and it’s not even started. The shorters better get their shit together because imma go so fucking long on this investment I ain’t never letting go. I don’t even really want a squeeze I just want a $1,000 share price just by fundamentals so we can all shove it down your fucking boomer throats. God damn I can’t wait to watch Cramer suck RC’s dick live on air. That will taste so good. Imma lick the tears off Melvin’s and Citadel’s cheeks.",

m9fw78,,wallstreetbets,post,1616273399,"Selling Puts: How to Profit Off Stupidly High Premiums with Put Call ParitySo everyone is trying to teach you about how the market makers are scared shitless of selling your dumbass GME calls, so they try to [deter you with stupidly high prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9229p/stop_being_robbed_of_call_premium_for_the_mirage/) to protect themselves against a squeeze.

Some people on this sub suggest buying the stock outright. Well let me learn you some additional market mechanics.

Say you own 100 shares of $GME at $100 and you can sell a $110 call covered call for $10.

Given that price, what's the cheapest a $100 put could be to buy? Well, it better be $10 or greater because otherwise there would be an arbitrage!

Say the put cost only $9, then you could pay for the put with the $10 call, and guarantee yourself $1 per share.

So what does this mean? As call option prices are driven up by MMs, put option prices must rise similarly, and this introduces another opportunity to influence the price of the stock ***by selling puts and collecting a fat premium.***

Say you sell a put. What does the MM need to do to hedge their risk? **They need to buy stock because they are now long a put to offset the negative delta in the put.** What happens as the price moves upwards? MMs will sell that stock at a slow rate since gamma will drop off slowly. What happens if the price moves downwards? MMs will need to buy the stock an accelerating pace since gamma will increase rapidly on the put.

**This strategy will essentially put a floor on the price on the price of GME and you get to collect the premiums being induced by the MMs on the call side.**

It's also a way to lock in a buy at a lower if getting assigned on an option is your thing.

Downsides: you're short convexity on this trade, so don't expect your account to double or triple. Then again, the MMs are trying to prevent run up, so convexity is unreasonably expensive to begin with. Additionally, it's very capital intensive (unless you hedge with long puts instead of cash security).

Aside: Put call parity is actually a far more complicated mechanic with American options due to early exercise, but the point still stands that puts must increase in price along with calls if MMs try to discourage gamma squeezing.

Important Edit: Take a look at puts prices sub $100. Even a $50 put out a few months has stupidly high premiums to eat up.",
m9fw78,grn38s5,wallstreetbets,comment,1616280642,"One thing I think you're overlooking is the number of shares a MM would need to buy to cover the put you're writing is not 1 for 1.

In your example, you use the $100 4/16 put.  As of right now, the delta on that put is -.104.  I was taught delta is an approximation for the probability of finishing ITM.  So the MM would only need to buy 10 shares to hedge against your one put.  But if GME starts dropping, then the MM would ostensibly add shares to their position hedge corresponding to the incremental change in delta.

That, and you'd be required to have $10,000 in unencumbered cash in your account for every $100 put you write.",

m9c17l,,wallstreetbets,post,1616262178,"What's Wrong With This Picture? - Precious Metals DDSo I keep hearing that Silver is ""historically undervalued"" and I wanted to do some DD to see how rare it really is, and what the price should be realistically in comparison to the other metals.

Take a look at the numbers and judge for yourselves.

The big five precious metals are:

PLATINUM

Current Price **$1205/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 350 Million

Uses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry. Current uses are for catalytic converters but as cars switch to EV, will be used for battery cells. Also used in jewelry.

GOLD

Current Price: **$1740/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 10 Billion or a cube 25m on each side.

Uses: TO FUCKING BALL OUT OF CONTROL

PALLADIUM

Current Price: **$2746/Ounce** (up 12% last month)

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 24 Million

Uses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry.

RHODIUM

Current Price: **$29,000/Ounce** (WTF! up 200% YTD)

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 70 million

Uses: Most commonly used as an alloy agent with other metals, Also used in jewelry, electric contacts and catalytic converters. Very hard substance. But apparently can be replaced with platinum (if you use more platinum).

SILVER

Current Price **$26.25/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 49 Billion mined but only 27 billion remain.

In 2020, 978M ounces of Silver were produced globally, and the total demand was 963M ounces. But, only 215M ounces were for investment purposes. The remaining silver was used for commercial purposes (475M and and 96M just for solar), jewelry (187M), photography (30M) and silverware (54M). Crazy to think that many people are still buying real silverware (although I hear a lot is plated).

Almost half of the silver ever mined is now in a landfill. Also, it is not yet economically feasible to scavenge the landfills for salvageable silver based on the price (things aren't that blade runnery yet.)

Uses: The best conductor of electricity, used in all electronics and EVs. Silver is also used as an antibacterial agent. Also used as currency throughout history and as a fast way to move large amounts of wealth. The US Constitution explicitly mentions gold and silver as money.

So....

Why is the price of silver so low?

It occurs in the earth's crust at a ratio of 8 to 1 compared to gold yet it's only worth enough to feed a family of four at McDonalds? People have to literally dig this stuff out of the FUCKING GROUND.

*Something doesn't add up.*

The current price ratio is 65 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold. Throughout history, the ratio has remained closer to 16 to 1 which at this gold price would imply a silver price of $112.

This sounds a little better.

Bank manipulation is well known in this space, and the paper market for silver only functions to suppress the price. If trading was conducted in a responsible manner the silver price would be much higher. Yesterday alone, 280 million ounces were bought and sold. This equates to 28% of the yearly mine production. The big banks control the majority of the metals and have unlimited ammunition to short. This happens late at night, when there is no liquidity to push down the price. But the price has recently started to resist these dumps.

But the tides are turning, someone has been removing physical silver from the COMEX vaults and it is being drained at an alarming rate. This month, 26 million ounces of physical silver has been removed, which is almost four times the normal amount. It has been hypothesized that manufacturers are starting to source their metals from the COMEX directly. Additionally, the Perth Mint has been rumored to have run out of unallocated physical silver bars.

If there is even a tiny inkling of a bank run on silver, the price will shoot higher. And if you look at how undervalued silver is, both historically and when compared to other precious metals, the trade becomes a no brainer.

This is one of the last great trades.  They can't hold the ball under water forever.

I would like to see this turn into a transfer of wealth from the blood sucking banks into the hands of us, the people. Silver will always be the people's money and this may be one of our only hopes to preserve our wealth for future generations.",['BLL']

**Info -** 


Hims & Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims & Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims & Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:


* Skin Care
* Hair Loss and Care
* Sex products (ED, PE, Contraception)
* Covid Tests 
* Supplements
* Primary Care
* Mental Care


**Financials -** 


* Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt
* Gross Margin of  77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)
* 2.6B Market Cap
* Negative (but improving) Cash Flow
* Q4 EPS  of -.07 (Beat by .09)
* Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth
* 2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)
* Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM
* $195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate
* Over 3 Million consultations 
* 91% Recurring Revenue


Simply put, Hims & Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, with the main problems being in the Cash Flow and Earnings per Share. However, both are improving significantly over time.

**Growth -**


Hims & Hers has many avenues to expand in, in every single part of their company. Because of how 91% of revenue is recurring, Hims & Hers is free to take many risks in expanding, as revenue will not be negatively affected as long as the subscription models are sustained. 


[Potential Medical Product Growth](https://imgur.com/a/S3lWXmr)

Hims & Hers' Revenue numbers are also almost only Sexual Health and Hair/Skin Care for now, as their recent additions of Primary and Mental Care have not gotten adoption yet. In Q2 of 2020 92% of Revenue was from Skin and Hair Care, as mainly recurring revenue. Once adoption of Hims & Hers Primary and Mental Care picks up, I can see the company's revenue increasing greatly, and the ecosystem created through Hims & Hers' other products will strengthen this growth.



[2020 Q2 Revenue %](https://imgur.com/a/WtX16oq)



The structure of Hims & Hers also a large reason Hims & Hers has grown so much in only two years, and why the company can continue to grow. Almost every single part of the Hims & Hers experience is proprietary and created in-house, as there were no outside options at the time. However, as these structure growths have already been completed, this means that these next few years are when they will be refined, increasing gross margins, cutting out unnecessary expenses, and allowing the company to escape the bloat of the American Healthcare system caused by individual medicine companies.  
[Hims & Hers structure](https://imgur.com/a/rjw0v0o)


[Sources](https://investors.forhims.com/why-invest/default.aspx)



Although Healthcare is already a Four Trillion Dollar industry, I believe that Hims & Hers has an opportunity to grow the industry as well. Many people across America simply do not receive the healthcare they need, whether due to costs, waiting time, distance, or other reasons, and Hims & Hers solves all of those problems. With appointments being online anyone across America and get diagnosed and receive a prescription within minutes, without needing to live near a hospital, and at a low cost.


**Competitors + Why Hims & Hers?**


I would say that Hims & Hers has a lot of overall competitors, but not for its niche and for many different reasons.
The biggest overall competitor would be $TDOC. As they are both in the Telehealth industry, they will inevitably clash, and of the two $TDOC is much larger. However, Hims & Hers offers direct sales of a large variety of medicine and health care products, which $TDOC does not. Because of this, I believe Hims & Hers will have a larger overall ecosystem in product offered, as well as capture the niche market requiring Skin Care, Hair Loss and Care, and Sex products, which $TDOC does not focus on. I also see Hims & Hers as having a much larger favorability with younger generations, particularly millennials and under, due to a few reasons:


* Branding- $HIMS is heavier on advertising, and their company image is more ""high status"" than $TDOC
* More importance/education on Skin Care, Sex products, and Hair Loss and Care
* Affordability - Hims & Hers has primary care consultations for $39, which is a nice, consistent price especially when compared to the American healthcare system
* Their Twitter account posts memes


Other competitors: Those random Telehealth apps nobody knows about, Amazon (more pricing power on medicine), CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid (Lol)

$BTI is legitimately is 10 - 20x cheaper than all these tech darlings which is understandable, but maintaining this business model is simple. CAPEX is minimal and they maintain complete pricing power. Okay, well all this is obvious, so why should $BTI move up? Enter Altria (**$MO**).

**THESIS:**

* **My main thesis is that the move up in tobacco has already started.** $MO is showing strength for the first time in years. Go search for $MO on twitter and you'll find a bunch of **stick-men (technical analysis)** analysis like this:

https://preview.redd.it/8rmw9ttxd8o61.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50d47e6c81b34313f26742a97777d914d2721e0

I have a piece of the $MO run-up  (not to brag), but am shifting those tendies to the better value, $BTI. I still like $MO a lot and think that the confluence of stick-men, your divvy crew, and overall lack of ""cheap"" stocks are contributing to the run up of tobacco. Now that the runway is clear, other tobacco stocks should follow ($IMBBY,  $PM are comparable if you're looking for other industry plays).

(Side note: the $MO play is straight out of the Michael Burry playbook, and may his soul rest easy after selling both $GME And $MO early. I bet his soul is resting easier after his $C calls are most likely waaaay in the money. if you are a frequent visitor, Michael, please feel free in joining me in $BTI so that you may relieve the pain of selling $MO too early).

Back to your regular programming. When you stack the performance of $MO vs. $BTI when the pandemic started, you get:

https://preview.redd.it/ab0o4l8e78o61.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1041280bb39f87b988c05ec5a91a6359e1b144e

$BTI clearly lagging after trading in tandem for a few months. This divergence has dramatically increased over the past month. Now you may say that $MO deserves to trade higher and that it must be related to performance, right? Nawww, **$BTI has outperformed $MO on a per share fundamental basis the past few years, yet still trades cheaper.** The pure strength of their combustable market is incredible. 

https://preview.redd.it/bv9m37e0e8o61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dc47910d38d8c6d9ecdf827adbb8534730038a

Seems like these should could trade closer in price, no? I have a theory or two in the risk/other section, so go check that out. Anyway, I think **\*both\*** trade higher and lift each other. Tying this all together: **My thesis is that I'm expecting $BTI to follow the $MO move and break out of its choppy zone. You'll then start to see the divvy crew and stickmen start to post about how they're adding for income or that they ""trade the chart and not the stock"".** I'll feel rekt about this if $MO reverses, so if you've gotten to this point and hate the idea, the opposite side of this whole thesis is to buy puts on a $MO reversal.

&#x200B;

**OTHER TAILWINDS:**

* **Fears of inflation?** **(Skip this bullet if you don't like economics)** You're looking at one of the most demand inelastic products on the market. People have bought tobacco and will continue to buy tobacco for years to come. There is no better place to look at this moat than with Australia (where a pack of cigs is 5x more expensive compared to the U.S.). In the past 10 years tobacco prices have doubled, yet demand has decreased by 20-ish percent. They have complete pricing power, or an economists wet dream. I'm not here to FUD you to death about how inflation is going to wreck the economy, but price increases are already here. Go look at any relevant commodity/house price/vapor ware chart and you'll see inflation baked in. $BTI has complete pricing power.

* **Growth exists for vapes**, and seem a bit undervalued after the JUUL disaster a few year ago. BTI is looking to triple their vape segment to $5B by 2025. If this was a pure tech company you could throw on a 50B market cap by that volume/percent growth alone (i know this is not comparable, but I will still keep harping on it)

&#x200B;

* **Ride the cannabis wave.** $BTI recently bought 20% of Canadian cannabis/CBD company Organigram $OGI. Would have loved to see this in 2018/2019 during the true downturn in weeeed, but these acquisitions are positive imo. A low key benefit to acquisitions in the space is that they can strike out a few times without crippling the business. Must be nice to have billions of dollars of free cash flow with small relative CAPEX [https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products)
* **They are literally making a covid/flu vaccine and the irony here is next level.** You can't think of a better way to ~~create more nicotine addicted customers than injecting it straight into their veins~~ change the narrative about tobacco as an ESG plant. I guess there is a real precedent here as they've successfully used this tech for ebola. Anyway, not sure how this plays out in the long-term, but it seems like a net plus. Currently in phase I trials, I imagine successful results headline could give the price a bump. No idea when they'll announce results, but phase I trials started in December. [https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK\_\_9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP](https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP)

&#x200B;

**THE TRADE:**

* **Calls are cheap.** Like 20% IV cheap. $MO moved 20% over the past one to two-ish months and a similar move in $BTI could result in massive gainz, depending on the strike/date. The price on these bad boys are simply too cheap. I currently have been easing into calls with dates and strikes: **4/16 40, 6/18 40 and 45.**

&#x200B;

**RISKS/OTHER:**

I will tell you though, that even though i may lie on the spectrum, I'm not blind. So that you don't obliterate me into being completely biased, I have a few reasons why **$MO** has outperformed and other general comments:

* Respective Index performance: The **U.S. indices have massively outperforming the U.K market** and their stock prices are moving more in line with the index.
* **$MO has investments in beer/liquor from Anheuser Busch.** Some armchair analysts think they should sell that position as they are eligible to sell later this year. 
* **Both have shitty balance sheets** packed with oodles of goodwill from all their acquisitions over the years. $BTI has a worse debt load (Reynolds acquisition) compared to $MO so their capital allocation is less flexible (also why they earn more?). This has allowed $MO to start investing in share buybacks.
* **You're buying cancer in a stick**. I'm completely aware that large institutions and many individuals won't even look at tobacco as it's the polar opposite to any ESG play. **My mega brain** tells me that this is contradictory to many investing in any ESG plays that actually guzzle oil to operate, literally any fast food/sugar company, or most tech stocks that are melting/stealing (privacy crew, wya?) our brains. **My galaxy brain** tells me that investing in humans is the most non-ESG idea possible, so let's countertrade humans by investing in products that kill humans (was that too dark? definitely went a little dark there).
* There is **beef (lawsuits) between $BTI, $PM and $MO**. $BTI is currently suing the two for patent infringement on some of their vapes. I'm not even going to pretend like this is good or bad news for the company given the length of these timelines and unpredictability of outcomes. There is an $HCMC suit that also files against $PM, but any predicted outcome feels like pure speculation. Someone smarter than me can tell you why this case is positive/negative
* **EX-DIV is next week** at $0.75 per share. The price will trade down post recording. This is always a chicken or the egg argument, so I won't bias you in either direction. Bulls will tell you that the stock price will trade up before as investors buy in before to get the dividend, while bears will tell you owners will dump after the dividend is recorded. No opinion here, but something to be aware of.

&#x200B;

**Summary, TL;DR:**

**You're buying a company that offers a highly addictive product with complete pricing power and free cash flow to the moon. The industry outperforms in inflationary or recessionary environments. Investments in alternative products (vapes, CBD, vaccines) are all niceties and should help the business grow, while the cash cow of tobacco remains king.**

**Their main competitor, $MO  (sitting on a 52-week high) has cleared the runway for $BTI to make a similar move as the stick-men and income investors look for yield in an increasingly expensive market. The implied volatility on these calls are cheap (IV at 20).**

**BS pRiCe TaRgEtS: 1 $MO ($50.55) = 1 $BTI (Currently, $39.27). I'll let the stickmen tell you where it can actually pop to, but I believe these are fundamentally the same company on a per share basis.**

**Positions:**

Higher Risk: **4/16 40C, 6/18 45C**

Lower Risk: **6/18 40C**

**12 Reasons to consider an investment in [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/):**

**1.** The Endurance will be the first Pickup EV in the WORLD, with 57 beta models set to come out this month


**2.** Targeted for sale to fleet customers (This is unique compared to other EV offerings)


**3.** Marketing agreement with [Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/), one of the largest privately-owned dealership groups in the United States, established in the 1920s (Henry Ford turns in his grave as I type this)


**4.** Lordstown is the only EV company (aside from Tesla) with a huge state of the art production facility (6.2 million square feet)


**5.** Capabilities to produce an Endurance model every 6 minutes by 2022


**6.** Partnership with Camping World and Good Sam, the largest seller of Recreational Vehicles in the World with over 220 locations nationwide.  Also, see [Marcus Lemonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Lemonis)


**7.** Lordstown is currently working on their second vehicle, an Electric Van set to release in 2022 - The earnings call mentions ""Electric World"" set to debut this year. ([Relevant Tweet](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1338707090903347200?s=20) from CEO of Camping World). EDIT: Also, see [Electric World job listings](https://www.google.com/search?q=electric+world+jobs&oq=electric+world+jobs&aqs=chrome..69i57.5831j0j7&client=ms-android-google&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=tlexp&htiq=electric%20world%20jobs&htitab=&htichips=organization_mid:/m/0c8kps&htischips=organization_mid;/m/0c8kps:Camping%20World) at Camping World.


**8.** Dealer approval for direct sales in the State of California, with [pending approval in Ohio](https://www.manufacturing.net/automotive/news/21283873/lordstown-motors-wants-ohio-to-ok-direct-sales)


**9.** Participation in upcoming [Baja Race](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/)


**10.** On track to begin production in September 2021


**11.** Will use LG chem batteries (Same batteries in Tesla's Model 3 and Y)


**12.** Previous mentions of a battery pack in development for travel trailers that will eliminate the need for standalone generators - ([GREAT reference article](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup))

&#x200B;

You would be blind to not see real potential here, with a target to sell to fleet customers, Lordstown Motors will have many future catalysts, and the best part is that it's an American company.

Now, Imagine how foolish you would feel to ignore the current dip.

The stock price was **$13.30** at market close on 3/19/21 and was just above **$30** on 2/11/21

**My Assessment/Prediction:**

This stock will launch directly to the moon and settle. - The purpose of the current baseless short attack is to push the stock price down so large investment firms can get in while it's low (maximum gains). Then they too will go to the moon with us.

# #RIDEORDIE

**TLDR:** RIDE is going to the moon and bears are actually bulls playing a different angle on their investment.

m9d6ls,grnflxb,wallstreetbets,comment,1616286754,"The amount of negative sentiment, its persistence, feels manufactured with intention.

Look, this company basically is a binary success-failure. You can go off opinion as Hindenburg used to justify most of their opinionated reported, or you can go off of facts and hope the dots contact to wealth.

What are the facts?

1) They have an agreement with Camping World for service station support and to build them an RV. Marcus Lemonis isn’t an idiot. In fact, I’d wager he’s smarter than most of us. I’m sure he’s done his due diligence. More than anyone of us. Easy money follows smart money.

2) The RV design will be used for an EV Van. Work truck and work van. Great accessible markets.

3) Betas are in production now. All you have to do is wait for the proof by the end of this month. Take your chance and wait, or buy in now and enjoy the catalyst.

4) They already secured a dealers license for the state of California. They will sell direct to consumer.

5) They are using proven battery tech from LG Chem. I don’t think LG Chem is a bunch of morons who put money into a sinking ship. A contract has to be made and money has to be guaranteed.

6) GM is on the board of $RIDE. Yes, they struck out with Nikola, but everyone seems to have forgotten how fast they ditched Nikola when the report came out. GM hasn’t budged. Easy money follows smart money.

6B) GM is a partner and investor in $RIDE. They were since day 1 when they handed them a present for a factory. Let’s not forget of the possible buyout once $RIDE gets all of its free money for government loans and grants.

7) They have officially entered into a race. Why would $RIDE set themselves up for disaster on a public stage if they are unsure of their product? Or if one didn’t exist?

8) People keep complaining about a lack of product. Shut the fuck up. It’s a pre revenue company, you dip shits. Product = revenue.

9) The brilliant analyst at MS, Adam “what the fuck is a hub motor” Jonas thought the hub motors were part of the wheel assembly and thought each truck needed 5 motors. They don’t. The hub motors are (gasp) part of the axle.

9B) The Endurance can run on a single hub motor. Consider the equivalent of losing one cylinder in an ICE vehicle. Endurance > ICE. Advantage for fleets.

10) $RIDE has employees. 500 employees and 200 contractors. A fraud company doesn’t hire employees to twist on their on thumbs. Notice how “former employees” were used in the Hindenburg report. Why not ask real employees? No names were given. Why not get actual eye witness accounts?

11) two government cash infusions are pending. One from the US and one from Ohio. The Ohio Secretary of State recently visited Lordstown Motors l. 2 + 2 folks.

12) the sheer conviction behind the negativity should be equally met with the sheer conviction of an investment. If you’re so sure that $RIDE is a fraud, put your money where your mouth is and go short. Buy puts or short the stock. Do it and post.

Positions: 4,100 shares. Anyone who wants confirmation I’ll send them a DM. I’ll want the same from you, especially if your short.

All those reasons you listed already have had me shocked this stock is so under speculated on, are people really buying into the Hindenburg unsubstantiated claims that much? I mean, they have an entire factory already with no cost to build it like every other EV start up, that alone is enough for me.

I'm an autist who loves technical analysis, and the 1 day interval on the MACD is just itching to blow up right now.

Book value: company has $1b in cash and no debts. Its fair value is $5/share. It cannot go lower than this unless the company were to burn all the cash and create no marketable product.

Forward looking: Production is not for another year. The stock market is as psychological as fundamental. DeepFuckingValue primarily invested in GameStop before the new console was released because he knew investors would become excited towards the release date. It's a similar concept here. As production nears, investor sentiment will only increase.

Bears will say the EV bubble has already materialized for FSR. It hasn't. Here's why: TSLA trades 6.5x projected 2025 revenues, NIO about 3.25x. **FSR is currently trading <.5x projected 2025 revenues.**

So what is a ""fair"" multiple for FSR? I do not think Tesla or even Fisker's multiple is fair at all. Tesla has Elon Musk as a CEO's premium that Fisker will never reach because its CEO is known as a failed automotive CEO that has already bankrupted a company. It is also a battery company, along with NIO, something Fisker is not. That is outsourced to Magna. So those multipliers are unlikely. But a 1.25 multiplier is very reasonable. That is a $58 price target and 16b valuation.

Management cares. Fisker has already bankrupted a company before and he will certainly not want to again, pretty much it's all or nothing here. His life is on the line right now. He, his wife, the CFO, and others have shown this by all taking minimum wage job salary cuts in order to maximize shareholder value. The company has also utilized cashless warrants to minimize dilution (and shows they are confident in their cash balance to reach production)

Obvious risks: partner Magna cancels the company is probably cut in half valuation, reservations could miss, funding could miss, things get delayed.

It's worth a bet. I trust Fisker to make it right here. And if he is right, investors will be very well compensated. Thank you. You may shitpost below.","['TSLA', 'TGT']"

m9drpf,,wallstreetbets,post,1616267077,"The AMC Stock vote will be a resounding YES on the part of the Majority, and how it affects you. Read more inside.So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.

The majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.

Of course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.

Welcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.

Here comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.

The stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.

This is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.

Edit:

Everyone should remember that a LONG position on this stock may be the best position to take on this. It's not that the stock is doomed, but the MOASS is probably doomed for sure.

AMC saw what happened to GME. They are not in a position to accept becoming the next volatility stock. They're literally opening their doors this weekend. They are not in a position to become a meme when they are about to stabilize their business for the first time after a complete year of lockdowns and shutdown businesses.

Thanks for the Silver. This was my DD. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk: Note. None of this is financial advice. Almost all of us, including me are literally cats.  


Edit 2 :  


So lets talk volume. This is what becomes the most important. I THINK this is what most people fail to grasp. You own 5000 shares out of 1 million, but 10 million come up tomorrow. You are now swimming in a much larger sea. Previously, you were, perhaps a middling to un-fuck-withable predator. Now the sea or lake as you would prefer has gotten much bigger. MUCH MUCH bigger. You are now much much smaller. In order to maintain your size, you must consume a lot more shares and, even though they come cheap, it will cost you that much more money to get back to your previous position. Now you need to own 500k shares JUST to be back to where you started. Growing bigger got much more expensive, and it gets more expensive as the company continues to do well.

m8rx62,,wallstreetbets,post,1616190276,"Why closing at $14 and $200 DOES NOT MATTER- let’s do this again**why closing at $14 and $200  DOES NOT MATTER** Facts not FUD

I see a lot of confusion about this. (It also wouldn’t have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) 

**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That’s NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner

This is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you’re watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. 

On to the options component of our class - 

Obviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I’m going to try a practical approach.

Use the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went “oh well looks like I’m short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.”

OF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That’s the “gamma squeeze.”

As people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!

There’s all sorts of slightly technical reasons there’s small overhangs at 4:00 but it’s mostly done. 

Second practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear “if the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.” And it doesn’t. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren’t the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don’t you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?

Options markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what’s happening in stocks (Ie last week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There’s slightly more to it (you can look up “pin risk” and “Max pain” if you’re interested I’m trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers.",['PM']

m93mec,,wallstreetbets,post,1616232745,"UWMC not added to Russel Indices...What now? Why you shouldn’t panic sell. A value play and long term hold: Part 2So, the news broke yesterday that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 or 3000. This justifiably has some investors upset and ready to sell. I’m going to make a case for holding, or even adding more. 

I previously made a DD that was fairly popular where I called UWMC a swing play, a value play, and a long term hold rolled into one. Well, the swing play already happened with the run to $12. There was another run to $10 recently as well. We could have seen a bigger swing with index inclusion, but that’s not happening now. I banked $4,000 on those swings, so I can’t complain too much there. However, I understand that some people bought in the run-up with higher prices in mind. There were some posts on here with stupid price targets and “short squeeze” hype. I called these posts out as I saw them. I never thought UWM was wise to jump into for a squeeze alone, even with high short interest, and some here definitely FOMOd into some really bad DD. In fact, I think the guy who kept hyping a squeeze deleted his account. 

But the truth is that many bought at the $10+ mark and now feel lost. Well, this post is for you. 

First of all, I agree that not being included in the indices is bad news. I thought this would be a good catalyst myself. However, I also believe that there is an overreaction here. UWMC may very well have ticked up a couple of percentage points on Russell inclusions, but I think that for the long term, this doesn’t change too much. 

This is why, even without Russell inclusion, UWMC may be a worthy part of your portfolio:


- Price targets and analyst ratings for UWMC:

4 buys, 1 hold.

Low: 10.50
Average: 11.70
High: 13.50

This represents a 19-53% upside from current share price. 

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/research-ratings

- This company is trading at value multiples, with a P/E in the 6-7 range and 1.83b revenue in the most recent quarter. More quarters with minuscule interest rates are on the horizon, and I would be shocked if UWM doesn’t put up monster numbers. I think they will likely upgrade their dividend and make a run up over the course of the year. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook. The fed reiterated that rates are going nowhere.

- There was recently an insider buy of 60,000 shares at around $8. This was more than a double down on his previous 50,000 shares. If he’s that bullish at $8, then I would say anything below $8.50 is a great buy. Even at the current $8.80 price, we are only 10% above the insider purchase. 

- Even if there is no dividend upgrade, the current dividend is 40 cents a year, which comes out to 4.5% of the current price. This is a very solid dividend for an income play. 

- Earnings will likely be in early May. With no index inclusion, I would say late April would be the next catalyst to watch for a run up. If you really want to sell, I would advise waiting until that time rather than taking a big loss Monday. 

- As a result of the recent spat with RKT, UWMC has enlisted a minimum of 65% and likely in the end around 75-80% of independent brokers who previously worked with UWMC and RKT to sign an addendum that restricts them from working with RKT. Considering the wholesale channel is expected to increase its share of the market until 2025, this gives UWMC a giant advantage in capturing more market share. (I’m bullish on RKT too for different reasons, but UWMC is the king of brokers in the mortgage industry and will win the broker battle IMO)

- EPS is expected to INCREASE in 2021 per analyst estimates. This is opposed to competitors that are expected to have a slower 2021. And when interest rates do increase, UWM expects to become an even more powerful influence in the industry due to their reliance on purchase business rather than refinance. 

- UWM is investing in technology by the billions, and they already have far and away the fastest closing times in the industry. They hold what one might call a “moat.” That’s how you grow a company. 

Some bear points:

- The RKT ultimatum could lead to litigation and bad press. I don’t think anything will come of it, but bad press could bring the share price down. 

- The market could collapse/the housing market could cool off. I’d say that if you’re in the industry, you know that the housing market isn’t cooling off any time soon. However, I won’t claim to be all-knowing, so perhaps this could happen.

- Interest rates could rise substantially, and much sooner than expected. Highly unlikely, but possible. 

- Maybe the RKT ultimatum pushes business away from UWM, and they lose out to RKT. I’d say this is the biggest risk right now to be honest, but I do believe UWM will come out on top based on my experience in the industry and based off of what is being reported. I have also heard some personal stories about the situation. However, if UWM starts to lose more market share, that changes everything. 

- The stock market simply undervalues mortgage companies right now, and one could argue that this may never change. I would say that we are already seeing it change with RKT and UWM, and that it will gradually change as these companies continue to put up huge numbers. 


Let me reiterate: UWMC was never a GME type play. It was a good swing play, and now it is a great value and long term play. I would spend some time thinking about whether that matches your investing goals, and if not, get out on Monday or hold until the earnings run-up.

I am personally going to be buying the dip if it comes on Monday. Considering the current share price provides 20% upside to the LOWEST analyst estimates, I am excited to buy the dip to be honest. 

This post is not for my own benefit. My average is pretty good and I am prepared to average down. I just know that some of the people here really got screwed by some bad DD, and wanted to provide my own outlook on why you may be fine. My current position is 1250 @ 8.47.",

Index or no index, the stock is still undervalued by all metrics. The only problem in my opinion is that CEO is holding too much stake in the company. He wants to get rich of index buying, but they are not stupid. Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public. There are many great companies like IKEA and Lego that are private because the families that own them did not want to sell their shares.

Brace yourself for bagholding. If you ask me, you should be selling options on this confusing stock. Don't get fooled into buying options. This one is not a stock for the beginners. You need to play intelligently. You need to play the strategies that pay you, not the other way around.

Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason, and it's not all *Brownian Motion* you stochastic cucks.

So we got two big fucking triangles up here, but do you even know *why*? Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday, dipshits? Okay... let me tell you a story.

It's 2002. Young high-flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck-you money wasn't enough for him. So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a **Market Maker**. This was the start of **Shitadel Securities**, the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet.

Almost immediately following its conception, Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket. Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time. And boy does Shitadel, **an options MM nonetheless,** have an appetite for risk. Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.

Devastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF. It's with a heavy heart that I tell you, **even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF**.

This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest **internalizer** in finance. ""Oh for fucks sakes, what the hell is an *internalizer* now?""

[At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zi54ada2jyn61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d47e4619234795a25b30a30a9c9a5af96167c)

In PFOF, your order is sent from whatever **discount brokerage** you're using to Shitadel Securities, who decides to either: A) pass your order onto the open market, where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B) to take the other side of your order (short whatever you long, or long whatever you short) **at which point the life of your order ends, never making it to the open market**.

You heard me right. **When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood, your order may never land on the open market.** But this is fine right?... Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.

*Okay, but in order for Shitadel to do this, they would need to be a monopoly, right?*

[From https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/](https://preview.redd.it/e9dxgz1npyn61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=27801bbcd469eda01dc0e172a6bccb9de6c2e96b)

*Okay, but if Shitadel were to do this, their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment, even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange, and drive the price up before Shitadel, right?*

[An obvious short attack. https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/gamestop-stock-price-trading-halts-volatility-spike-176-trading-range-2021-3-1030170445 ](https://preview.redd.it/ftjhzgexoyn61.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=1883bbf2e32492ca9614c4ec57b3a19fe1ad705b)

*Okay, okay. But why would Shitadel do this? Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of* ***Impact Cost?***

Remember how Shitadel Securities is an **options** MM? Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags? Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays? It's my opinion that **Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.** A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this. If the price jumps out of their control, not only do they lose money on all their shorts, they also lose money on all their options. If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS.

# Boom.

&#x200B;

\----- P.S. -----

Want to know what the stochastic cucks call this? **Max Pain Theory.**

Want to know my opinion on how to trades options on this? Buy leaps on Fridays like these, and ~~sell~~ not buy weeklies during bull flags like this.

&#x200B;

Tldr; Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.  If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS. 🚀🚀🚀s on  🚀🚀🚀s on  🚀🚀🚀s.

RH's model was to appeal to people with no fee trading but they also said more than half their revenue came from point of order sales to the big guys - meaning the big guys are getting rich and getting better delivery (faster / cheaper) than you because your orders are small but free.

It's a total farce and the senators that don't acknowledge that the system will always be exploited by these greedy assholes are bordering on complacent.

Let's just hope the SEC actually does their fucking job.

These hearings we're super beneficial and educational about how fucking rigged everything is.

m8rzst,,wallstreetbets,post,1616190458,"Long vs Short (GME Calls vs Puts) We just won the week!!!**Let me explain the ""WIN""**

***Guys in the game of Long HF (wrecking ball) vs Short HF (the brick wall) we're like Miley Cyrus... Swinging naked on the ball and along for the ride!***

The Longs are smart, they knew they wanted to play this sideways all week.  They know the Shorts are playing both sides of this game.  Shorts are buying all the Calls 250+, just in case they find themselves out of position even more than they already are.  Additionally, the Shorts doubled down and bought thousands of PUTs.  the magic number was 200.  We just put a clinic on them, the LONGs have us holding that support.  We're not selling and the Longs know that.  So, lets look at next week...  once these AMC peeps realize we've been the endgame all along they'll come back.  They chased 15 bucks and got burned.  With GME earnings report coming out Tuesday and ETFs adjusting next week. Apes will find direction and community support will follow.  We won guys, we won big.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: If you own the stock, you're winning.  If you need more ""dry powder"" to buy more GME. Go to Costco and refund anything you ever bought there.  They'll give you cash and boom... You can keep this fire burning!

Lastly, Stop getting nervous paper hands.  We're not dropping to 140 bucks any time soon... Ride these waves and enjoy the ride.

Not financial advice, I just like the stock!",['BLL']

It’s where your K/D ratio and your ability to entertain an audience influences your exposure on the site and not your cup size. 

It’s dwindling retail locations become hubs for tournaments and places where top players can meet and hang out with fans. It still has a retail component but focuses more on the experience for the community. It has a repair service for consoles and computers and has expended its inventory into custom PC’s.
