As shown in Scion Asset Management's 13F filings published today, Michael Burry bought 800,100 put options on TSLA, making up nearly 40% of his portfolio.

Before his twitter account was deleted, he was very vocal about how he believed that Tesla was overvalued and his filings show that he has very high conviction that TSLA is to further drop.

Some of his other new positions include:

* 171 million dollar's worth of $TLT puts (20 year treasury bond ETF) 
* 165 million dollar's worth of $GOOG calls
* 161 million dollar's worth of $FB calls
* 55 million dollar's worth of $TBT calls ( 20 year treasury short)

neemc8,,stocks,post,1621253649,"TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete?Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS. 

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise. 

I don't know if i'm just missing something or it's just me, I haven't read much debate/discussion on this when reading about TWLO so just curious on people's thoughts.","['T', 'A', 'FB']"

Edit: I've done extensive work with ""chat based ecommerce"", the overwhelming feed back is that customers like the separation of platforms, ie. Use WhatsApp for personal close friends, Slack for work, SMS for talking to businesses (chat based commerce). 

There's no real need for a combined single chat platform. Tech tried this in the last 10 yrs and it went no where. The culture and need just isn't there.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

nelhgz,,stocks,post,1621270567,"Help Me Understand CME Futures And InflationSo right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). 

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.  

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html). 

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html). 

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand.

Fitch Ratings expects the rally in China’s steel price to slow in coming weeks as summer approaches, as the season tends to see lower downstream demand due to subdued construction activity.

nei7oj,,stocks,post,1621262887,"Help a Novice Improve Embryonic Portfolio?So I recently started investing the last few months and am getting cold feet from modest losses. I plan to invest roughly $1000 more in the next few months.

I got a few shares of AAPL (I’m a total fanboy) at 135 and quickly learned I should have DCA’d. I started to diversify, adding in small $10-20 portions of GOOG, AMZN and FB here or there—whenever I saw a dip ($50 in each so far).

I have 10 shares of FNMA at about $2 (my friend from college was convinced it will moon...)

I dabbled in crypto with about $200 (split between ETH, ADA, MATIC,BTC) but because of my timing the results have so far been *dismal*—so I’m here today!

I’m considering UAL as a reopening play, and want to diversify out of just tech. Maybe into alternative energy/sustainability projects, and perhaps in gene mapping and editing techs but I don’t really know where to start.

Since most of my assets are crashing I want to invest in some safer ETFs. I’m thinking SPDR and NASDAQ, and maybe some tech and green energy ones, and some that will profit from massive gov infrastructure spending. Again I don’t know where to start.  

I’ve seen a lot of mentions that “growth” stocks are bad and “value” stocks are good because of worries about inflation. But I have no idea what the difference is. Is now even a smart time to invest? I feel like I should have done this a year ago... :(

I’m in this for the long haul, but I don’t want to invest in something that might be *deep* red the next few years (hence I’m not putting a dime more into crypto; stocks and etfs seem as safe as savings by comparison and that’s what brought me here)

nemqxc,,stocks,post,1621273457,"$BCEI DD -- No Moons or Rockets, Just Classic DD About an Undervalued Energy CompanyIf you are looking for moons and rocketships this is not the due diligence for you. This is the due diligence for those who want to round out their portfolio with an unexciting albeit profitable upstream energy stock that won a huge race for something you likely aren't even aware of: the highly profitable DJ Basin. 

BCEI's current price is 41.90, and its forecasted range is 47.00 to 66.00. [Forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BCEI), and more [forecasts](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcei/analyst-research).

Importantly, they have recently participated in a 1-for-1 with another company and I believe the market simply hasn't internalized their new size.

2021 estimated EBITDA puts them at 3.4x as last Friday's close. This is inexpensive vs the greater U.S. upstream peer group and, importantly, compares to 4.1x standalone BCEI. In other words, if the new company is simply valued in the same ballpark as BCEI alone there's significant upside, and there's nothing about the upcoming merger that should indicate a discount. In fact the opposite is the true, consolidation demands a premium.

A similar conclusion can be reached from a DCF valuation, but given the recent merger I think it's more useful to observe pre-merger 10-year free cash flow is a hair under 1 billion. The target should be 50 regardless of the merger, so depending on how you peg the risks with the merger, well, it's up to you. There is a world where BCEI is like an upstream energy company of this size and trades at 70 with a DCF like all the rest. 

**Who Should Get This Stock?**

If you're looking to get rich fast, the NBA and NHL playoffs are just around the corner and sportsbooks are taking bets 24/7. If you're looking to invest, consult with your financial advisor about BCEI. 

I invested because it is something I can forget about for a few months, and when I come back after the ex-dividend date I accept the five or six percent growth, the three percent dividend, and before I know it I'm up 50% and I want to share some good news about a stock that defines the unsexy, good business practices of upstream energy in Colorado. 

**What's BCEI?**

BCEI is a pure-play rural DJ Basin operator. ""Pure-play"" as in they focus solely on extracting oil and natural gas from Denver's Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin. The tl;dr is BCEI possesses a lot of rural Colorado acreage plus very low operating costs plus significant free cash flow. Combined, it equals it's still undervalued compared to peers in spite of the run up the last few months. 

They will also be the first net zero upstream Colorado company, using offsets to become carbon neutral. Aside from being just good stewards of the environment, they are able to do this because of the fundamentally sound structure of their company. Compared to peers they have less wellheads that make more money. In the DJ Basin, if your wellheads make a lot of money it's because they produce more oil than natural gas. Natural gas is typically put right into the atmosphere and uncaptured. Because their wellheads are more oil than wasted natural gas, they cost less than their peers and they can afford to invest in these fixed wellheads rather than running from spot to spot letting natural gas get fired off into the air. [Source](https://ibb.co/5krgsGP)

**Upside?**

The reason I love BCEI is because consolidation is the name of the game in the DJ, and they have the best chance to be the big fish that eats all the smaller fish. Whatever company is able to gobble up the other fish the fastest is going to make a lot of money, partially because the DJ Basin is already profitable and partially because increased oil prices are going to push margins up.

The reason BCEI is going to win consolidation is because they developed zero debt during the downturn, and they are already swinging their free cashflow and zero debt around in a huge way. 

They are going to combine with a smaller, more debt-heavy, competitor and the combined company, to be named Civitas, will create the largest upstream player in the DJ Basin. It's going to be a 1-for-1 merger. This follows after the outright purchase of Highpoint several months ago. [Picture of acreage](https://ibb.co/yRNSXnR)

The annual dividend of $1.40 recently announced by BCEI will be increased to $1.60 as soon as the deal closes. Notably, of the significant expected free cash flow for the combined company, the dividend, at the new higher level, only represents an annual outlay of just under $100 mm.

**Downside?**

Downside is that they go sideways, maybe lose their luster, and go back to being severely undervalued rather than their current ""normal"" of simply undervalued. This isn't financial advice, good stocks go tits up all the time. Shit happens.

**Conclusion**

What are they going to do with the rest of the cash? In the past they've played it smart buying high quality companies in their market, like HighPoint Resources, and used these synergies to grow YoY. For example last quarter, with quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share, they beat estimates of $0.73-.76 per share. Their forward looking guidance indicates continued success. Chances are there is a special dividend and/or continued consolidation, which is where the upside comes into play.","['T', 'NDAQ', 'A', 'PEG']"

nej11l,,stocks,post,1621264807,"Specialty retail stocks are bumping: PLCE and DDS particularlyRetail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months. The biggest gainers in this space are DDS (Dillards) and PLCE (The Children's Place). Both could be considered boomer stocks that still rely on brick & mortar, especially Dillards. But both company's are carrying strong tailwinds from reopening and pent up demands.

PLCE has Q1 earnings coming up on May 20. PLCE mainly sells children's clothing. And I think analysts and investors are pricing in the next 4 months of growth as COVID is lifting, kids will need new clothing for summer (parties, birthdays, etc) as well as back to school in 4 months. PLCE in Q4 reported that their digital sales are up, but that they're revenues are still down. Macro factors, they're still worried about declining birth rates. Since January, PLCE is up almost 70%, mostly through reliable increasing revenues and earnings. Despite revenue not beating expectations, they're still doing well.

One thing to note with PLCE using their Q4 2020 returns: https://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/26f7ea63-8d41-481a-984d-b53f68e13032

In February 2, 2019 they made $1.9B in sales with profit of $111M.  At that time, their stock was trading at about $100. They're on track to hit that number in 2021 and even surpass it based on analyst estimates. We could see 50% more upside from PLCE if their Q1 results show anywhere near $600M in sales.

DDS is a different story. DDS just announced a $500M share buyback and a $0.15 dividend. This was on Friday. And since then, DDS has jumped almost 40%. It opened Friday at $107 and its currently trading at $142. On Friday, it was trading as low as $100 at one point.

A $500M share buyback will be done at the market:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-announces-stock-buyback-worth-%24500m-to-pay-%240.15-quarterly-dividend-2021-05-17

> Under the new buyback program, the company can acquire securities via open market transactions as well as private negotiations.

The dividend is payable on August for investors as of June 30.

The P/S ratios of the department store industry are between 0.28 and 0.50, with DDS being on the high side. But their revenues are increasing and with a share buyback that will lower their total float, thus decreasing their P/S, DDS could be an exciting story. The funny thing is that DDS options have spiked in IV, so I would probably buy shares to avoid any major losses due to stock dump after June 30's ex-dividend date.

If you're looking non-tech plays to diversify your portfolio, but still have some aggressive gains, PLCE and DDS may be nice additions.


Anecdotally, many states are reducing social distancing restrictions. I could see department stores getting lots of benefits from traditional forms of shopping. I don't think the retail-pocalypse has destroyed the entire industry quite yet.","['T', 'NDAQ', 'A']"

All green energy is getting clobbered by raw material shortages.

The market has absolutely punished them for it, because growth stocks that operate at PE and PS ratios of ENPH has absolutely no room for error otherwise they'll be punished.

I think it'll go back, but you need to wait for it to find its bottom. Q2 earnings may provide more insights whether it'll slide more. 

This isn't a short squeeze or hedge fund attack. This is an aggregate macro factor supply/demand issue.

Ask yourself these 4 questions:

1. What is ENPH's revenue growth rate?

2. What is their PS multiple?

3. How many years in the future is ENPH's growth priced into the current stock?

4. What are competitor multiples?

ENPH was pricing in nearly 4 years of growth into their stock. If you're willing to wait for this chip shortage to end (predicting in about 1-2 years) you could see 100% growth in ENPH price. Thats a good ROI given SPY only grows about 10% a year.

ne3gu2,,stocks,post,1621215495,"Looking for advice regarding overdiversificationI just recently started investing at 23, and I wanted to try to have a diverse portfolio in various growth sectors(mostly tech-related). But now I'm looking for some clarification about whether or not a person can be ""too diversified"". To use myself as an example, I currently have $5000 in stocks, not including money invested in broad market index funds. So with that 5000 I'm in 9 stocks, and I'm curious if it's possible to too diversified in stocks when you have smaller portfolio",['A']
ne3gu2,gye8o0e,stocks,comment,1621216907,"You can get a lot of different answers to this question, but there really isn't a correct or wrong one. 

It's really your comfort level and goals (goals that change over time).

As young as you are I personally wouldn't be afraid to pick just a few that you really believe are going to do well over time (assuming you're long).  For example you mention tech is your thing - there's really no one that could fault you for throwing it all into a few of your favorite FAAMG picks.  But I certainly wouldn't advise throwing it all into a few risky bets... unless you're also ready to accept the losses if it doesn't go well.

Personally, I started out with a portfolio so long I couldn't even keep track of what I owned, now it's down to 5.  That number can vary a bit... but 5 is what I've found works for me.  

As I get closer to retirement that number will likely go up for better diversification, or I may just end up throwing it all into ETFs.","['T', 'A']"

nejvls,,stocks,post,1621266849,"US or Canadian DividendsUS or Canadian dividends as a Canadian?

Hi there I have a dilemma I need help on. I have some money to invest upwards of 50-100k for dividends stocks from recent riskier investments and I’m just wondering what is the better option in terms of yeild with the tax on American dividends being larger. One company is Canadian EIT.un. Great company, 10-11% yeild right now. Pay monthly dividend which I like hate waiting for quarterly. Have been paying same dividend for 20 years. 

Or we have ORC which pays 14-15%. Also pays monthly. Company seems solid and both have a long MR of 30% so I can margin them both the same to get my levered dividends for more gains. 

Now my question is for the math and tax experts. Since this money can’t go into a TFSA as mine is currently maxed out, what is the better play for yeild after the tax mans comes for his fair share? Love the 15% but not if is going to be a hot 8% after. Depending on my investments later on the year I should be making around 55000$ on paper but could possibly make upwards of 80-90 if all goes well.

would that tend to make the price of the stock go up or down in the short term?

ive thought about this all weekend, and i cant decide if it would make the people that hold the stock want to sell it higher than that big buy, or people want to buy it higher, or maybe make people want to buy it lower because if they just wait until that big buy is filled then nobody will be buying the stuff... anyway im still a noob so i appreciate the help :)  


  
edit\*:what i mean specifically, is what will happen to the price (normally); do those big orders get filled? i would think so, for someone to place an order in the millions of bucks, seems like they probably know what they are doing. so i see the big order and think, the price must end up dropping at least to there, if the person expects it to get filled? im just deciding if i should get in at a penny above that buy order or wait until its filled and see if the price goes lower

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

ndw3uz,,stocks,post,1621193991,"Trying to understand the pros and cons of buying on a marginHi, I’m relatively new to investing. I started buying stocks in February and you have really gotten into it and enjoy it immensely. There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest. That makes sense, but again I wonder what their angle is. I really don’t want to get myself in a bad situation because I’m ignorant. Any advice or experience on the matter would be greatly appreciated!","['GOOGL', 'T', 'A']"
ndw3uz,gycyavb,stocks,comment,1621194420,"Pro is that you use leverage and can increase your returns since you can buy more but it’s not all your money.

Con is that if things don’t go the way you think they will, you can get a margin call and either have to deposit more money into the account (which you may or may not be able to do at that time), and if you can’t they can sell some of yourself positions to raise the cash needed.

And just like it can magnify your gains, it can magnify your losses.

Part of the reason RH is offering it to you is because they’ll charge you interest on any portion of the margin that you’re using and can make money from you that way.

For someone who is new to investing (and frankly for the vast majority of retail investors), it’s probably best to stay away from trading on margin.","['T', 'A']"

ndw3uz,gycze85,stocks,comment,1621194913,"When you trade on margin, the margin amount allows you to make larger trades. After the trade is over (you sell), the amount used to trade on margin is returned to the broker. You keep the profits.

Example: You're given 4x margin. You buy $1,000 of a $10 stock with your money, and use $3,000 of the broker's money, totalling $4,000 for the trade. Your stock price goes to $11, and you sell for $4,400. The margin amount of $3,000 goes back to the broker. Your profit for the trade is $400 instead of $100. 

Be warned: this works in reverse if you lose on a trade. Margin accounts let you get more leverage, but you can lose just as much in the negative, and thinking you won't lose is naive. Everyone loses, and the idea is to win 51% of the time.

ndyees,,stocks,post,1621200375,"The cleanest re-open play left - Simon Properties Starting in early fall last year, I kept questioning many of my recovery-related positions as having already had their run. As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).  


The stock offers a nice dividend to top it all off, the only time it diluted is when it made some acquisitions for basically pennies on the dollar at the height of the pandemic (great moves), and run by good management.   They’ve even kept paying the dividend, paying it out every quarter still, with Q1 2020 being the sole exception, when everything was closed.

nduilz,,stocks,post,1621189649,"Thoughts on/experiences with carbon credit ETFs?At the risk of sounding like I'm ""pumping,"" I've had a good experience the last month or two in my portfolio. There are literally only two ways to buy in: KRBN, a mix of credits from different countries stabilized by short term treasuries; and GRN which is a pure play in EU market carbon credit. They're commodities that I've ended up using the way conventional wisdom said one should use bonds 10 years ago.

never see them mentioned in the news (I'm a WSJ/ Bloomberg TV/Businessweek kinda girl.) I'm baffled when they throw Bloomberg terminal graphs of commodities and exclude the Barclay's carbon credit index. The only ""non-tinfoil hat"" explanation I can think of is that they're not a volatile enough commodity to be worth discussing right now.

I can't shake the feeling that there's something I'm missing. Some kind of due diligence I'm failing to do because I don't know where to look...

Is there something other than ""stuff with higher returns is on fire sale"" that has an effect on carbon's performance as a commodity?

nduilz,gydg8nz,stocks,comment,1621202575,"I’m not familiar with carbon credit ETF’s, but do have small experience procuring and trading the underlying credits for resale to customers, as well as financing for carbon offset projects.

I’ll write my thoughts on a bull and bear case:

Bull: As demand for carbon credits rise, prices of said credits will rise. Due to both organic demand growth from companies looking to offset emissions, as well as regulatory pressure in advanced economies, the raw volume of carbon credits traded should increase. Since the “cheap” carbon offset programs have already been implemented, these new projects will be higher cost, requiring the market price of a carbon offset certificate to rise.  This bull case is relatively simple. More demand + no easy way to offset carbon = higher prices.

Bear:
1. Carbon capture technology and other emission offset tech becomes more efficient and carbon credits decrease in value as these credits become cheaper to generate. 

2. Since the definition of what qualifies as a carbon offset is entirely theoretical, there are ample opportunities for fraud and questionable business transactions. Depending on the regulatory body certifying these credits, some projects are certified without proper due diligence. This makes the cost curves of these credits murky at best, and difficult to project future pricing.

3. As you said in your post, carbon credits are mostly created, regulated, and sold in western markets. This is in part due to the only regulators willing and able to sign off on the validity of carbon credits being located in western countries, but also because that is where the only market for the credits exists. In a way, carbon credits are a luxury item, not a need to have. Once the price rises high enough, countries such as Vietnam will begin to invest and sell carbon credits at VERY low prices. Imagine China reforesting an area and selling the associated carbon capture. I’m sure they can do it cheaper than how we are currently operating...

As far as your tinfoil explanation, I personally feel there is such low transaction volume and liquidity that the major news outlets don’t follow carbon credit indexes and pricing. 

I also think that carbon credits are a relatively safe investment for now. I have never seen so much interest in procurement of carbon neutral products and credits before. I think in the next 5-10 years there will be a significant increase in demand where the price of an underlying tonne of CO2 will at least double.  Once that happens I would be ready to jettison out as there may be a rapid fall.","['T', 'A']"

I’m studying sustainable business and one of my professors believes carbon taxes and cap-and-trade are inevitable to become widespread in the US relatively soon. I’m probably going to end up buying into one or both of these. I’d also like to hear from others because again, I’m not really sure what I’m doing and learning as I go. Perhaps 10 years down the road, these won’t be great investments depending on how much carbon we’re still using (this is a very optimistic approximation but it’ll probably take longer than that unless some big changes happen very soon on a global scale). That would be a good consequence though. Maybe they aren’t talked about on major news networks not because of a lack of volatility, but because enough people aren’t on board yet.

ndvsnb,gydcb18,stocks,comment,1621200741,"Sure, here is what I know.

1. In general, buy low and sell when you retire, or get insider knowledge and learn to avoid the SEC. 5% corrections happen four times a year, 5-10% corrections happen about once a year, and 10-20% corrections happen every 18months or so. The entire world will feel like it is falling apart and the end of capitalism is near; so don't sell, just smile and push all your chips in... unless you own small caps and meme stocks, in which case you deserve to panic sell and take your losses.
2. Your initial strategy should be buying sp500 large cap ETFs and whole market ETFs every month, and loading up on dips with your extra cash. This is most people's retirement strategy to be honest. As you get into it more and more, you might buy some calls or puts, or specific stocks you feel strongly about.
3. You will get a feel for how low is low enough once you watch a few dips. Many of the 3-5% corrections are just because the market over reacted and is cooling off, or Yellen said something about inflation. The 10-20% moves are usually coupled to fed rate hikes, over valuation fears, real inflation, or a couple quarters of less than desirable economic data and people start to fear a recession...or a combination of these factors. Most recessions don't get below -35%, so once we get close to these numbers all chips go in. 
4. Small caps usually do best coming out of recessions, so dump into small cap etfs once the selling slows, after six months of so of recovery, shift back to large caps and blue chips. Small caps also do worse during recessions, and worse after recoveries, so don't hold them for long. Look at the green energy bag holders on this sub (ICLN) - that should be enough proof. 
5. Tech grows fast, but is dependent on fed interest rates. If rates go up, tech panic sells off. More dip buying potential for nice rebound plays.
6. Dont fight the fed. Once the fed starts quantitative easing, the market goes up, so be invested. Once the printing stops, overvaluation and inflation fears correct the market, so be ready for a 10-20% move down. ""Be ready"" means move all your extra cash into the account, pick your stocks and ETFs, and be ready for the move up or down. ""Extra cash"" means everything other than money needed for your car payment, rent, and ramen - dump the girlfriend or boyfriend. 
7. ETFs are easiest unless you have intimate knowledge AND like to invest as a hobby. This doesn't mean only buy VOO, you can buy etfs for specific industries, but you will need to pay closer attention to the markets and move cash around as necessary.
8. Dividend stocks suck. Dividends get smaller and smaller as the years go on. Dont do it.
9. By the time you hear about ""it"" on CNBC, FOX, or CNN it is too late, don't jump on the band wagon. 
10. I had something about a rabbit and a turtle, and wise words to encourage mediocrity that somehow amounts to excellence over time, but clearly that is so stupid I forgot. Get as much money into the market as you can on dips when you are young. Full-on 100% everything in. The proof is in a compounding interest calculator, I recommend you play with one. Or look at the share price of MSFT and AAPL at the peak of 08, then the bottom of the recession, compared to now. Every month you set aside as much money as you possible can for investing, no matter what.
11. Only date people who have both a 401k and a roth IRA. Employers often pay for one account so someone might sound financially responsible because ""they have a retirement account"", but they are actually fuck-wits and posers who will expect fancy diners and ruin you financially. If they ever order avocado toast, exit immediately. This goes for friends and family as well as dates. Live frugally.
12. Money does not give you purpose. Money will not help you ""find purpose"". Purpose is something you create through hard work and dedication to something greater than yourself, and when the time comes having money will be really nice. If someone tells you ""what is the point of having money if you don't spend it?"", like the avocado toast scenario, ghost them and run away. These people will suck your account dry ""getting drinks"", or ""going out for coffee"", or ""why not get a nicer apartment, you deserve it""... blah blah blah - POISON! Live frugally. 
13. Start with a ROTH IRA. You can withdraw from this for home purchases, so it doubles as a tax advantaged investment account as well as a way to save for a home. Being a home owner will improve the quality of your mating options too. Once you clear 6k a year in contributions (max out the IRA), open a 401k next and dump everything extra you have into that. Once you max out your roth and the 401k, then get a brokerage account and keep going.
14. Use a real broker like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity. Stay away from the millennial and gen Z crap apps like Robinhood.

Negatives: Their share price took off when pandemic-driven demand called for more hand sanitizer, but that was short-lived as supply outpaced demand ([page 26](https://ir.pacificethanol.com/sec-filings/content/0001213900-21-017995/0001213900-21-017995.pdf)).

Positives: Its Pekin, IL facility sits on top of one of the most significant carbon capture resources in the United States (the [Mount Simon Sandstone formation](https://www.google.com/search?q=mount+simon+sandstone+formation&safe=active&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS904US904&sxsrf=ALeKk00gZvOVbExceFzK2wWSf32S0zqoSQ:1621200440133&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidwd-iks_wAhXlTN8KHQL-DbgQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1536&bih=722)), which is the at the center of the company's talks for a carbon capture and sequestration program. How much of a benefit this will be, as well as the timing of when it comes to fruition remain to be seen, which makes this particular asset intriguing, but highly speculative. Another plus is its most recent earnings posted a quarterly profit, thanks in large part to increasing commodity prices (for source: google the earnings transcript and read the first paragraph of the CFO's remarks). That gives it the potential of being a haven from inflation, should their profitability continue to grow with commodity prices.

The main asset they spun off was their ethanol production facility in Madera, CA. The total value of the deal is $28.3m, and by way of reduced interest expenses and carrying costs, this should result in approx $1.1m benefit per quarter to their overall business performance (ctrl+f for ""Seaboard Energy"" in the most recent earnings transcript). Sale is scheduled to complete this quarter.

I personally believe stocks will keep going up with a few corrections but no big crash. I think the big one will happen within the next 5-10 years due to a financial crisis. As for the housing frenzy, I believe that will burn out in a couple years and drive prices down ~20%.

This alone says ARK is bit of a risk and will focus on companies replacing the status quo. That may take some time. I do believe it will happen though. Take ARKF, for instance, she’s not going to go and invest in a company that prints out paper checks or manufactures atm cards. Square, Shopify, Zillow are a few of the top holdings. Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.

Also, other fintech etfs have suffered the same fate recently. Others may not have fallen so far but that seems to be because they weren’t as successful during the big run up late last year

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE!

Houses have a huge fee to buy or sell (realtor and other fees) plus you can only buy or sell the whole thing,  you can't just sell 10% of the house to get cash to buy a car, it's all or nothing.   Because of that it isn't tax efficient,  you have to sell a lot of stock to buy a house and get taxed on that,  then later selling the house if stocks look better you have to pay taxes on the entire amount of gains there too.  Lastly,  you can sell stocks rather quickly but buying or selling a house takes a least a month.   I don't think you'll see much money moving from stocks to houses as a trade based on houses rapid gains over a short time.","['T', 'A']"

ndmxwe,,stocks,post,1621166794,"The Weekly DD - AT&T (T): A Bond ProxyWhat if I told you there was a stock that offers a \~6-7% dividend AND has potential for revenue growth, is that something you would be interested in? That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently [**increased expectations**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/at-t-raises-hbo-max-target-to-as-many-as-150-million-subscribers#:~:text=AT&T%20Inc.,key%20to%20the%20company) of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

However, the current S&P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can’t justify a 2% yield on S&P considering it’s a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

For stocks, higher cost of raw materials and higher cost of labor for stocks mean higher cost of production, and lower consumer buying power means lower demand and often lower revenues. Since valuation is dependent on earnings, valuations will fall, but there's no real indicator as to when they rise again - probably not until inflation falls, generally. 

For bonds, you have inflation risk and duration risk - the risk that your principle isn't worth as much in real money, and the risk that bonds at higher interest rates are being issued causing your bonds to lose value, respectively.

In that scenario the S&P would gradually adjust. In other words, there may not be a good way to time this generally.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
> # Fed Ahead
> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
> # Retail earnings and housing
> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
> “The S&P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
> “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

> # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

> # ""Inflation"" Trends

> You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

> On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

Capital gains of $1 needs to be reported and tax paid on it. It does not kick in at a certain number, it's any amount of profit. Although there are different tax levels based on how long you held onto it before selling like less than a year or more than a year. 

You could buy a stock for $5 and sell it for $10, you still need to pay capital gains on that $5 profit, even if that's the only trade you have done within the whole year.

ncyqua,,stocks,post,1621084843,"Risks regarding AMD?I wanted to hear your opinion about AMD. I am considering investing a large portion of my portfolio in AMD and have concerns about two specific risks:

If the mining boom slows down because the bubble has burst or something similar, I fear for the demand for graphics cards. I know it's rather partially dedicated mining cards used to mine, but to a large extent GPUs as well. Won't the used market for graphics cards then be flooded with cheap goods and the demand for new graphics cards collapse?

Also, many tech companies are starting to design their own chips, for example Apple, Microsoft and Amazon (the latter for their server business). And you can see from Apple's example that they are also very good at this.

How do you assess the two risks? Or can you think of other reasons not to buy AMD (or other chip designers)?","['AMD', 'AMZN', 'T', 'AAPL', 'A', 'MSFT']"
ncyqua,gy7ppqs,stocks,comment,1621086285,"While there is some risks for AMD with Amazon designing chips for AWS, the number of customers for AMD in the cloud and server space is quite large and so there is substantial diversification there. Large number of cloud providers won’t be able to design their own devices and ARM will never be 100% of the server market unlike the smartphone market. AMD is also well diversified into console gaming and IP licensing areas. See for example Samsung’s device using Vega. 

Regarding mining, I don’t think this is significantly material to AMD from downside risk since a bulk of the GPU business is in actual graphics use. This includes high end PC gaming, console gaming and yes also perhaps mobile gaming if Samsung’s plan comes to fruition. 

So overall risks to AMD are just the usual competitive pressures but given that the overall markets they are playing in continue to increase in size, as long as they execute they should be fine. 

Having worked in the chip industry for 25+ years there is not a whole lot of reasons not to buy into semiconductors. Semiconductor content in our lives continue to increase and while the players might change the overall industry is going to be growing and valuable over time. Just look at TI or STM or even INTC who have been around for 50 years and still going strong.

Just don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. AMD and others for that matter have struggled in the past on execution and so the stock might trade sideways or even down for a long time.

ncyqua,gy82xj9,stocks,comment,1621093002,"Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. 

Intel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. 

Hence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. 

Intel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. 

Also the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. 

As I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. 

Is NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. 

Now regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. 

And regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years.

ncfwmz,,stocks,post,1621018076,"Amazon To Hire 75K Fulfillment Workers With Starting Hourly Pay Of $17, Bonuses Up To $1K'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) will employ 75,000 logistics and fulfillment workers in North America at an average starting wage of $17 an hour.

Most of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.

Amazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.

Amazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.

Amazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

In April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.

Last year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.

Amazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'

nd8qdc,,stocks,post,1621113470,"Discussing the risks associated with stocksOne thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.  I see a lot of posts and comments from people upset about their investment/trading choices not working out, and I think a lot of that comes from a lack of acknowledgement of the risks associated with stocks.  It often times seems as though people interpret 'high risk/high reward' as 'most likely high reward with maybe a small short term downside'.

This post isnt meant endorse a bear or a bull case in general - make your own decisions based on your research.  This post is more to encourage people to try to better understand the downside possibilities of different positions.

For starters, an all stock portfolio, even one where you're only invested in passive tracking funds, has historically been considered pretty high risk.  SPY was around $150 in 2000, and touched the $80s in 2002 and 2008.  This represents more than a 40% loss for someone who didnt dca into it during that period.  People starting out this year should acknowledge that sort of thing could possibly happen over the next 8 years, even if you don't think it will.  

Individual stocks, even the safe, mature dividend stocks, can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions.  Competition pops up, costs increase, demand shifts, technology changes.  Nothing is 100% safe from a large drop given a bad turn of events.  Highly speculative stocks without earnings are even more sensitive and susceptible to large drops as we've seen recently.  Maybe these stocks continue to grow in anticipation of big future earnings, but they've also got the potential to lose most of their value if the market conditions turn against them.

Before I buy a stock, I go through the history and outlook for that company and also for that industry.  I take special note of downturns and acknowledge what I think is a reasonable downside for that particular stock.  Acknowledging and accepting those risks help me stay away from trades that are higher risk than I actually want, and helps me keep my conviction when my choices are struggling.

If you're new to investing and trading, make sure you give enough thought to how far the stock or etf you're researching could fall, and make a reasonable decision on if that fits with your appetite for risk.","['T', 'A']"

I am not a financial advisor and I am not good at writing DD’s with fancy colors and graphs. Please do your own research before investing

About 2 months ago we saw the fallout of Archegos, and Bill Hwang become a laughing stock after losing 20 billion dollars from his margin call. Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) were among the hardest hit in that selloff. Let’s cut to the chase on why this is this is ready for takeoff, and that big buyers are gonna swoop this back up to new highs 

For starters, the stock currently has a moderately high short interest ratio of 25%. It’s amongst the top shorted stocks within the NYSE. 

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/

On top of the moderately high short interest, you might notice $DISCA is the class A version of the stock. There are actually two other tickers discovery sells shares for: $DISCB and $DISCK. What’s very interesting is despite $DISCK and $DISCA shares trading relatively similar prices, $DISCB shares have actually soared since the selloff, and are trading at double the amount of the regular class A shares. What’s the difference between class A and class B shares? Simple.

“The difference between Class A shares and Class B shares of a company’s stock usually comes down to the number of voting rights assigned to the shareholder.  Class A shareholders generally have more clout”


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp

Now, why is this due for a squeeze? Today, news came out about AT&T wanting to combine media assets with discovery, pushing the valuation of the company to a whopping 150 Billion dollars. Currently, Discovery’s market cap sits at a valuation of 17.41 billion dollars, meaning this merger would push its valuation up 8.6x. I dont know about you guys but that sounds pretty wild to me.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/5aeba5f9-2e00-4cba-b9c7-e0431aad798b

Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

Doctor: “We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!”

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

&#x200B;

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

&#x200B;

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

&#x200B;

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

Stocks are down a bit in the pre-market with small-caps leading the drop. Russell 2000 is off 0.6%. Nasdaq, Dow and S&P down about 0.3% each. That’s as of 0610.

The weekend news was all about the crypto sell off, driven by Elon Musk’s tweets. At the time of this recording, digital coins have recovered from their lows after Musk ‘clarified’ that Tesla had not sold any bitcoin. BTC is now trading at around 45k. It was as low as 42k and change.

Friendly reminder that I don’t care about bitcoin or crypto and will discuss it only when I absolutely need to, like now. Quick interlude about cryptos’ place in investing that I’m not going to type out. Listen to the audio.

Last week was crazy volatile and investors are probably hoping for a bit more quiet this week. They may even get it, with not much on the economic data front and earnings season wrapping up. Whatever cash was generated from selling last week (and over the weekend) should find its way into some risk assets before long seeing how the risk free rate is still close to zero. The question is, which risk assets?

No major economic data releases on the docket today. The NAHB Housing Market Index for May is out at 10. Not much going on with earnings today either. Walmart, Home Depot, and Macy’s report tomorrow.","['NDAQ', 'WMT', 'HD', 'SPGI', 'TSLA', 'T', 'DOW', 'A']"

Advice Needed: Made a life changing mistake, need tax guidance

Hey guys, throwaway here as I’m too embarrassed to post under my real account.

I needed 100k in order to get enough for a down payment on a house, we’ve been saving up for 4 years but the market outpaced us (Bay Area). I’ve gotten very lucky over the past 18 months and turned 85k to 600k in my IRA trading options.

I decided to take a 60 day rollover loan, this is where you can take money out of your IRA for up to 60 days and if you put it all back within that time period you pay no taxes.

Anyways, my goal was to take the 600k from IRA to Brokerage, try and make a 20% return in 60 days and then return the initial 600k to the IRA. Well, I blew up, I’ve now lost 300k trading, I need help understanding the tax implications at this point. My assumption is that it’s game over and I’ll essentially need the remaining 300k just to pay my tax bill as early withdrawal will be income tax + 10%.

I know I’ve possibly made the biggest financial mistake of my life here, really looking for any advice on the tax situation here, appreciate any help that is provided.",['A']

nehv61,,investing,post,1621262038,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) DD.I should start off by saying that I am a dividend growth investor. I usually like investing in stocks where the risk vs. reward is appealing. In my opinion, Lockheed Martin fits into that category and is one of my largest positions.

BASIC COMPANY INFORMATION

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defence company which provides very high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the air force comes from this one company.

CEO INFORMATION

Lockheed recently announced in 2020 a new CEO to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet .While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company I might add).

DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS

Quarterly Payout (At A Glance)
2020 - $2.60
2019 - $2.40
2018 - $2.20
2017 - $2.00
2016 - $1.82
2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = ~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY  profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company has a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/stock-information/dividend-history

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

The company has a long history of M&A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year. 

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about ~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/balance-sheet/

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/cash-flow?p=LMT

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT

GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for  the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forcasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and badder weapons. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY

If you were given 10 million dollars, and your goal was to create a globally recognized soda brand, could you get it done? Maybe. What about 10 million to create a social media platform? Also a maybe. But could you start a aeronautics and/or defence company with 10 million budget? Absolutely not.

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of ~13.9. This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in. 

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defence budget.

Discussion of valuation methodology is lacking here and this sounds way too pitchy... This is not presenting the investor with valuable insight that they couldn't read by scanning the most widely available (and most widely abused) metric, price to earnings.

DCF valuation has an even better story to tell on LMT.  Why would you exclude that, other than because it requires some work?

Even so, some questions arise:

* What did they acquire for $10 billion over book and why hasn't that materialized into equivalent growth in operating cash?
* Why do they have such erratic shifts YoY in their receivables?  Is this part of a cyclical event unique to the aerospace/defense industry or an unusual item?  What is it?
* What did they acquire for $282 million in 2020?
* Why would you exclude discussion of dividend pricing models, e.g. Gordon Growth Model?

nehv61,gygn04w,investing,comment,1621268982,"Very nice DD. LMT is currently my second largest holding (got in at around 340 or so). One thing to mention is that the D&A sector has lagged quite significantly in the past year and therefore, represents a pocket of value that cannot be found elsewhere. The appealing PE ratio makes it a rare value pick for an S&P500 company.   
Also conflict (even though a very unfortunate case) would benefit LMT due to an increase reliance on the military. Geopolitically things are wobbily with Russia and China for example.   
Finally, a concern you should consider is that they are very reliant on rare earth minerals which are sourced primarily from China. Conflict with China can be a double edged sword for LMT.   
It is to be seen how the government will keep going, but the free cash flow and dividend history is very nice. Do have a price target for you at which you would start scaling out of this as other sectors become more appealing.","['D', 'LMT', 'A', 'SPGI']"

However if inflation rises much above what is expected and continues to stay high then I would expect the markets to have a strong reaction. As for what is priced in today, I think the market is pricing itself for a small risk of inflation having more sticking power, it seems so far the market is believing the FED for better or worse. I think what we’ve seen over the last 2 weeks as more inflation related data has come out is the market pricing the risk of sustained inflation, which doesn’t seem to be the current base case.

neo8g0,,investing,post,1621276954,"When interest rates go up, do stocks and bonds get hit the same?Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty right now and going forward in the markets (inflation, presumed high equity valuations, Covid/variants, re-opening, wars, cyber-attacks, the Fed tapering bond purchases, the imminent invasion of an army of meth-addicted rabbit warriors from the Xarthrax System), but assuming that all of those things are neutral, which asset class gets hit harder by an interest rate increase (if/when it happens)?

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well? Basically, all else being equal, simply from a growth point of view, which is better to hold when interest rates go up?

nepxu3,,investing,post,1621280985,"How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry styleThis is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on r/Burryology (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

 

***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***

If you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?

We now have the answer.

Here are the direct inflation plays:

*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*

*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).

*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.

*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*

*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.

*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.

*Others:*

1. *Shares of* *Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT) - 0.5%*
2. *Call options on Proshares ultrapro short 20 + year t (TTT)*

***Out with the REITs***

One of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:

* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)
* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)
* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)
* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)
* CoreCivic Inc - 3.07% (overall net increase in the total position, now 0.7%)

In Q1 2021, REITs accounted for just 1.3% of Scion's holdings. He exited out of Uniti and GEO, trimmed Urstadt and RPT Realty, and increased the CoreCivic position. All-in-all, it seems he's bearish on REITs serving as the best vehicle for profiting off of inflation compared to shorting the 20 year treasury bond.","['SPGI', 'T', 'A', 'ICE']"

nebp01,gyfyild,investing,comment,1621258387,"I'm going to copy/paste an article Matt Levine wrote when the whole GME mess was in full bloom.  The TLDR is that ""hyping up a stock"" is not market manipulation, and never really has been.  Those fines you are alluding to were likely tied to false statements or something similar - basically just getting together and saying ""let's all buy this stock, so it goes up and we make money"" isn't really illegal. 

Here's the copy/paste:


If a lot of people on Reddit band together to drive the price of a stock higher, is that illegal? I have been asked that question a lot recently, and I want to be clear that:

1.	I don’t know, and

2.	If I did know, I wouldn’t tell you, because I do not give legal advice in this newsletter, and I particularly do not give legal advice that people on Reddit might read while pumping up stocks.



That said I suppose we should talk about the question in general and extremely not-legal-advice terms. I guess my answer would be that it might be illegal in all sorts of ways, but it is not obviously illegal, and if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were to go after WallStreetBets for this stuff they will be breaking new ground and going beyond their previous cases. I do not want to say “this stuff is all fine,” but I will say I am not all that bothered by it.

There are two main things that are illegal. One is “securities fraud.” This basically means lying about a stock. The other is “market manipulation.” Nobody knows what this means. Legally, it means something like:

>To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security … creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.

So if you buy stock with the purpose of pushing the price up so that other people will buy it, that’s market manipulation. If you buy stock hoping that the price will go up because other people buy it, that’s not market manipulation; that’s just normal. Those things are not so different. There is a “traditional four-part test for manipulation that has developed in case law”: 

>(1) That the accused had the ability to influence market prices; (2) that the accused specifically intended to create or effect a price or price trend that does not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand; (3) that artificial prices existed; and (4) that the accused caused the artificial prices.


So consider the general concept of a “pump-and-dump” scheme. The most classic pump-and-dump goes like this:

  1) I buy some GameStop stock.


  2) I put out rumors—in my subscription newsletter, on Reddit, in fake press releases, whatever—about some catalyst for the stock to go up. “Hey I hear from an inside source that GameStop just got an exclusive contract to supply downloadable video games in Tesla cars,” etc.


  3) People see these rumors, believe them and buy GameStop stock, pushing the price up.


  4) I sell the stock to them at the higher prices.

This is very straightforwardly illegal and the SEC goes after this stuff all the time, alleging securities fraud. Lying about stocks. Here is the SEC’s “Investor Alert: Social Media and Investing -- Stock Rumors,” which pretty much defines a pump-and-dump this way:

>For example, in a “pump-and-dump” scheme, promoters “pump” up the stock price by spreading positive rumors that incite a buying frenzy and they quickly “dump” their own shares before the hype ends. Typically, after the promoters profit from their sales, the stock price drops and the remaining investors lose money.

There are variations. The SEC has gone after forms of dishonesty that aren’t quite lying about the stock. For instance, if you are a widely followed stock promoter with a subscription tip newsletter, and you email tips to your subscribers and then sell your stock to them while saying that you’re buying, that seems dishonest, and the SEC will go after you. Or if you are a promoter or research firm and you put out positive research about a company, but you don’t disclose that the company paid you to put out the research, that is also bad. 

Now, I think you could do a pump-and-dump without any actual lying. For instance:


1.	I email subscribers to my expensive private newsletter saying “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people, innocents and high-frequency trading algorithms, see it go up on heavy volume and think “hey this is a good stock, we should buy it.” They buy it, pushing the price up.

5.	We sell the stock to them at the higher prices.


In this version, I have not lied about a stock. On the other hand, I have effected transactions in the stock to create trading activity and raise the price, for the purpose of inducing people to buy it. Seems like market manipulation, “painting the tape” or something. The SEC goes after stuff like this occasionally.

I think that in modern markets you could even do a bit better than that and have a completely honest pump-and-dump:

1.	I show up on Reddit and say “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people see us doing this, read my Reddit post, know we are pumping the stock, and also buy it, because we seem to be having fun, and they like fun too.

5.	Eventually some of us get bored and start selling and the price collapses.","['TSLA', 'T', 'A']"

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

As a bonus, all of their old content is still new for the majority of the international audience, which they are expanding well into. At this point, there are so many streaming services, that streaming is becoming internet cable. Discovery is a natural pair for a multi-streaming household that wants an educational/mindless option.

i remember being able to actually post DD on WSBs without it being removed for ""Not being GME""

or posting on crypto currency and not having to talk about someone in the comments to tweet it to Elon so that their could be a pump of some sort

Anyways lets talk about what we came here to talk about.

Are you a Hype trader and what are they.

The following are pretty big points of pointing you out as Hype Trader or as i like to personally call them, BRO traders:

1. You started trading/investing after the pandemic (~March 2020 or later)

2. You tend to overly idolize Elon Musk and his tweets about where certain conditions in the market are

3. You bought Dogecoin AFTER $0.02 cents

4. You are losing most of your investment value as of present because all you bought was PLTR and NIO or similar stocks of that nature

5. You have since moved on from Stocks and are now more focused on Cryptos

6. You tend to ""buy the dips"" with no real analysis of why you should keep buying apart from gambling or other people telling you to do it

nemymh,,investing,post,1621273960,"SQQQ swing play then TQQQ?I'm thinking of awesome strategies to take advantage of developments in the market and was wondering if you guys could let me know if I'm on the right track here. Looking at October and February/March, charts look identical to how there was a dip, spike, dip to bottom, then slow stablization between the collapses. Last Friday we appear to have had the spike up before the 2nd dip to the bottom period. Judging by this the next 2 weeks will be deep red for the QQQ, and SQQQ may be a very good play. In fact, I'm already up 4% in SQQQ today alone. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone see any reason why it's not a good idea to hold SQQQ for a 2 week period that is pretty much a 100% sure thing for the market to be tanking, and then buy in TQQQ to get tripple gains for a few months? I heard the thing about decay, but would decay apply for short term 1-2 week investment periods?",['A']

ne89ei,,investing,post,1621231385,"Inflation and the self correcting economy?I'm hearing investors worry about inflation as a result of major coronavirus spending, and potentially higher rates and other forms of contractive monetary and fiscal policy, had I been a beginner in investing, this would frighten me. However the market has time and time again proven me again, and it is so tough to predict, which leads me to think it is self correcting, I also think the economy is relatively self correcting meaning the current doom and gloom may cause people to act differently in the markets and economy expecting inflation however it probably wont materialize and when people realize there's nothing to worry about the market takes off. I'm guessing at worst we will have a small decline with major upside, I'm not really changing anything in my portfolio, im holding a couple decent companies that do well and trade options with a small amount just to keep my trading instinct at bay, at the end of the day I believe the market is a game of ""see what can not be seen"" and that stocks rise pretty high despite crappy fundamentals, or fundamentals can be good despite a low price, eventually there is a reversion to the mean but who knows when.

ndpz45,,investing,post,1621176713,"ETFs focused on stem cell/regenerative tissue therapy biotech? (or single stocks you are particularly excited about)As many of you would probably agree, stem cell-based and other regenerative therapies are going to be a major market disrupter in the biotech and healthcare industries. There is [no shortage](https://bioinformant.com/biotech-investing-stem-cell-stocks/) of individual stocks in this area (also take a look at Humacyte).

Given that widespread adoption (and development) of the technology is still years off, and that there is tons of competition in the space, the probability that any single stock I were to choose listed in the link above is going to be a winner is likely quite low. 

I'm thinking that investing in an ETF focused on these technologies specifically might help lessen the risk a bit. In my searches so far, the only close match I could find that puts a lot of emphasis on stem cells and regenerative tech is [ARKG](https://ark-funds.com/arkg), but it has a much broader focus than stems cells/regenerative medicine alone (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). The major hesitance that I have about that fund is that it puts so much weight in Teledoc health (TDOC), which appears to be one of the major contributors the ARKG's decline over the past 6 months. I'm not entirely convinced that telehealth is the way of the future (but I'm biased because I prefer in-person visits, so feel free to convince me otherwise).

Are there any other ETFs that I should be looking at the place a lot of weight on stems cells/tissue regeneration? Or are there any single stocks I should be looking at that are promising pure-plays in this sub-sector?","['T', 'A']"

ndmymd,,investing,post,1621166872,"The Weekly DD - AT&T (T): A Bond ProxyWhat if I told you there was a stock that offers a \~6-7% dividend AND has potential for revenue growth, is that something you would be interested in? That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently **increased expectations** of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

It's 13-F season. May 17th is the deadline to report Q1'21 long positions. Some funds have already filled theirs. 

Here's Pabrai: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dalal-street-llc](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dalal-street-llc)

Here's Munger: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/daily-journal-corp](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/daily-journal-corp)

Keep in mind that they're both self-described value investors, which means that they spend a lot of time studying the ""margin of safety"". It allows them to take really concentrated positions in their highest conviction stocks than most other investors. They know they're not going to lose money on a 3 year + timeframe. 

Charlie Munger has 5 long positions, Mohnish Pabrai has just 3. 

Both are on record for saying that value investing no longer works in the US, but fishing in other parts of the world is easier. Non-value investors seem to agree as well. Cathie Wood is buying JD, Soros is buying BIDU.

Both Munger and Pabrai added just ONE stock in Q'1, the same stock. I think its a ""wonderful stock at a fair price"".

Valuation looks good: [https://ibb.co/PNJ0yct](https://ibb.co/PNJ0yct)

EPS growth projections look good too: [https://ibb.co/9NvMmqR](https://ibb.co/9NvMmqR)

Normally it's hard to guess their cost basis given that 13-Fs contain delayed data. In this case, we know for SURE that the best they could buy at was $220.

I excitedly bought my first lot yesterday at $209 after hours and I intend to DCA more over the next few months. MSCI China just entered bear territory, it's possible that we're near a floor.

I don't know much about business in China. I have no interest in building DCF models. I gave a cursory glance to the SEC filings and earnings transcripts, but given that BABA is an ADR and China disallows foreign auditors, I don't know how much to read into the numbers. 

One thing is for sure - I won't be able to slice and dice all this data better than the most respected value investors in the world, working only part time and weekends. 

But I can copy them, and fate has given me an opportunity to outdo them on price!

Looking out for Burry and Buffett's 13-Fs to hit EDGAR. If one of them has bought $BABA, I'm buying more stock. If both have, I'm going apeshit on leaps.

**Summary of The Trade Desk**

*The Trade Desk Inc is a global technology company that markets a software platform used by digital ad buyers to purchase data-driven digital advertising campaigns across various ad formats and devices.*


**What I learned from Q1 call** 

**Three Big Drivers for the future** 

* CTV 
* UID 2.0 
* Solimar Platform 

**So why do they matter?** 

**CTV** 
- CTV is an umbrella term, compromises of both Internet T.V and smart T.Vs.
- More consumers switching from Cable to CTV 
- Major content owners moving more premium content online 
- T.V providers continue to fight for consumer attention 

**Current Problem**
- Advertisers currently are paying premium prices to publishers (Websites like ESPN) without getting the value of said premium price. 
- The Trade Desk would allow them to not only receive that value but advertisers would now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV ads they buy and how to apply data driven decisioning in T.V at an increased scale.


**UID 2.0** 
- This in TTD's eyes is the future of the internet in a world without cookies. This would essentially replace them. 
- I will do my best to explain said function, but to understand why does this need to be a thing and what is it solving? 

**Current Problem** 
- What the TTD is trying to accomplish is to create a free and open internet, an internet that can move past the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Apple Ect. In fact the CEO Jeff Green uses the following sentence. ""Is the internet going to be controlled by large tech companies or will power be distributed. Will choice sit with consumers and each content owner?""

- We've heard of google and apple ending third party cookies in an attempt to ""protect"" their customers, which is true to an extent. 

**What UID 2.0 going to do to change the internet** 
- UID 2.0 is Open Source meanings you are able to build on it, and it is about a better internet allowing consumers to have control.
 
**How it Works** 

**1)** Consumers sign in once with an email (this email is your *common ID*)
**2)**  You will opt in site by site, app channel only once
**3)** When you log in once, you will receive an email authentication providing consumers with the explanation of the value exchange of the internet. The idea is to make it clear and consistent. 
**4)** This common ID will be used by advertisers and publishers 
**5)** Consumers are then able to use privacy settings to change or opt out directly from the services they know. 
**6)** The consumer controls their data, it's not controlled by Big Tech. 

**But its Big Tech, how can they penetrate those ""Walled Gardens""?** 

- *Double Encryption Publishers (DEP)*
- This allows publishers to encrypt UID 2 and allows them to unencrypt it for certain advertisers or publishers. DEP prevents others from taking data and insight from publishers. (Yes even Big Tech) 

**Solimar** 

- Solimar is the TTD's biggest platform upgrade in their history (Well that's what Jeff said)
- It is bringing together current existing features TTD offers and is making it easy to use for marketers 
- **Koa AI** for example is a current feature the is being upgraded and integrated into Solimar 

**Koa AI** 
- Koa AI is well... AI. It analyzes data from across the internet to help make sure you’re reaching the right audience at the right price. As Koa learns, it optimizes your campaigns automatically.

- ""Solimar helps advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. Building that off-site data into Solimar, whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals."" - Jeff Green

- He explains it better than I could
 
- Solimar helps solve the problem of media marketers who have big plates to fill and who are running massive campaigns. 
- Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management

*Solimar Platform



Would love to hear opinions about TTD, discussing what the future looks like right now. For a stock that was a 2020 winner and is hurting in 2021 (much like others) TTD doesn't carry debt and actually makes money unlike many of other popular 2020 winners.","['FB', 'GOOGL', 'V', 'T', 'AAPL', 'A']"

ndfhbz,,investing,post,1621135820,"GOOGL - What am I missing?I am typically a value oriented investor and focus heavily on valuations.  Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.  I find it weird that these mods can just post their OPINION on these threads and state it as if it is a FACT.  All of my thesis and modeling is clearly opinion and open to discussion, where the Mod is not for whatever reason.","['D', 'GOOGL', 'A']"
ndfhbz,gyc71kk,investing,comment,1621182216,"Approving this post because it does involve valuation discussion. HOWEVER, I'm approving it with guidance.

EV/EBITDA isn't to be given deference *over* DCF both because Enterprise Value is derived in part from market capitalization (circuitous and uncorrelated), and because earnings is easily manipulated, cash flow is not. In the financial analysis world, after performing several different valuation methods, we don't then simply disregard or discard the one that doesn't give us the answer we want.

When DCF vehemently disagrees with EV/EBITDA, that's a good suggestion that EBITDA is misleading or being massaged through accounting treatments to make earnings look more consistent... and that's precisely what's happening here. This is an indicator that we need to look at the financials more closely.

Their AR leaped, their unusual items doubled year over year, and their earnings are buttressed by, for the last three years specifically, enormous increases in investment (read: non-operating) income. What are these investments, exactly, and if we can replicate their returns why would we invest in GOOGL knowing that their operating margins are actually flat and the DCF analysis is therefore spot on.

We buy undervalued companies because of their durable competitive advantage. There are other companies allocating investment capital for a higher return whose stocks are trading at a discount to fair value, so GOOGL isn't particularly attractive in this regard and they are definitely not undervalued.

From a Graham perspective, GOOGL is trading at around a 10% premium. That is the antithesis of a margin of safety, which is also the reason to lean toward, not away from, DCF analysis.","['GOOGL', 'T', 'A']"

ndupku,,investing,post,1621190190,"Turkcell Communication Services ($TKC), why you should/shouldn't invest in it. Fundamentals of an undervalued stock.Hi everyone! This is gonna be a long wall of text, I will write a tl;dr as well so please check the bottom if it scares you.

**Why TKC?**

So I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&name=small)

**About the company**

So the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).

**Financials**

I don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.

[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)

[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)

Their net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.

**Possible things that may drive the value up.**

I already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.

Another thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.

Lastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.

**One important thing that caught my eye**

Last month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**

**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**

As I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**

Another thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).

&#x200B;

**Summary**

I believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone. But even with those risks, I dont think it will devaluate more at this point.","['T', 'A', 'V']"

ndd7oo,gya0tzi,investing,comment,1621128915,"Thanks for the post. I have worked in corporate finance for a long time.  Intrinsic value still has a lot of benefit when investing, but it’s just one pillar of analysis a well rounded investor should consider. 

DCFs are great if you trust your assumptions or have a sensitivity range to gauge various margin assumptions. It’s also predicated on you being able to accurately calculate a company’s WACC, which isn’t always easy. But if you have a robust DCF and understanding of how a business will invest in capex, it can be quite useful in determining present value to investors. The problem is we don’t all have inside knowledge of a company’s plan to, say, open a new production facility, so it’s hard to forecast many of these items. Terminal values are also a bit tough because the wrong assumption can throw your present value askew. 

That’s why various valuation approaches should be considered. Looking at comps is helpful because it shows where others in the industry are trading. Looking at rates is helpful Because the value of a company’s earnings are seen relative to other investments. 

If you want to talk more about what goes into a good DCF and focus on that methodology, there are a lot of debate points to be discussed.","['T', 'A']"
ndd7oo,gya8ltc,investing,comment,1621133443,"I'm actually extremely annoyed at how little attention DCF gets on this subreddit. It's like everyone here is afraid of math, and I really believe it's a travesty that there is essentially zero data-based analysis on this subreddit. IMHO most ""DD"" is borderline useless because they do not even attempt to derive a valuation.

Your typical DD goes something like this: OP points at a $1 million dollar house and says:

* Bull case: Houses are useful and everyone needs to live in a house.
* Bear case: Houses can burn down or have termites.
* Analysis: Houses are the future. Buy the house.

Like, of course, all of these things are true (obviously so), but the real question is ""How much is that house actually worth? Why should I buy this house compared to that house over there?"" See, where DCF really shines is in comparative analysis; if you take two competitors in the same industry (say, Intel vs AMD), DCF will tell you what the *relative* value is between these companies, and therefore guide you to pick one over the other. *That's* the kind of content I upvote in a heartbeat, because it actually encourages analytical thinking rather than thinly-veiled hype. I want this to be an analysis subreddit dammit, not an advertising subreddit!

Additionally, nobody (especially in the meme investing subreddits) really seems to understand how markets price securities, and act shocked and indignant when share prices drop even after decent-looking earnings reports. Nobody considers what the market is **already expecting**, and then cry foul when the market adjusts its expectations in the direction they're not expecting.

In the end, I think most individual stock analysis in r/investing is only useful as a form of entertainment, because most of it is either totally non-rigorous or [flat-out wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ek84pk/i_got_bored_and_went_through_amazons_financial/) (look at some of the other highly-upvoted comments on that post, and realize just how many of them didn't realize that they were reading nonsense). Most of the Redditors who ""made it big"" on meme stocks and crypto exemplify survivorship bias to the fullest extent possible. Success in playing the market does **not** imply investing skill, much in the same way that success at the roulette table doesn't imply clairvoyant abilities.","['AMD', 'T', 'INTC', 'A']"
ndd7oo,gya6qf9,investing,comment,1621132326,"Well this is a potentially explosive post. 

A well crafted DCFs will give some indication of the intrinsic value of a company. The valuation of that company however can significantly depart from its intrinsic value which Damodaran has covered extensively on this personal blog. This particular post on the GameStop saga is a great example of Damodaran's explanation on Value vs. Price: ([http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-price-value-feedback-loop-look-at.html](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-price-value-feedback-loop-look-at.html)). 

I'm a CPA and about a year ago I started doing a Msc. in Finance because I had a lot of questions around value, capital markets, capital decisions, etc. which I was interested in exploring deeper and the internet alone wasn't doing it for me anymore. 

Now that I'm about 1/2 through the degree, I am convinced that if you are about to buy into a stock, you should consider ALL angles such as: understanding the company the company, its accounting fundamentals, do a DCF to estimate the intrinsic value, perform sensitivity tests to check for variability of your estimate to changes in a few parameters. Then you should also look at the stock's industry and finally, as someone pointed below, you have to understand the macro-context which might lift/sink assets prices (current vs. future monetary policies, fiscal policies, regulation, anti-competitive outlook, etc)

Once you have all of this in hand, there is no guarantee of being wrong or right but you can at least feel like make an informed decision. Which then leaves the final question: what is your time horizon and/or exit strategy?

Therefore, to answer your original question, I don't think you are putting effort in something that doesn't matter. If anything you are deepening your understanding. Also, for kicks and giggles, if you do enough research to at least attempt a DCF, you probably already have done more 'due diligence' than what I have seen get posted on WallStreet Bets as 'DD'.

We all know of the first two entries, and the third is a fund that holds the S&P along with a complex array of derivatives.

The outperformance of PSLDX is pretty clear. I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. 

I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2016)

Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.

[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)

You'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. 

The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. 

It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  

I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. 

Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it's more complex than a simple passive ETF.","['O', 'SPGI', 'T', 'A']"

100% PSLDX may be suitable for you if:

(1) You want your US-International split to be 100% US and 0% international.

(2) You want exposure to US stock through derivatives equivalent to investing 100% of net assets in the S&P 500.

(3) You want your bond duration to be 10 years or more (currently, a duration of around 15 years).

(4) You're okay with leverage that is currently about 2.55x (about 155% bonds) that can vary.

(5) You're okay with a treasury bond percentage that is currently about 40% and that can vary.

(6) You're okay with investing up to 10% of total assets in junk bonds, up to 30% of total assets in foreign currency bonds, and up to 10% of total assets in preferred securities, as chosen by active management. In general, you're okay with the active fixed income management.

(7) You're not afraid to pay a 0.59% management fee and the costs of leverage (both those included and not included in the 1.11% expense ratio), in exchange for higher risk & return through leverage. You also know you don't want to trade derivates directly.

(8) You're not worried about the manager risk.

(9) Your annual savings don't exceed your available tax-advantaged space.

The ratio of stocks to bonds (1:1.55) makes this something close to a leveraged 35-65 or 30-70 portfolio, but the big bond allocation behaves a lot differently than a portfolio with 70% treasury bonds because of the credit quality of the bonds. In any case, it's the kind of portfolio that has high Sharpe, historically, and it's not a bad portfolio to leverage up. You could do a lot worse.

Even so, I think you could improve on it by adding some international stock. Averaging in international reduces the probability of both very good and very bad returns from equities. Lowering leverage a little bit also reduces risk.

If you're going to need the money anytime soon, then it's a pretty aggressive portfolio. It is somewhat more aggressive than just being 100% stocks, since it also has higher expenses, leverage costs, and adds the risks of the bonds on top. It has no inflation-protected bonds, and at the same time unexpected inflation that leads to higher yields will hurt the long duration bonds that it loads up on. You can only buy so much in I Series savings bonds per year, which currently have good terms for an inflation-protected bond, so you might want to consider doing some of that too","['SPGI', 'T', 'A']"

Clearway Energy; the yieldco, not the developer. I recommend you look at including a few yieldco in general, these are essentially the operating vehicles of completed power generation infrastructure. In simple terms, the wind or solar farm has been built (=derisked!) and is operating, generating a return. You buy these for the dividend returns, not necessarily growth. 

Siemens Energy; big player in renewable generation, but also in smart grids, storage - all very important to make the transition into renewables work.

NextEra Energy; solid pipeline of renewable projects, set up for growth. 

Orsted; as above; developer. The dominant force in offshore wind for years to come

Aker Offshore Wind; bit of a bet. They have set themselves up for dominance in floating offshore wind. I'm a firm believer, but it's fair to say this is a riskier bet

BP; a controversial one, I know. But big oil money is needed to accelerate the renewables transition and they are going to change the playing field. BP is making the right moves, but yes, you're still putting your money into big oil for the time being... Also good dividend return.

Since my son was born in 2017, I’ve been contributing to a progressive CD through my credit union. The interest results are trash. I initially put in $1k and slowly added when I could. Over the past 6 months or so, I’ve set up an automatic payment to put $2 into it daily. The results have been obviously adding up, but the interest is less than a weeks contributions. 

As I’ve been dabbling in stocks over the past year or so, I haven’t been doing great in it, but I am not down. I am only up about 10% in a year due to my own impulse and lack of patience. But I think I’d rather put his CD into a single stock or ETF that will grow even half that much in a year because it will get better growth.

There are so many ETF’s and stocks that are solid long runners. But the question is what should I put that money into that’s going to grow stabile while still continuing to do a daily/weekly contribution? It’s currently sitting at ~$2500 but will grow to about $2800 by the time it matures and I’m able to withdrawal.

She argues that commodity prices are spiking currently because companies are over ordering to try to keep up with spikes in sudden post pandemic demand and she feels that there will be a blow off and correction in commodity prices in the future. She thinks that the only real risk of inflation is actually the dollar collapsing relative to other currencies and if that happens she will revisit her view of it. Her conclusion is that there is no reason to be concerned about a continuing bull market. IMO not sure why she gets hate as she is clearly an intelligent economist.

ncp9na,,investing,post,1621047062,"Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trendshttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth.","['DG', 'T', 'A', 'D']"

There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings.","['T', 'A', 'ARKK']"

ncgfqa,,investing,post,1621019470,"Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March DataFears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.

Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.

Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.

James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.

The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.

By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 

March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""

Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued.","['TWTR', 'T', 'A']"

nc8k9r,,investing,post,1620998751,"Value-investing perspective/advice to someone that just swallowed the S&P black pill?I posted some of this yesterday and didn't get much traction in daily questions of r/investing, so I'm going to rework it for this sub:

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

Either to dampen volatility, provide something to rebalance against during the equity dips, improve risk-adjusted returns due to low correlations to lever an optimal portfolio...

This is everything I've heard, but I'm just believing it less and less.

I did a quick test here just on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7xOheId6-4rdjC6HHa-hemlfH7u6SZGT9d6i8cXVYU/edit?usp=sharing). In short here is the performance of $100,000 (dates are rough, not the definitive start and end dates of the period in the titles)

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).","['D', 'GOOGL', 'T', 'A']"

nbqj5j,gy12lrp,investing,comment,1620942542,"There's two valid principles embedded in the standard glide path wisdom: 

* Risk can be expressed as volatility (and therefore risk tolerance can be expressed via leverage, as it's more or less a straight multiplier on volatility). As your liabilities come due (i.e., you're about to retire), you should be de-risking (aka de-leveraging). 

* Diversification between uncorrelated assets improves risk-adjusted returns.

I believe the glide path wisdom is a way to package these principles in an imperfect but marketable way for the average investor. The bond component (usually investment-grade, short to intermediate duration, so low risk overall) somewhat serves the purpose of cash (100/0 -> 60/40 is like going from 1X to 0.6X). And you're bumping up your risk-adjusted return over time. All while staying away from actual leverage, which is a boogeyman to most people.

Bridgewater's beta portfolio and other risk parity frameworks implement these principles more directly, in a way that makes more sense to me. The bond component would be allocated such that its risk is on par with the equity component (it may be closer to 80% bonds and 20% stocks than vice-versa), and then leverage is applied to target whatever level of risk you want. For bonds, these portfolios usually use treasuries because a) credit risk is more correlated to equity risk than term risk (AGG has both and therefore would be more correlated to stocks than say IEF), and b) treasury futures is an excellent way to achieve leverage. Usually other assets are included as well to account for regime changes, including ones where stock/bond correlation increases; the glide path may be a product of its time, in which stocks and bonds were anti-correlated while both maintaining excess return due to falling R*.","['DE', 'A']"

Going 100% in equities will not offer larger returns if you had sold out during the ‘08 crash or the Covid crash. If holding 10% to 40% in bonds makes it to where you won’t panic sell, then you’ll come out ahead compared to the person 100% in VOO who does panic sell.",['T']

nc2i7c,,investing,post,1620975834,"Exxon Mobile - upcoming annual vote contested to push company in greener directionWondering what everyone's thoughts are on the upcoming Exxon annual vote that's being contested by a group called Engine No 1? They are seeking to break up the current board and vote in 4 of their own candidates in order to push the company into a greener direction. To grab a quote off their [website](https://reenergizexom.com/), ""ExxonMobil lacks a plan to create shareholder value in a world that seeks to decarbonize"".

I'm not really a seasoned investor, but I generally agree that Exxon stock has been underperforming for years partly because of increased demand and feasibility of cleaner energy, and the end of the petroleum energy's dominance is encroaching (we're inevitably going to run out of the stuff). The only ""green"" move by Exxon has been to invest heavily in carbon capture and storage; which is fine, but I'd like to see Exxon soon put together a solid plan to gradually transition out of strictly petroleum and get more involved in wind, solar, and other renewables - I'm most likely being really naive here.

In theory I like Engine No 1's objective but I guess my main concern is how effective or sincere they would be in their push for green and cleaner energy? Maybe they're just some investment firm using all this as an opportunity to place their own members on Exxon's board who'll just cash in and ultimately won't fulfill their stated objectives? I honestly don't know, and Engine No 1 probably won't get the votes they're looking for anyway. I'm anticipating that at some point I'm going to eventually divest from Exxon while putting more of my money into clean energy ETFs or something.

Anyone want to share their opinions or insights on any of this?

Chinese population growth slowed according to CNBC - China Census [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/chinas-census-shows-population-growth-slowed.html)*^(Important because the perception of slowing population growth can lead to less growth potential for the company)*

Charlie Munger invests in Alibaba (approx. 165,000 shares) [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html)

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

**TLDR:** In a land of unattractive valuations in the current stock market environment, Alibaba with a forward P/E of \~20 seems extremely attractive for a long term investment despite short term volatility.","['AMZN', 'T', 'WU', 'A']"

I have been watching ABNB price movement for a while, and it has been trending lower since Feb 2021. The price moved from $200ish to $134.  I initially purchased ABNB at $149ish and wanted to add more.  How low do you think ABNB will be?  According to a Motley Fool article, ABNB sold 51,551,723 million class A share at $68, and almost 80% of the shares are held by insiders and can't be sold until after the company reports earnings for the first quarter of 2021 on May 13. Even if we have a positive earning report  today, I tend to think that the lockup expiration could force the price even lower. I plan to buy more share at or around $110, but I feel like it could go even lower than that.  Thank you for sharing your input.

**Update:** Lock-up will be lifted on May 17.

Performance relative to analyst estimates: 

Revenue: $887 million vs. $719.8 million expected.

Net loss: $1.2 billion vs. $341 million expected.

As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stocks because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

And maby a high inflation might make it more difficult for companies to make profits but that's all I can think of. 

So, why be scared? The real scary part of inflation should drive you into stocks not out of it.

I could save my money and buy a second juicer and ice machine and open a second stand in a different neighborhood,  but intrest rates are near zero so I borrowed money from the bank and open a second stand and I've doubled my sales and profits minus a little bit to make the loan payments. My investors are happy. 

I've got my eye on another two locations,  but I get hit by a double whammy, the bank is going to charge me a higher interest rate for a new loan and the price of lemons and sugar have gone up so I'm only making 10 cents per cup.   The people in the neighborhood haven't gotten a raise so it's hard for me to raise prices so I don't open up any new neighborhoods.   My growth rate is flat,  or maybe even down if people are paying more at the grocery store and have less money to spend on lemonade.  If my sales drop far enough I may not even be able to pay my loan payments and I'll go bankrupt.

nbocck,,investing,post,1620932304,"Let’s discuss covered calls.If you are investing covered calls or are interested in them let’s discuss it on this forum. 

I have recently gotten into covered calls because I like the risk reward that they offer. 

Let’s break down what covered calls mean. 

A covered call is when you buy 100 shares of stock and then sell a call contract. 

Covered means that you own the 100 shares so you are not using leverage since you own all shares of the contract. 

Calls are options that allow a buyer to collect profits after the price hits the strike price. 

When you do covered calls you sell these options on the options market. 

When you sell an option you get paid for the option to buy the stock at your strike price. I like setting my strike a few dollars above the current price. 

When the deadline of the option passes this contract expires. If the stock price is below the strike price then you keep all your shares plus the cost of the option. If it expires above the strike price then you give that money back to the person who purchased your option. 

Even if you have to pay someone that purchased your option that is a good thing as it means that you have recieved maximum profit on your trade. 

Worst case scenario the stock price drops. In this scenario you would be better off than the guy that just held 100 shares because you are also holding 100 shares but unlike a normal stock buyer you were able to collect the premium from when you sold the option. 


I love covered calls",['A']

nbhwdk,,investing,post,1620916062,"Criteo Earnings Update - Progressing in the right directionI wrote about Criteo’s DD in February, pointed out why the company is a hidden gem among adtech companies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B. 

- Google/Apple privacy updates will benefit those adtech companies that already owns 1st Party data, in this case Criteo is very well positioned. Criteo’s ecommerce reach is around $2B/day and enjoys exclusive access to major retailers/publishers. 

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt. The company is having a buyback program of up to $100m this year, which has been used by $5m in Q1. 

Because of the above reasons, I believe Criteo provides good risk/reward as an investment.","['T', 'AAPL', 'A', 'HD']"

nbc8xj,gxyplbk,investing,comment,1620903389,"First post so go easy on me... 

I'm 28 and as many others also have I have started to be serious about investing in the stock market with savings accounts interest rates so low. I'm UK based and can invest 20k/yr within an ISA wrapper to avoid taxes on capital gains. 

I own a house, have approx 220k on my mortgage which has a locked in rate of 1.84% for the next 4.5 years. I have student debt of approximately 17k at 1.25%. I don't have any finance on cars etc. 

I have around 25k in savings and have kept back 10k as a rainy day fund so have 15k available to invest. 

I was originally planning on buying in at around £500/week in various funds to try and avoid lump summing it and then markets tanking (like they seem to be potentially doing currently!) 

My time horizon is initially around 7-8 years when I plan on upgrading the house, then long term towards retirement. Currently working full time in a secure job.

I realise I'm really lucky to have this opportunity to hopefully try and invest my money wisely but it seems there's a lot of uncertainty currently with post Covid recovery/inflation etc. My risk tolerance is fairly high I feel but probably hard to say until you experience it). 

Over the past few days there's been a fairly big tech sell off it seems and a lot of panic/fear. 

Would anyone consider a different approach to averaging in my money over the next 6 months? Would you put a decent lump sum in after corrections downwards? Any advice greatly appreciated from those more experienced in the markets than myself! (I realise I have to make these decisions myself and you can't give officially financial advice, just a bit if brainstorming.)","['T', 'A']"
nawyv7,,investing,post,1620847246,"The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortageA lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.","['T', 'A']"

nb3f9x,,investing,post,1620864506,"Holding USD vs. EUR right now.I'm a US citizen living in the Eurozone. I hold both currencies for obvious reasons.

Right now I'm overweight in USD as that's where I have most of my non-short-term savings. I'm wondering, however, if it wouldn't make sense to exchange some of these dollars for euros and hold those instead.

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

The next question is if it would make sense, as I've said, to hold more euros instead of dollars.

Obviously there's a lot of factors to consider besides inflation, especially the forex relationship that I don't quite understand.  Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?

There's also other risks like the US dollar potentially being more reliable, etc.

Any thoughts or insight is appreciated.  This sort of micromanagement may be more trouble than it's worth since I'm not sitting on millions (lol), but I figured I'd ask and see what sort of knowledge I can glean.  Thanks!","['D', 'T', 'A']"

Inflation in the US can also mean that the Fed is more likely to raise rates sooner, which will make the dollar a lot stronger, quickly.

I have a similar issue, having to hedge a couple of currencies (including EUR), and I do it by buying a bit more stocks from companies based in the respective countries/regions which presumably offsets some of the currency risk, while keeping me invested.

nabnrv,,investing,post,1620778132,"Cathie Wood: Deep Dive Into Her 20+ Year Performance HistoryHow could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

Given the CPI jump today, this auction became that much more important to watch and I thought you fellows would appreciate a take on how it went.

In short, today's auction was an excellent one. A+ grade really.

Why?

Dealers had to keep 19.49% of the issued securities versus six month average at 24.2%

Direct buyers took 17.1% of the issued bonds versus six month average at 16.4%

Indirects (generally foreign investors) took 63.4% of the issued bonds versus the 59.4% six month average.

But most importantly of all, the yield dropped 1.3 basis points after the auction despite all the upward pressure today from the news which shows strong demand. The bond markets arent buying the inflation fears it seems.",['A']

nash4a,,investing,post,1620835947,"I was bored and thinking about Ark funds. So I decided to do a breakdown to see how much of each fund is represented within ARKK. Figured I'd share if anyone else was interested.Hi all, 

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one. 

Anyway thought this was a fun exercise and figured I'd share if anyone else were interested. 

Long story short is ARKK is actually a pretty good sum of all of the other funds. If you want to keep it simple, just go with ARKK.","['D', 'T', 'A', 'ARKK']"

n9zazb,,investing,post,1620746022,"Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

nadzhy,,investing,post,1620785496,"Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/sam-zell-buys-gold-with-inflation-reminiscent-of-the-1970s

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”","['T', 'A']"

narr02,,investing,post,1620834154,"Western Digital - The Next NvidiaAs the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.","['AMD', 'FB', 'AMZN', 'T', 'WDC', 'NVDA', 'A']"

Literally the only problem with this stock, at least in my eyes, is their overwhelming float of shares - but I'm not sure if this or the market cap really matters, it's an extremely high-volume and liquid stock that will probably have ~40-50% solid gains annually (so long as we don't tank by mid-2022, which of course remains a possibility on the table at current valuations anyway).

n9snsw,gxpqg7e,investing,comment,1620730170,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are dropping this morning, with tech and small caps leading the way lower. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 already down 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. S&P 500 futures down 0.8%. Dow Industrials 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0635.

This follows another day of selling in tech. The Nasdaq was down 2.5% yesterday, its worst day since March. The index is now down 4% this month. Sell in May? Well, Dow Industrials are up 2.5% and the S&P is green as well (barely).

This begs two questions: 1. What’s causing the tech sell-off? 2. Is it a buying opportunity?

The former appears to be this ‘rotation trade’ into cyclicals (and staples). I suspect interest rate hikes are starting to be priced in as well. The latter I discuss on the audio.

n93uwi,,investing,post,1620651600,"CNBC: A psychedelic drug boom in mental health treatment comes closer to reality CMPS MNMD CLXPF ATAI by Eric RosenbaumMental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

&#x200B;

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

So I'm fairly new in this topic. I did some reading in the threads provided here but it didn't quite provide the answers I was looking for.

Currently I (27M) am working in a company that provides a ESPP, up to 15% of my salary monthly, purchased in 6 month installments (at a 15% discount). I can change my contribution once per year (every May) and cash out every 6 months (after the purchase has been completed). Currently I contribute 3% of my salary only, but want to bump it up to 10%. The ESPP is done via eTrade. This is where my questions begin: I would like to sell my stocks (as I don't want to be holding single stock) and invest in some ETFs or something more secure. I see Vanguard recommended a lot on here but since my plan is through eTrade I would prefer keeping it simple and using them- but how do I begin?

Any good resources to read up on this, to properly set up my account for this and any other tips to a beginner?

One additional note I would make is that I am a dual citizen (US/German) and live and pay taxes in Germany. However the Etrade account is US based, and in USD. What sort of tax implications do I face and how do I deal with them?

n94bfc,,investing,post,1620652939,"Some long-term strategies worth remembering in today's speculative and volatile marketsBefore we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

(collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

The inverse also tends to be true on what to sell. Sell off low growth yield, sell off companies that are going to be adversely affected by rising wage input prices or rising input prices for the base commodities. 

**So in other words, go long on:** Oil, metals miners, agricultural inputs, banks, insurance companies, companies with pricing power. Industrials (XLI) tend to be good at the start of reflation, but as inflation starts to bite into the economy, a lot of the industrials end up getting hit hard from high producer price inputs. Industrials tend to be sensitive to demand from emerging markets, so a lot depends on what is going on there.

n8nkcd,,investing,post,1620594296,"Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4.

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?","['D', 'T', 'A']"

Leveraged real estate does not outperform unleveraged investment in the S&P.  It doesn't outperform it historically, and we would expect the gap to widen as real estate prices continue to rise.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

n8hkut,,investing,post,1620577266,"Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.

Not to mention the constant deadlock on gun control, I assume as a US person, all other countries are becoming more and more strict on gun control, making guns harder to obtain and more socially unacceptable.

War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growth, not the civilian market.

Guns are on a long-term growth trend, but to a large degree, guns sales the past several months have been driven by a) yearly seasonal effects (hunting season + people blowing their tax returns), b) a Presidential election year, which always sees higher gun sales and c) the pandemic and ensuing recession caused a buying spree.

Right now all three of those effects are going away, so I expect gun sales to decelerate rapidly over the next few months.   I've finally found some guns I've been looking for in stock again after months of them being sold out, which suggests my thesis is correct.

n8fpef,,investing,post,1620571698,"Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.","['O', 'GOOGL', 'T', 'A']"

Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

So the whole idea of CET1 is that it's capital the bank's investors stand to lose.  That's usually equity, but also any earnings they're entitled to which is why retained earnings and AOCI get lumped in there.  In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize.

After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.","['CB', 'T', 'A']"

Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

I think it's questionable that fund managers should be out there predicting their returns for the next 5 years. I can't recall another retail fund manager that has ever been in the press predicting literal % returns for the next 5 years (or 1 year for that matter.) A manager might say ""I expect a good year for tech"" if they're a tech fund or that sort of thing but I can't recall another mutual fund or ETF manager saying ""I predict X% annualized for my fund for the next 5 years."" I thought it was iffy when she did it earlier this year and now she's doing it again. So to me it's not even the math of the projections but the fact that she continues to do it in the first place.

She's really ""hyper growth all the time"" - the issue becomes it's not going always be in favor (and I think people took last year's unbelievable/once in a great while performance as confirmation/validation of hyper growth rather than possibly a ""grand finale"" - at least for a while - to cap off a decade where growth was largely the ""only game in town""), but she invests as if that's the case. Look at recently with her selling large liquid names into declines so she can buy even more of smaller, less liquid things a lot of which she already owns 10% or more of. What if she sells all the large liquid names and the decline keeps going? I wish Ark could be more dynamic in its approach - it feels like everything has to be hyper growth all the time or it's not ""on brand.""

""But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline.""

Employed $3500 USD p/m

Objectives: Long term growth and investment / retirement

Time horizon 10-15 yrs

Risk tolerance: moderate

Holdings $6000 USD, no debt, $3000 USD liquidity

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.","['SPGI', 'A']"

n7802u,,investing,post,1620418954,"Competition is Growing in the Telehealth SectorThe pandemic has changed a lot of things for good, including healthcare. Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* MTCH

* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

ndzjrr,,StockMarket,post,1621203634,"What if there is no tech bubble? Maybe it's time to accept that tech will be outperforming other sectors because it is going to be a bigger and bigger part of our world day by day**This is not an attack. This is not cynicism. This is a genuine discussion. I am here to learn and I'm open to changing my mind and hearing opposing views.**

I've been hearing the same argument since early 2019. ""When the tech bubble pops... bla bla bla... so don't go all in on tech stocks"". Yet here we are. Tech stocks are stronger than ever. What strong indication is there that tech stocks will just suddenly pop and the rest of the market will be stronger than them? I'm talking long term.

Perhaps it's time to face our new reality and accept the fact that we live in a highly technological society where everything to a huge degree depends on tech.

Now I don't mean every tech stock is the same. I'm talking about big names. I'm saying that one can outperform S&P500 by going all in on big tech stocks or just investing in only-tech ETFs.

I for one simply cannot see Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc. going anywhere anytime soon. And for that very reason I don't see anything wrong going all in on those stocks.

Once again, I'm talking LONG TERM (5+ years).

Bottom line is: pick a few tech stocks (trustworthy names such as Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft) OR pick a good tech ETF OR if you feel adventurous pick a leveraged ETF (NYSE:FANG+, FNGU, etc.) and forget about S&P500 and other sectors.

**This is not financial advice.** This is not a suggestion. DYOR. I am NOT recommending anyone to buy or sell anything. This is NOT portfolio advice. This is **O N L Y** a discussion and I want to be proven wrong because **I know I'm biased** and believe in tech stocks too much. I just feel that tech is here to stay and it will be stronger by day (VR/AR, blockchain-dependent tech, many other things coming up that will be massive over time).","['NVDA', 'FB', 'FANG', 'GOOGL', 'SPGI', 'AMZN', 'T', 'AAPL', 'O', 'L', 'A', 'MSFT']"

The first group of companies is going to do fine. I'd rather have a share of Google than a 30 year treasury with a yield of 2.35%. They might take a bit of a haircut if rates go up substantially or if there are any big antitrust actions or tax increases, but nothing too crazy.

That second group is where the bubble is. If Doordash is not profitable during a f\*cking pandemic, when are they going to be profitable? Is a company like that really worth $45B which is around the same as Ford? Speaking of Ford, is marginally profitable Tesla really worth 12x times as much?

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips 
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

neq3p7,,StockMarket,post,1621281371,"How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style 

This is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***

If you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?

We now have the answer.

Here are the direct inflation plays:

*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*

*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).

*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.

*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*

*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.

*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.

*Others:*

1. *Shares of* *Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT) - 0.5%*
2. *Call options on Proshares ultrapro short 20 + year t (TTT)*

***Out with the REITs***

One of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:

* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)
* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)
* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)
* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)

Without government subsidies and the occasional pump and dump, Tesla still would struggle with profitably. Less risk long term, because at this point it isn't going anywhere, but the returns at its current price I don't think will be great. Because it's priced for perfection, which is actually slightly better than earlier this year it was priced for world domination. So comparing NIO to Tesla is probably not the best thing you can do.

Additionally NIO isn't without its own risk. The US and China relationship is strained and the government has already floated the idea of delisting Chinese stocks. Given that you could make a case that NIO is more fairly priced than Tesla, thus the better buy, but comes with risk and thus also overvalued

Since then the price has been trying to break above key resistance at $4.50, but so far unsuccessfully.

The break above $4.50 is necessary in order to bring the short term uptrend. The break of $4.50 also represents the break above the 50 EMA. 

Dip at $4.30 has created a new lower high, positive sign.

But as the tests of $4.50 were unsuccessful we look for a retest of the trend of lower highs, a dip which has to be bought in order to break the $4.50 resistance.

Current resistance is at $4.50, while support is at $4.30.

This move down may seem random, but using ""historical seasonality"", this was expected to be a rough week. Those using solely technical or fundamental analysis without using data such as seasonality can miss out on some important variables that show more of a full perspective.   


Many people do not know what week of the year May 10-14th is off the top of their head. By using the ""seasonality"" tool on the platform, users would have been able to quickly see that this was the 20th week of the year as well as the win rate for this particular 5-day period. By using seasonality, it was evident TSLA was moving into a very weak time of the year measuring back since the 2016 lows. In this case, the 20th week of the year closes higher than the 19th week of the year's close 0% of the time. In other words, the 20th week of the year closes lower than the 19th week of the year 100% of the time over the last 6 years (including last week's red close).

Below is a letter they had issued to their investors, as per the website 'Seeking Alpha'. Looks like someone more wants to be proved wrong!!  🚀  🚀  🚀

\*\*We took a small short position in GME (167 USD). We will continuously hedge the position to avoid being forced out at an inconvenient moment for an inappropriate reason.

The risk is that the market continues to value GME more like art, as to say there is no direct link to the capacity of generating earnings. It could be a symbol for the art of betting against the suits (that’s how many of these social media participants call Wallstreet’s elite). GME stands for the social media provoked short squeeze, like Kleenex for tissues, Zamboni for ice resurfacer, or Jakuzzi for a bubble bath. Any important influencers can restart the currently weakened spread of the narrative. Knowing this, other market participants might bet on exactly this occurrence and by their actions, increase the probability of it.

However, I believe that time runs against them. The spread of the narrative tends to weaken over time. There will be new exciting subjects in our fast-moving world.

The whole trade is based on masses trying to destabilize the offer and demand of the shares. There is no double cushion as to say that the holder benefits at one point from an intrinsic value in the form of dividends or liquidation (the trust of being able to perform both is often sufficient). This makes the trade very fragile during stressful market conditions.

We should not forget that GME is still a retail company that faces declining revenues due to the online streaming competition, a company that has been looking for a buyer for years. Of course, the 550 million USD that the company managed to raise will influence its odds, but does this justify a 10-billion USD difference outcome? Also to be noted is that the company lost several key people.

Many market participants have been caught on the wrong side of this trade. They will anticipate that this can happen again and take precautions. So, several significant hedge funds do not publish their short book on social media anymore to avoid becoming a target. Option sellers will increase the price of the concerned call options to make the trade less attractive.\*\*

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6zj08b31uhz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a9bc191496ffee458247c237e0945fcc4da515)

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uup5fji2uhz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d272f91bec8cb3d3146b84b850f7f17bbc0c1cf)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model.  

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. 

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.  

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. 

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I'm interested in better understanding the maths behind the computation of the values of a given stock. Not ROI or anything related to investment strategies.

The stock market is a transaction based system, people buy and sell (with different mechanisms) and a stock value fluctuates based on those transactions.

Assuming that a stock is worth $100 when buying what is the mathematical process to compute the stock value after one transaction ? What are the parameters that are being considered ? 

I saw many things about evaluating the value of the stock for pre-IPO companies and I know that in some occasions actual people can do some arbitration on them but it seems very unlikely that this is not already automatized.

dont buy into any random stock that just had its first price listing and shot up 30% the first day, i lost a lot of money when i first started this way, and ended up losing about 35% of my initial investment

dont use money youre not willing to lose and dont get your hopes up

profit is profit, dont shoulda woulda coulda yourself into oblivion, dont sell a stock and look back a week later seeing that it shot up and regret selling, if you made a profit you made a profit

dont be scared of selling at a loss, if your strategy is quick trades and one stock ended up not working out sell it and move it into something else that could potentially make you a lot more, you actually lose money by not selling at a loss, you lose your potential gains

as long as you stay above the 8-10% profit mark youre doing good, try to maintain how much money you make off your trades at least at this level

watch for pump and dumps, if it shot up for no apparent reason on a thursday morning leave it alone

lurk a lot of stock subreddits such as penny stocks and stock market subreddits, read other peoples DD (due diligence) which is basically their research into a stock, read their DD because this way you naturally pick up a habit of how to read a stock, you just understand and see indicators

dont trade on emotion or pride, if you get like an adrenaline rush and your heart is pumping and your brain is telling you to sell everything or to buy in with all the money you have literally either go to sleep and check back in when you wake up or an equally viable strategy, just go jack off and let the post nut clarity tell you what to do, you'll feel much more relaxed and calm telling you what to do or not to do

ndlijg,,StockMarket,post,1621161185,"Option Greeks Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m continuing on a series where I breakdown and simplify option concepts while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. Today I’ll be breaking down the Greeks and how they relate to an options price 

The Greeks simply represent the expected change in an options price based on factors which include price movements of an underlying relative to an options expiration date, time decay, and changes in implied volatility. Let’s dive into each of the individual Greeks below

**Delta**

Delta is the expected change in an options price for a $1 move up or down in the underlying security. Do note that Call and Put options have different delta natures.

Call options have positive deltas (+) . Option positions that have positive deltas will increase by its delta for a $1 increase in the underlying and decrease by its delta for a $1 decrease in the underlying. If a call option that has a delta of +0.40 is trading at $2.50/$250, a $1 increase in the underlying will cause the call option to be expected to go up by the delta of 0.40 to $2.90/$290. If the underlying had instead dropped by $1, the call option will be expected to go down by 0.40 to $2.10/$210

Put Options have negative deltas (-). Option positions that have negative deltas will increase by its delta for a $1 decrease in the underlying and decrease by its delta for a $1 increase in the underlying. If a put option that has a delta of -0.25 is trading at 1.50, a $1 increase in the underlying will cause the put option to be expected to drop to 1.25/$125. If the underlying had instead dropped by $1, the put option will be expected to go up by $0.25 to 1.75/$175. 
By using simple math, you can see why this is so. As a put option has a negative delta nature,  When the stock drops $1, the negative delta is subtracted from the options’s price. If you take $1.50 -(-0.25) this comes out to $1.75 due to the fact that when you subtract a negative number, the result is a positive number being added. If the stock increases, then the negative delta of a put is added to the options price. 1.50+ (-0.25)  which results in a subtraction and comes out to $1.25

**Gamma**

Gamma is the rate of change of an options delta for a $1 change in the underlying. Yes, Delta is dynamic and is constantly changing. After a $1 change, not only does an options price change but so does an option’s delta. This change of an options delta is caused by gamma. For call options, gamma is added to a call options positive delta for every dollar increase in the underlying. Conversely, gamma is subtracted from a call options positive delta for a $1 dollar decrease in the underlying.

For put options, the opposite is true. Gamma is added to a put options negative delta for a 1 dollar increase in the underlying, and subtracted from a put options negative delta for a 1 dollar decrease in the underlying. In other words, a put options delta becomes more and more negative as the underlying decreases and less negative as the underlying increases.

Take this into account with the following statement: Gamma is the highest ATM and the closest to expiration. To fully demonstrate how gamma works lets take a look below.

SPY is trading at $385. A Feb 19 2021 SPY 380 Put costs $3.20 and has a current delta position of -0.30. For a 1 dollar move down, the put increases by the -30 delta (3.20-(-0.30) =3.50) now the new delta is -0.32. this means to say that for the next dollar decrease of the underlying, the put option’s premium will increase by $0.32. This indicates that gamma is 0.02. When the stock drops again, the put option increases by $0.32 to 3.75 and its new delta is -0.35. This time, this indicates that gamma was 0.03 as the puts positional delta changed from -0.32 to -0.35. As you can see, gamma appears to be increasing from 0.02 to 0.03 as gamma increases as an option gets closer to being ATM. In this case as the stock drops, the stock is closer and closer towards the puts strike price.

Nature: Gamma is highest ATM and the closer an option is to expiration

**Theta**

Theta represents the amount of extrinsic value that will be reduced from an option’s premium for 1 passing day. Perhaps the more popular Greek in the world of options, theta is an option buyers kryptonite. As options are time decaying assets, theta reflects the expected decrease of an options extrinsic value for each passing day for the reason that an option will have lesser and lesser time to make a significant move (such as for an OTM option to move ITM by expiration) and (an ITM option to continue moving deeper ITM by expiration).

The general rule of thumb is that options have accelerating theta as expiration approaches. This means that the extrinsic value decrease of an option for each passing day increases all else being equal. Therefore in general, options experience a rapid decrease in their premiums in the final days of expiration.
A call option trading at 0.80/$80 that has a theta value of 0.10 is expected to decrease by $0.10 to $0.70/$70 for that one passing day, all else being equal. Subsequently theta increases for the next passing day. 

Nature: Theta is highest ATM and the closer an option is to expiration (for ATM options)


**Vega**

Vega represents the expected change in an options price for a 1% change in implied volatility (IV) . Implied volatility is the volatility value in an options extrinsic value. (If you missed the previous topic on implied volatility, click here.) As implied volatility rises, so does an options premium. Conversely an option’s premium decreases as implied volatility drops. 
For example, a put option is trading for $1.50/$150 and has a vega value of 0.10.  if implied volatility rises by 1%, the option is expected to increase by 0.10 to $1.60/$160, if implied volatility drops by 1%, the option will be expected to drop by 0.10.

Nature: Vega is highest ATM and the further away an option is to expiration.
 

**It is important to note that the Greeks are just market estimates and expectations of how an options price will change. Ultimately, the market determines exact prices**

ndj7lu,,StockMarket,post,1621151132,"Psychology of TradingHello fellow investors. During some research I was doing for a presentation on the psychology of trading in the stock market, I came across a few pieces of information that I thought were too important to keep to the small group I was planning on presenting them to. I think the second point is *potentially* more noteable than the first, but doesn't have as much direct evidence and it's related to gambling specifically, however, I believe there can be a lot of psychological crossover between short term trading and gambling, especially in the days of Robinhood.

The first idea came from an [2015 Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettsteenbarger/2015/03/16/turning-setbacks-into-successes/?sh=3e43097ff51c) by psychiatrist Brett Steenbarger. Steenbarger studied traders full time and noticed something about how different traders handled losses. Steenbarger put traders into 3 categories.

1. The first group were traders who kept trading after losing and usually increased their risk. They were primarily driven by frustration, refused to quit, reacted to the lost as a personal offense, and **ultimately blew up due to ""destructive decision making"".**
2. The second group, also frustrated by losses, were those determined not to let these losses pile up. This group would leave trading after losses so they could calm down, usually cutting themselves off from trading for the rest of the day until they regained ""emotional equilibrium"" so they did not trade on frustration. **This group rarely blew up but neither did they excel.** 
3. The third group was, like the others, frustrated with losses, but rather than doubling down or leaving, they stayed at their desk and channeled their frustrations into figuring it out exactly why they traded poorly and did not stop until they figured out exactly where they went wrong. they would not trade again until they had figured this out. **This group, over time, proved to be the most successful.**

I highly recommend reading the article if you want to dig deeper into the psychology, but basically, successful traders were the ones who fully embraced their failures as opportunities to learn. They did not *react* emotionally, but they DID use their emotions to drive their *purposefully direct action* toward scrutinizing their mistake *before* they made a single further move financially.

The second important piece of information I discovered on accident while watching ""Money, Explained"" on Netflix. I was not watching this for research purposes but just for learning and entertainment. In episode 4, ""Gambling,"" a study using monkeys was brought up to demonstrate a phenomenon our brains go through when gambling. Now, obviously the goal for most of us in the stock market is not to gamble... unless it is. Or unless you are gambling without realizing it. Regardless of how you're playing the market (or think you are playing the market?) I think this is incredible interesting and valuable information.

I *think* this is the study that Netflix was referring to: [http://www.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/\~kyama/kitazawaz/Ljungberg1992.pdf](http://www.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kyama/kitazawaz/Ljungberg1992.pdf). However, because I'm not 100% sure, I will explain it the way ""Money, Explained"" laid it out.

According to Netflix's ""Money, Explained,"" in a study with monkeys, researchers measured the monkeys’ dopamine when they were given juice. The juice increased their dopamine. This helped them get a baseline. Next, they gave the monkeys a signal, and then if a monkey touched a lever following the signal, they would be rewarded with juice. They would train the monkeys on this pattern. Once the monkeys were trained, they started measuring the dopamine activity in the monkeys’ brains during the whole process: stimulus, lever action, juice time. At this point, it was the stimulus -- the one indicating the monkeys should touch the lever -- itself that raised the monkeys’ dopamine levels. After the signal, when they touched the lever, the dopamine had already gone back down. When they got the reward – the juice – for touching the lever, it didn’t affect their dopamine at all.

In gambling, they call this ""the zone."" NOW I'm going to speculate a bit, however, I do believe evidence exists to back this up (certainly anecdotally if not scientifically.) 

Here's a scenario: Gambler gets a big win. Let's say they won $1,000. It feels great. They keep playing because they want that feeling again. They luck out! They won another $1,000. However, it didn't feel as good this time as it did the first. Some people might take this as an indication to quit. But some won't. Some are there for the dopamine hit, and at this point, the real hit is coming from the anticipation, not the payout. So they keep playing despite their best option being to leave.

I understand it may feel like a stretch, or annoying, to compare trading to gambling in this second part of my post, but as somebody who has kept trading after a major win when I should have packed my bags, I felt like this was fascinating, important, and insightful information.","['NFLX', 'T', 'A']"

They've already signed a contract worth $22.5M worth of it's products back in late February but prematurely announced the company who made the purchase because are still finalizing that deal. Sales from that contract alone will be worth 3x its current market cap.

The stock price has slowly declined a massive 80% since making the announcement due to youtubers pumping the news and ATWT selling its stock to purchase SafeBus Technologies. On May 31, they will finalized their acquisition and I'm sure there will be an announcement for that as well. I think this gives us a fantastic buying price now.

This is an OTC limited stock that has already sent in an attorney letter to become pink current. Thus is HUGE news and here's why.. Some brokers only allow pink current OTC stocks to be bought and sold on their brokerages. This will give many more investors the opportunity to invest in ATWEC Technologies who couldn't before.

ndqj1o,,StockMarket,post,1621178317,"HeWhoSleepsNot random market report 5/16/21Let me ask you a question, how many times has this happened to you? Or this? \[people dropping bread\].

Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

Doctor: “We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!”

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

&#x200B;

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

&#x200B;

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

&#x200B;

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

&#x200B;

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

The  bull era HAS JUST STARTED!

**How did Floyd Mayweather become such a legendary boxer?**

He understood the human behaviors of his adversary.

Repeatable sequences his opponents like to throw, over and over. He observed and learned.

He was then able to anticipate and get that edge we are all looking for!

**The same approach with the charting .**

Check out the identified structures. Amplitude and length doesn't have to be the same, but the pattern. Then observe the subsequent moves in silver price once those patterns completed!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

You must understand the HUGE tidal wave in motion that will sky rocket silver prices.

This is the M2 money supply vs gold. Currently gold is waiting for the latest explosion in M2 to unwind as it let's the 12 month moving average catch up.

Take away for this chart is the time bomb... Tic Toc....

Okay, this is THE chart you guys wanna see. Well, same as it's big brother gold... it has a +900% move baked in the cake. From a silver price of around 27$, that brings it up in excess of 200$ for 3 years period . This is life-changing money if played right.

Now, here is the actual picture. WTF?!?! Pretty insane M1 money supply expansion. That is fuel for silverto climb up. Like some folks say, it's gonna need a rocket ship now to catch up.

As said at the begining Silver is about to explode if we are in or not . !!!( This not financial advice do always you dd before any investment decision ) Don't forget I'am an ape like you not a financial adviser...

My actual position : I have 1.700 ozz physical silver + 7 ozz gold ( for my kids school my wife safe )  . silver is my nowadays my favorite to hedge against inflation

ne1dqd,,StockMarket,post,1621209035,"MATERIALS - Trinseo (TSE) - STRONG VALUE PLAYTrinseo looks to be in the beginning of a breakout. The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but there have been very few revisions by the lazy analysts and algorithms. 

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE!

ndlvca,,StockMarket,post,1621162669,"Iamgold: Undeervalued and unpopular[Iamgold](https://www.iamgold.com/English/home/default.aspx) is one of the most undervalued mid-tier producers of gold, period.

And in addition to being undervalued, the company is growing. Already producing \~650koz and building a new gold mine in Canada, Côté gold, Iamgold will be producing around 1 Moz in two to three years.

## Production Assets

The main producing assets of Iamgold are distributed between West Africa, South America, and North America.

**Rosebel**, in Surinam, produces \~240 koz per year with AISCs of $1225/oz, and the mine life extends up to 2033.

**Essakane**, in Burkina Faso, produces \~400 koz per year with AISCs of $1100/oz. The mine will have similar output until 2026, from then on, the production will be reduced to some 80 koz until 2031

**Westwood**, in the Abitibi Gold Mining Camp, Canada. This mine stopped last year due to some seismic events. Its activity will, most probably,  be resumed this year, with an estimated production of 50koz, approximately half of the nominal production of Westwood. Iamgold has acquired two properties in the vicinity of Westwood with the idea to further increase the throughput of the mill.

## Development Projects

With enormous difference, the main development project of Iamgold is the Côté gold mine. It is expected to start commercial production in 2023, with an initial production during the first five years of nearly 500 koz and AISCs of $600. Iamgold owns 64.75% of the project, which equivalent production will be more than 300 koz per annum.

The second project in the pipeline of Iamgold is Boto gold, in Senegal. The construction decision has not been taken yet, but once the mine starts operation it will add more than 150 koz per year to Iamgold production, at least for 11 years.

## Comparison with Peers

If Iamgold is compared with a selection of gold miners of similar size, then it is possible to check how cheap Iamgold is. So let’s see how ranks Iamgold in several valuation items

**Sound Balance sheet:** Iamgold has a negative net debt. And it has almost half a billion dollars of surplus in cash and cash equivalents, almost 40% of the Enterprise Value (EV) of the company. Iamgold has no problems financing the construction of Côte gold, which will take at least $M600. That is a strong point in favor of IamGold. Let’s say that Iamgold will not only not bankrupt in the short to medium term but also is not going to have problems funding the Côté gold mine and there will not be dilutions that will harm the long-term investor. If we compare Iamgold’s net debt with that of their peers, most of them with higher market capitalization, we can see that Iamgold has the best value.

**Column visibility** **Copy** **CSV** **Excel** **PDF** **Print**Show 102550100 entriesSearch:**CompanyTicketEV / EBITDANet Debt / EVAlamos Gold Inc**AGI8.3-8.7%**B2Gold Corp.**BTG4.8-1.0%**Eldorado Gold Corp**EGO3.90.0%**Harmony Gold Mining Co.**HMY15.21.9%**Iamgold Corp**IAG2.9-35.3%**New Gold Inc**NGD5.619.1%**Yamana Gold Inc**AUY6.115.5%Showing 1 to 7 of 7 entriesPrevious1Next

**Low EV/EBITDA ratio:** Iamgold has a terrific EV/EBITDA ratio of only 2.9. When compared with peers of similar size, Iamgold ranks, again, in the first position. Eldorado Gold, the second company with the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio, has a ratio of 3.9, sensibly higher than Iamgold. With this ratio, Iamgold is a steal.

**Terrific Resources:** Iamgold has impressive reserves of gold. More than 14 Moz, which give a very low EV/Reserves ratio, only $84 per gold ounce. The ratio is one of the lowest when compared with similar companies. From the selected companies only Harmony has a better ratio. With the current production, Iamgold has more than 20 years of production covered.

**EV/Production ratio:** In this case, Iamgold ranks again first. Buying Iamgold at current prices implies acquiring one ounce of produced gold per year at slightly over $1800. Companies such as Alamos Gold, Yamana, or B2Gold are selling at prices higher than $5000.

**Medium AISC:** The AISC of Iamgold are around $1200. That means that once Westwood ramps up  and Côté Gold produces the nominal gold production, the AISC will decrease. In an environment of increasing gold prices, that will improve the economics of Iamgold.

**Low Payback:** Payback is the time that is needed to get the money back from buying one ounce of current gold production. If a certain amount of money is paid for the production of one ounce of gold (EV/Production ratio), then this ounce is sold at the gold spot price, and the costs are the AISC, then it can be calculated how much time is needed to payback. With current values of AISC and gold spot prices, Iamgold has the lowest payback, only 3.11 years. With increasing production, this parameter will improve further.

**Increasing production:** The ounces produced by Cote and Westwood not only will increase the total production of Iamgold but will also decrease the average AISC of Iamgold. So the economic improvement will be twofold, one of them because of the increase in gold production and the other related to an increase in the margins.

## Organic Growth

Côté gold mine construction has already been approved, and it is expected that commercial production will start at the end of 2023. There is a clear construction plan and Iamgold has enough cash to build it. Commercial production will increase significantly Iamgold production at least for two to three years. Also, another good point is that the expected AISC are going to be significantly lower than the current AISCs, so it is expected that the mean will decrease and the economics of Iamgold will be even better.

## Merge and Acquisition Target?

With this low valuation, Iamgold is a perfect target for acquisition. Côté gold is a tier-1 mine in a stable jurisdiction, a sweetie asset for the majors. Even if Iamgold does not own completely Cote (a 64.75%) it is an interesting asset that could trigger the desire of different big producers. A hypothetical acquisition, even at a fair premium with respect to the current market cap, will not benefit Iamgold investors.  
The management has stated publicly that they are not interested in merge and acquisitions, something that will, in my opinion, harm Iamgold investors as the potential is huge.

What could benefit Iamgold is a merger with a company with similar resources, production, and low valuation. The company that better fits with this description is Eldorado gold, another undervalued company, with enormous resources and a big project, Skouries, coming in line in the next years. A merge of Eldorado and Iamgold will create a close to 2Moz producer, with a strong presence in Canada, diversifying the operating mine portfolio, and therefore reducing the political risks of both companies.

It will be a win-win operation for both companies and their shareholders.

## Undervalued and Unpopular

Iamgold is terrifically undervalued. It is undervalued, and it is enormously unpopular, so unpopular that has only 274 followers on Twitter, so few that I will soon overtake them 

Compare them with the 9.6M followers of Tesla, there is some room to improve, isn’t it?  
And no, I do not think I will soon overtake Tesla in the number of followers, although I wish. I think that I will not achieve it, at least not in the short-term 

## Final consideration

Iamgold is really undervalued: low EBITDA, enormous reserves, terrific organic growth, huge negative net debt, enough cash in hand to fund the construction of new mines, low market cap, unpopular, what else could you ask?

For me, it is clear, so clear that I have been increasing my position in Iamgold.

ncrnn0,,StockMarket,post,1621056831,"Is technical analysis science or pseudoscience? I wanted to find out. Sourced.TL;DR - It looks like technical analysis doesn’t stand up to scientific scrutiny in any study I could find which took steps to filter out the effects of self fulfilling prophecy. I, personally, am choosing not to engage in it any further.

I was starting to learn technical analysis. However, I wasn’t getting any good results when backtesting (after I caught myself and took steps to stop myself from exerting my own confirmation bias on my tests). So I decided to try to dig into the science behind it to see if spending any further time studying it would be worth it.

I’m being careful here not to cherry pick data. The reason I’m focusing on the articles I’ve linked is because they are the ones that bothered to take into account and take steps to eliminate results skewed by self fulfilling prophecies and confirmation bias. Aside from the last one which I included because it was the most comprehensive one I could find.

I wanted to know if technical analysis actually works. I didn’t want anecdotal evidence. I wanted scientific evidence.

This is what I found.

This first bit of research is by far the easiest to understand as it isn’t written in scientific jargon. It’s not quite as scientific as the others and was done by one person who had the same questions I did.

https://towardsdatascience.com/does-technical-analysis-work-heres-proof-a2b626a3fbe9

They tested MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator.

They found that for all asset classes, with the exception of one, technical analysis had zero alpha. (No gains)

They were tested standalone and in combination with other indicators.

The only exception they found was Bitcoin, but they also threw in the side note that Bitcoin is primarily a retail driven asset and as retail investors believe in technical analysis it’s more likely that the combined buys and sells due to the belief in the indicators were causing the indicators to work and not the other way around.

However they did point out that, seemingly ironically, reversing filtered indicators had some slight positive alpha for non Bitcoin asset types.

They did mention they would have to test a much larger sample set to see if the Bitcoin alpha or the indicator reversal alpha with other asset classes would hold up.

But the correlation for other asset classes was so slight they acknowledged it wouldn’t be profitable.

Let’s look at another study. Now we’re getting really scientific and busting out mathematical equations with symbols that most of us can’t even read.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017736799

They tested out some popular candlestick patterns on a market in Thailand over a 100 year period (they picked Thailand emerging markets to avoid the issue of data snooping). They tested the candlesticks along with Stochastics, RSI and MFI. They tested a number of different holding periods as well. 

They found that the candlestick patterns were not statistically significant and would not result in positive returns even when combined with other indicators.

Let’s look at yet another study. This one contains a bit of a case study but they do their own work to draw their own conclusions.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967202/

This one is the only one that focused at all on resistance. They basically determine that the probability of bouncing correlates with the growth of the investors trust on following bounces. Essentially, it is a self fulfilling prophecy and the resistance lines only form because of the investors growing trust in the probability of a bounce.

The following is this real gem here.

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis-Macedo-8/publication/349608864_An_Inquiry_into_the_Validity_of_Technical_Analysis_in_Financial_Markets_With_the_Use_of_Evolutionary_Techniques/links/60382c624585158939cdaeec/An-Inquiry-into-the-Validity-of-Technical-Analysis-in-Financial-Markets-With-the-Use-of-Evolutionary-Techniques.pdf

It’s really long. It’s really comprehensive. Though the authors do note their own results are inconclusive and this is more of a discussion starter. They did find a few actual positive correlations between certain samples, however they also did note that they were only reproducible during certain time spans.

I will wager my own best guess that the historical time spans where they did work were most likely the time spans where those methods were most frequently being used in those markets and could potentially be explained away as self fulfilling prophecies since as far as I could tell this is the one study I listed where they didn’t necessarily use criteria that would exclude that bias from the results.

What will I gain from the hours of reading I just did on these topics? I will conclude that technical analysis is not something which I will personally put any more time into learning. I think any of the proven correlations which I could find were not significant enough to result in gains, especially after taking slippage and brokerage fees into account. Furthermore, the methods which did have a positive correlation only seemed to be effective during certain historical times or in domains ruled by retail traders due to the self fulfilling prophecy.

In addition, quite a bit of information in some of these studies showed that all of those indicators were outperformed by simple buy and hold strategies.

I’m sure that more than a few people will disagree with me here. But these are my own conclusions. Take from it what you will.","['T', 'A']"

ndt5sq,gycpm8r,StockMarket,comment,1621190470,"You can't be over-diversified, as long as you're capturing the correct variety of risk and sectors in the overall stock market. You're portfolio will slowly mirror that of the overall market more, which is less volatility and less reliance on good stock picking of a few stock choices.

What I would comment on is your stock picking seems to be limited to tech/internet based companies. This means you're not that diversified, except within that sector. Some of your picks in the sector are more stable and a few are more aggressive growth/volatile, so you have  good risk spread within the sector.

You're total market or major index ETFs are a very small amount of your portfolio and mostly limited to VOO. You're focusing heavily on new technologies that will be higher growth, higher volatility, and higher risk and you're ignoring companies in the market that have established businesses. Your portfolio will behave that way too. It will trend higher in good times, and go lower, faster in bad times.

So the problem is you're not that diversified at all, it isn't just about how many things you buy, it is about what you buy to obtain diversification.

To start with I would recommend 2/3 of your portfolio be some mix of VOOG, VOOV, DIA, and QQQ starting out. Over time you will notice trends in how these move differently from one another or with one another.

These 4 things alone will make your portfolio far more diversified than it is now and less volatile.

VOOG and VOOV is the same as VOO, but it splits up the growth and value stocks. I do this, because over time I rebalance between the two based on what I think long-term market prospects are. I take more risks sometimes, sometimes I get more cautious and focus on value investing.

QQQ indexes the NASDAQ. This is more volatile, but gains have been higher in recent decades. 

DIA indexes the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

After that you can put small amounts of money into mid-cap ETFs, emerging market ETFs, and a small group of stocks or niche ETFs you feel like you've done your homework on and track closely.

&#x200B;

Learn to separate your own consumer habits and investing habits. Sometimes being a consumer it can help you see a trend, but largely just because we like buying something doesn't mean the company has good market pricing power, negotiating power with suppliers, a competitive advantage in the market, and many good companies I've owned are places I never shopped at or items I've never bought. I was able to take my personal purchasing choices out of the equation and focus on what that company could do with an advantage in their portion of the market. It also leads you to investing in consumer level products more. 

One small example I've done well over the year with the railroads, so I follow them and invest in them. Most consumers will never use them, directly. But many of the goods and services you do buy, had used railroads in the supply-chain.","['T', 'NDAQ', 'A', 'DOW']"

ndjp3p,,StockMarket,post,1621153229,"How to check if profits are believable, an accountants view. 

Focus on Cashflow over Profit to check if the Profits is believable.

Earnings & Free Cash Flow, let's look at the relationship between them.

Thread (1/15) 🧵⬇️

**1) Earnings and free cash flow are two measures of the same thing,**

How much money the company made from operating activities after deducting the cost of running the business, profit in other words.

**2) Free cash flow is the more literal measure**

If the company received money by selling products or services it is counted as revenue. If the company spent it on salaries, raw materials, machinery, or paying interest or tax, it is counted as a cost.

**3) The earnings figure, which also measures the amount of money left after costs.**

Is calculated using accounting rules to recognize revenue and costs in the same time period to produce a more accurate statement of a company’s financial performance.

**4) Huh? So what's the difference?**

The matching rules mean accountants use their judgment, to spread the cost / revenue over when they occur. For example -

\-Deprecate assets over time

\-Write of assets to loss on the P/L

\-Book revenue, when a company issues an invoice

**5) What does this means?**

Well, the above transactions can take place without any cash changing hands.

\-The company can issue an invoice, record revenue, and yet the customer has not paid.

\-Writing of an asset moves the value of the asset to the P/L but no cash in the bank.

**6) Its the accountant's judgement!**

The size of these adjustments depend on judgments made by a company’s finance department, how long a piece of equipment will last, for example, or when to book revenue

**7) It is reasonable to assume some will make judgements that flatter profit.**

Without these judgments though, revenue and profit, would come in great chunks. Some years a company might look extraordinarily profitable, years in which it did not invest for example.

**8) How to sense check profits?**

Check Exceptional items first. Before we compare cash flows to profit, we can check whether the company is inflating the reported profit figure by ignoring exceptional items

**9) Exceptional items Also known as**

\-One-off

\-Non-recurring costs

If a large proportion of the adjusted profit is the result of adjustments or the company routinely makes adjustments, it is sensible to question whether the costs are truly exceptional.

**10) Major tip - Follow the cashflow!**

The cash flow statement starts with reported profit, adds back non-cash charges and gains created by accounting judgments to arrive at operating cash flow.

**11) Even better**

By focusing your attentions on free cash flow it is possible to get closer to the truth about a company’s financial performance.

**12) What is free cash flow?**

In layman’s terms it is the amount of cash that a company has left over every year to pay its lenders and shareholders. It is essentially a company’s cash profits.

Importantly it is after taking into account expenses on capital. Therefore free cashflow is the cash the company generates which could be removed from the businesses without slowing down its growth!

**13) And importantly it is the company's profits free from accounting judgement.**

**14) The best ratios to check for high free cashflow?**

\-CROCI (Higher the better)

In essence, CROCI measures the cash profits of a company as a proportion of the funding required to generate them.

**15) If you scan the market for high CROCI companies its a great place to start a search for investable companies.**

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
> # Fed Ahead
> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
> # Retail earnings and housing
> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
> “The S&P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
> “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

> # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

> # ""Inflation"" Trends

> You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

> On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in GameStop Corp. GME need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",['A']

neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,post,1621257655,"$UWMC - The Long View$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It’s the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It’s CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it’s 12th employee and who’s dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC’s stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn’t have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi’s are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM’s long term perspective, so I’ll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ⅓ mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn’t crazy to think they could get back to ⅓ as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket’s retail channel has 4% margins and it’s partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM’s, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM “All In” Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don’t work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway’s partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I’m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

neo9ya,,wallstreetbets,post,1621277053,"AMC Simply saidLet me help you and break it down so you can make your own decision 

This is what’s going on…

AMC was attacked (shorted) because it was easy prey when covid hit, lock down, no revenue, stock drops.

Hedge Funds (HFS) took out short positions to capture profit on this which in normal business is fine. BUT they got greedy and used a legitimate process of creating a share for a temporary process and instead extended it and exploiting it over and over again to attack the value of the stock.

See, if they were successful in bankrupting the company all the synthetic shares would have been 100% profit and they would not have gotten caught.

But the CEO knew they were under attack and on Jan 27th 1.2b shares traded when the float was <200m. This was the tell, it showed there were too many shares on the market.

So the CEO had a proxy vote to vote in 500m more shares which got everyone fired up to vote as they didn't want to dilute the price AND the people shorting it got extremely excited as they assumed AMC needed the money so the dug in again and shorted more!!! With fake shares.

The AMC CEO then comes out days before the vote and said he listened to the 3.2m share holders and because they have enough cash to last past 2022 they will take the shares off the table, no dilution (brilliant!)

This trapped the HF who were expecting to get away with their manipulation.

Now there is another vote coming up June 2nd where once again holders will take part in a proxy, and this time all voters info will be captured so there is no doubt to the corruption of the HF.

The SEC and other regulators have been hidden during the blatant price manipulation BUT they have been busy making new rules to control the collapse and also to prevent this from happening again.

Where does that leave us now? 3.2m people would have to own the float many many times over, I myself have over 5k so the HF need to buy back the shorted shares or keep paying interest until they go broke or Margin Called. This is why it is expected to have a huge spike in price. How much who knows??  GME hit $500, and this is much bigger… and brokers won’t intervene this time to stop the squeeze…

So, what happens if the HF goes bankrupt? New rules will control the asset sell of the offending company to stop a crash of the holdings/market, then there is an insurance policy for these circumstances that has been increased to I believe 70 trillion dollars.

Interesting days are ahead…. This is lined up to be a massive shift In Wealth like the world has never seen before.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀Short Squeeze**.Short borrow costs skyrocketed from 30% to over 93% in a few hours on Friday: They cannot keep shorting at this price. It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀Gamma squeeze:**[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/options](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/options)

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** \*\*🚀UWMC is a good company, not just a memestock:\*\*UWMC is a good company that pays a good dividend, has a good CEO, and is the king of B2B mortgage refinance.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

nefwps,gyfxavm,wallstreetbets,comment,1621257771,"2 questions.

1. How many of those calls are sold naked? My guess is not as many as you'd think. I personally sold some $11 CC's as a way to lower my cost basis. Plenty of others did the same. Some don't even own shares and went with the PMCC strategy. Not every call needs to be hedged because they already are.

2. Does the interest rate to short a stock apply retroactively or just to new positions looking to short? I suspect it's for new positions looking to short. The brave souls who decided to short this stock at $7 are certainly dumb... But if they are only paying a few percent interest and they trust their DD, they may be able to avoid margin call long enough to see their thesis through without worrying about borrowing costs.","['D', 'T', 'A']"

nefrtj,,wallstreetbets,post,1621256815,"Monday Morning Analysis on $WELL $WLYYFMorning everyone, with the market acting the way it currently is I decided to do another TA on WELL Health.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1w7ibai2joz61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f35051fc0b07980181b14bdad493dfc7aa4958

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wqisl7e4joz61.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd01cd8896624817e553901bac203aec1b206adc

Now obviously Im looking at this week so let's look at the last week.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

nelwxu,,wallstreetbets,post,1621271546,"Crayon Make Pattern, Pattern Make Money - How to Draw and Trade with Channel Line Patterns and Technical AnalysisWhat if you knew where prices would go and when they would get there? It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,post,1621262752,"Western Digital - The Next NvidiaAs the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

My positions: ~$21k Western Digital, ~$6k Seagate","['AMD', 'FB', 'AMZN', 'T', 'WDC', 'NVDA', 'A']"

nepuii,,wallstreetbets,post,1621280761,"Corsair (CRSR) Double Down - It's TimeResubmitted because it was taken down for some reason. 

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We’ll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.  

Position: I am shorting the fk out of it because it seems like the prices of every DD on a fundamentally solid company goes to shit.","['NDAQ', 'COO', 'D', 'T', 'L', 'A']"

nds2vh,,wallstreetbets,post,1621182799,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model.  

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. 

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.  

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. 

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

It is both fitting and filtering that good things and good people are often secured within seemingly impenetrable vaults, guarded in towering fortresses across rivers with broken bridges. It tests one’s entrepreneurial spirit to build a new bridge, courage and confidence to cross it, creativity to improvise makeshift adjustments when the build comes undone, determination to scale those lofty walls, and candid introspection to ask yourself whether you really want it as you patiently chip away at the vault, with the hollow promise of tomorrow. Some desires are so painful in their depths, some ambitions so deep in their resonance, that they can only manifest as patience, probity, and perseverance.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","['WMT', 'HD', 'D', 'T', 'CSCO', 'A', 'TGT']"

2. Dropbox is building its marketting and collaboration tools, and no longer has a central office.

&#x200B;

3. Facebook workplace has grown to 7 million users.

&#x200B;

4. Dropbox has over a decades worth of stored images and files.

&#x200B;

5.Dropbox has acquired business tools like Docsend and Hellosign to compete with Adobe and Docusend, purchased at discounts under 300M each.

&#x200B;

6. Dropbox is well integrated with Facebook already in terms of file transfer and chat tools.

&#x200B;

7. Dropbox is ubiquitous in integrations across platforms like Zoom, Slack, and other major internet properties.

&#x200B;

8. Dropbox is fundamentally undervalued from a financial perspective, which makes it cheap for Facebook.

9. Facebook has recently acquired Kustomer, which is a customer-service and chatbots tool centered around their Shops.

10. Collaboration competitors like Adobe have acquired workfront. Salesforce has acquired slack. Microsoft has teams. Facebook will have Dropbox.

nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,post,1621273132,"Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?","['T', 'CME', 'A']"
nemlpe,gyh2gig,wallstreetbets,comment,1621275331,"Look up the difference between Contango and Backwardation (two terms to describe commodity forward curve structure). Right now raw goods are in Backwardation meaning near term prices are higher than farther out price. 

This price structure incentivizes more supply NOW as opposed to later, as well as the physical good to not be stored in a warehouse or elsewhere for future use. 

In short, demand is higher than supply in the near term. The forward curve is betting that more supply will be brought online in later months, or there will be less demand leading to lower realized spot price.",['A']

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow.

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

ndpiru,,wallstreetbets,post,1621175383,"This is not economic boom, this is just recovery !!!! The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn’t. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let’s dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   “confidence”                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *“weak confidence”* also affects the *“risk”* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly, this is a** ***“sentiment”*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***“planning”*** **to do something and** ***“doing”*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *“pent-up”* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *“pent-up”* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don’t have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***“pent up”*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *“booming.”*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,*** the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*“in 1998, the Federal Reserve “crossed the ‘Rubicon,’ whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‘debt burden’ detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.”*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in “confidence” is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *“inflationary pressures”* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***“getting back to even”*** **versus** ***“growing the economy.”*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

ne8d41,,wallstreetbets,post,1621231770,"Discussion: Reopening Trade (Air/Cruise, Casinos, Oil)I’m seeing macro trendlines of around 6 months (beginning November 6th, connecting around February 5th, and testing resistance right around now) in most of these stocks. 

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I’ll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I’m swinging for the MIL on this! 

I’m a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting “vaccinated” people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks. 

The market rewards those who risk more!............but only when you are correct in your prediction.

nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,post,1621267562,"MYOV - Back To Back CatalystsHi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I’m not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

**Positions**: 22.5k shares, 275 calls (mostly leaps).","['D', 'A', 'PFE']"

neostc,,wallstreetbets,post,1621278291,"UiPath - How lack of enough available shares can cause an artificial short squeezeUiPath is a software company for robotic process automation. Their software monitors user activity to automate repetitive front and back office tasks, including those performed using other business software such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software.

In April 2020, UiPath was named the top tech company and #2 overall in the Financial Times FT1000 ranking of Americas' fastest growing companies 2020[https://www.ft.com/americas-fastest-growing-companies-2020]. In June, UiPath was named to the CNBC 2020 Disruptor 50 ranking [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/uipath-disruptor-50.html]. In September, UiPath was ranked #3 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list for the second consecutive year[https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#37c358225f94]



Last month $path went public with only 23million shares as IPO. In addition, UiPath has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3,583,616. All together that's less than 25 million shares. 


ARK already snapped 6.4 million shares of path. Minus the ARK's shares, there are less than 19 million shares available. Any bulk call buying can trigger a huge run on shares as just 190k call contracts would require option sellers to buy every single available share from the market (incase they didn't cover their calls yet) .

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","['TWTR', 'T', 'A']"

nd9hyr,,wallstreetbets,post,1621115775,"UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPSUWM’s new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the “total yield” as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts’ estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",['A']

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors.","['D', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'T', 'AAPL', 'UPS', 'A']"

My local restaurants can't find people to serve me my favorite hamburger and Chipotle now wants to charge me more to make me a burrito.

I used to save all my paycheck that I used to spend going to the bar and picking up 8's that turned into 5's in the morning. I also saved the money I would spend going out to breakfast with said 5 in the AM drinking enough alcohol to turn them back into a 6.5 before we said our goodbyes.

Sometimes I would go to the mall and buy an Orange Julius or a Hot Dog On a Stick. Sometimes I would go see a movie or play paintball with some randoms just to pass the time. And other times I would just go to the local track and play the horses.

But during the pandemic all of that spending turned into gambling on stonks. Waking up early in the morning to read the message boards to see the next hot stonk. Buying calls on BJs and NIOs. Riding OSTK and GME to the moon. And spending hours on end reading Reddit posts.

But now that the economy is reopening I want to do all of that stuff again. Hopefully that 5 is still a 5 and not 300 lbs from binge eating while watching Netflix and Marvel movies on Disney +. Maybe I'll be able to find a mall that has most of its stores in operation and a movie theater with actual real good movies to watch. I want to go to the beach and get a tan. $#@& do I need one living in a cave during this last year.

This means I'll have less time and money to yolo on stonks. And since Biden and others want to stop the stimmy by the end of the summer. I imagine others will have to get a job too. Which means they won't have as much time to yolo as well.

What do you think will happen? What do you plan on doing? Why does everyone think this could all continue if the world is getting back to normal? And given your perspective, what are you doing over the next 3-6 months to take advantage?

nda9rc,,wallstreetbets,post,1621118098,"$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3XThe entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.","['NUE', 'T', 'A']"

For years options trading was limited to market makers and large institutions but now you too can swing with the big boys!

At the CBOE we believe that you, the retail trader, should be empowered to make irresponsible financial decisions and blow up your account just like the professionals.

Standardized options are highly leveraged derivative instruments that amplify your buying power to never before seen levels. Going all in on just three 0 DTE SPY calls a week have been mathematically proven to make you a millionaire in less than one year\*.

What are you waiting for? Ask your financial advisor if standardized options trading is right for you today, then disregard their dumb advice and do it anyway!

* **2021 Q1 ER Beat**

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed  ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** and Orladeyo actually generated ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

https://preview.redd.it/uppmf8dy09z61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=7215a9fc3d12ae2ead2bb782802742ef8ab998cb

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of **24.06%** in the **SP**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3dhmebmo39z61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8876fcc6c02233d347ec7bab257ef079d5ea74e6

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**.

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of patients they treat will slowly score up as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us to have an idea of how Orladeyo is doing in terms of gaining new patients, but it's not 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw97n7ga89z61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d353dc8fe919da2f4e10d6c5f68527c7cb7813b

If we sum up the numbers from the Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already, meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in the Q1, reasuring the exponential growth. This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in additional countries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Basically Biocryst has a drug called Orladeyo, which is the first Oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE). It is estimated that HAE affects 1 in 50,000 people.

&#x200B;

Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the **#13 most expensive drug** in the USA market. The price shown below **$37,308** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

* **USA**

&#x200B;

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to **485,000$**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Japan**

&#x200B;

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Europe**

&#x200B;

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

***Japan - 500p x 248,5K  = 124,250,000$***

***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of  ***$104,46***  in the stock price.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***CEO himself confirmed*** multiple times that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** As shown in the pic below, current cash runaway takes them into 2023.

* **Conclusion**

We are just about to witness how ***BCRX evolves*** from being a small-cap company to being a high-cap one. This will mainly happen due to the ***revenue generated by Orladeyo*** and the ***potential of BCX9930.***

Basically from now on each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX. Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP.

***Orladeyo*** undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a ***cash-cow***. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the ***most promising future is BCX9930***. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 which treats ***8 different diseases*** as of now, aimming for a potential ***40B market size by 2025***. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article [BCRX - The Embarrassment of Riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/).

I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities.

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

I also decided to raise my bets, so I will also shave my hairy legs, if I'm wrong:
